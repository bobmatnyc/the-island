  "text": "﻿FREE GROWTH AND OTHER SURPRISES\nDraft\nGordon Getty\nFOREWORD BY THE AUTHOR\nHow Come This Book?\nA few months ago, Robert Trivers was kind enough to send me his new book. The\ntitle is “Wild Life”. Perfect two ways. Bob is a world authority on wildlife, to wit\nevolutionary biology. But his books and papers about that are already well known.\nHis new one is about his own wild life, with his ideas in the background.\nI’ve started my own book three for four times over the past decade. Bob’s got me\nstarted again. Try it. It’s Bob’s real voice. One of his papers, co-authored by Huey\nNewton(!), is about deception and self-deception. I never saw much of either in Bob.\nI never saw a guy less anxious to impress. Fine if you knew his achievements, and\nfine if you didn’t. What he wanted to talk about was great new ideas by others. It\nwas from him that I first heard about the Hamilton-Zuk parasite theory, and Paul\nEwald’s complementary one about parasites stabilizing population density of hosts.\nBoth are beautiful examples of the obvious-in-hindsight.\nI realized that my book could take a cue from his. My own life hasn’t been wild. It\nhas been interesting because the genius of my father gave me interesting places to\nbe and things to do. I could say something about that.\nBut the book would be mostly about my ideas in economics. Bob’s ideas are well\nknown to anyone in his field. Mine aren’t. I’m ten years older than Bob, without\nmuch to show for it except in composition. (My last two operas have been getting\nsome traction, and my SACDs get pretty good radio time.) So I’ll run my economic\nideas up the flagpole, in my real voice, and see if they prove deception or selfdeception\nor something worth the time.\nDeclaring My Biases\nI’m a big free market fan. I would love it even if I agreed with socialists that there is\nsomething inherently iniquitous about it. There are bad guys and conflicted motives\nForward By The Author 04/18/16 1\nin markets and government both. What I love about it is the chance to prove ideas. I\nlove Wall Street innovations such as swaps and futures and ETFs and mortgagebacked\nsecurities, even admitting their dangers. And who would have thought that\nthe San Francisco Bay area, a stronghold of political correctness at the voters’ booth,\nwould nonetheless innovate Siri and Alexa and driverless cars, in its free market\nhavens here and there, over the past five years? Remind me the last innovation by a\ncommittee. Who would have thought we would make the world’s best car, the Tesla,\nin this labor stronghold? It takes guys who prefer the impossible. It takes guys like\nmy father.\nYes, that was J. Paul Getty. I’ll declare a bias for him. His faults were just what we\nread they were. I liked them fine. My times with him, with an exception I’ll note in\nChapter 1, are some of my favorite memories. I seem to be the opposite of pharaohs\nwho began their reigns by chiseling off their father’s names from the monuments\nand substituting their own. That was something about a ticket to the afterlife. I put\nmy father’s name on things I build. The afterlife will come as it comes.\nSince this book is about growth first, I should say how I feel about growth. Most\neconomists, which I’m anything but, treat it as a goal. I love innovation, which has\ntranslated to growth, while worrying plenty about growth itself. What happens\nwhen anyone can make a doomsday weapon on his desktop? Depressed people do\naway with themselves every day. Some might take the rest of the world with them if\nthey could. Armageddonist religions wouldn’t be needed. Not even destructive\nintentions need be. A doomsday weapon bought at the five and ten might go off by\naccident.\nThen why do I root for innovation when I’m scared stiff about its consequences?\nBecause alternatives are scarier still. Humans will innovate anyhow, while Big\nBrother or the religious authorities aren’t looking, and I don’t like the prospects of\ninnovation driven underground. We’ll have to find some way to face the risks and\nForward By The Author 04/18/16 2\nmanage them. This book doesn’t say how. It will open that can of worms, and others\ntoo, and try to track some but not all to their destinations. One look leads to another.\nThis shows that I’m not an optimist in the sense of making rosy predictions. But I\nseem to show that bias in evaluations. I’m two thirds Panglossian. (Doctor Pangloss\nwas the guy in Voltaire’s Candide who said that this is the best of all possible\nworlds.) I side with the good doctor in that I cannot imagine an improvement to this\nworld or to the human race. I see the dangers and evils, such as Armageddonists, as\nsomehow part of the scheme. The world would not be better if it posed no threats\nand challenges to solve. To solve them is not to wish them away. The stories of\nAladdin’s lamp and the monkey’s paw tell us that each wish after the first is to undo\nthe one before. I think that’s what Shaw was telling us in Don Juan in Hell. Don Juan\nand the others are free to go to heaven whenever they like, and occasionally do.\nThey come back because they can’t stand the boredom.\nWhere I find fault, and differ with Pangloss, is as to the doctrines we are taught.\nWhatever I study, I seem to find a good measure of nonsense taught along with\nwisdom. This book is about what I find of both in economics. And a problem I try to\nsolve, not wish away, is the danger of losing sight of the points on which Pangloss\nwas right. My verse and music try to remind us.\nAnd I’ll admit a bias for the surprises my title promises. I love upending what we\nhad all assumed. Fun! And all the more fun when I can show that famous economists\nhad already seen and said some of the same things I do when we read those\neconomists again. Surprise need not be true novelty. My free growth theory is really\nJohn Stuart Mill’s, although no one seems to have noticed the paragraph I quote\nfrom him. My next generation theory really belongs to my 17 th -century rhymesake\nSir WilliamPetty, who happens to be my nominee for greatest economist of all time.\nIn a way, I could also credit it to the period of production theorists John Rae, Nassau\nSenior, William Stanley Jevons and Eugen von Boehm Bawerk. They need only to\nhave considered human and total capital as explained by Petty two centuries before.\nForward By The Author 04/18/16 3\nThis reveals my bias for economic history. It seems dry as a bone until you find\nsomething terrific like those insights. It happens that I had written both theories,\nand published one, decades before I found those great precedents. Should I have\nbeen chagrined? Of course not. Forgotten or unnoticed precedents are at least as\nmuch fun to point out as the surprises they showed ahead of me.\nI will also reveal a bias for evolutionary biology. Its main axiom, the biological\nimperative, becomes one of mine. The idea is that behaviors are selected for\nsuccessful reproduction. I will try to show that the classical school treated this as\naxiomatic from Petty through Smith, Malthus, Ricardo and Mill. Malthus was only\nthe most obvious case. It lapsed from attention when a brilliant new insight called\nmarginalism preferred to do without explanations for tastes.\nAbove all comes my bias for the great thinkers in those fields. We saw that as to Bob\nTrivers. Although I often cite them to disagree with them, I see all as giants from\nwhose shoulders I slip in trying to climb. I don’t kick sand on 97-pound weaklings.\nMill was a mensch who gives us all lessons in attribution and generosity, particularly\nto schools he disputed, and who nonetheless didn’t mind being a minority of one in\nhis books or in parliament.\nPetty was something beyond. Polymath, self-made tycoon, anatomist, music teacher,\nfather of national accounts, originator of present value theory and human capital\nand next generation theory, and esteemed by both Adam Smith and Karl Marx for\nother innovations I don’t mention. Such men are understood slowly and\nincompletely.\nForward By The Author 04/18/16 4\nCHAPTER 1: RECOLLECTIONS\nI never finished a course in economics. I started one at the University of San\nFrancisco sixty years ago, and dropped it when I couldn’t see the foundations. But\nthe bug had bitten me. I knew that one day I would try on my own.\nI always loved logic. My favorite philosophers at USF were the pre-Socratics who\nliked nothing better than to confound common sense. A brilliantly vexing example\nwas Zeno the Eleatic and his argument that Achilles can never catch up to the\ntortoise; Achilles must first reach the line where the tortoise was last, and the\ntortoise has since moved on. Logic can play such tricks. But I sensed that economics\nwas the place to try its limits. Dropping the course didn’t mean giving up, and logic\nwould be the key.\nNeither did I take a course in business administration or investment. My major was\nEnglish literature. As a grade schooler I had asked my father about this. Where and\nwhat should I end up studying? He had read economics and petroleum geology at\nOxford, and I supposed he would advise something like that for me. I got a surprise.\nCareer-oriented majors were fine but not necessary. A grounding in the liberal arts\ncould be as much or more. The trick was to learn how to learn. That sounded right,\nand anyhow right for me. So I chose USF, a twenty-minute walk from home until my\nmother moved us to San Rafael, a half hour drive across the Golden Gate Bridge, and\nfollowed my intuitions toward English lit and history and music and philosophy.\nI graduated with a degree in English lit in 1956. This was the time of skittish peace\nbetween the Korean and Vietnam wars, and the Reserve Forces Act meant I had to\nreport for six months active duty starting in the spring of 57. Meanwhile I worked\nfor my father. I and my brother Paul, later Sir Paul, started at the bottom pumping\ngas and changing oil at separate gas stations not far from our home in San Rafael.\nThat left time for a few weeks at a bulk plant (oil warehouse and tank farm) in San\nFrancisco, still working at the bottom, before I reported. Paul had served in the\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 1\nKorean war, and was now exempt. I was a shavetail second lieutenant, thanks to the\nROTC program at USF, in the quartermaster branch at Fort Lee, Virginia. My\neyesight was never good enough for the combat branches.\nIke, who was then president, had started in the quartermaster too. My military\ncareer was not so glorious. Somehow I finished the six months at Fort Lee and seven\nand half years of inactive duty following, obligating me to one weekend per month\nat military posts near home, without being promoted even to first lieutenant. By\npolicy, I should have been promoted or busted to the ranks. I later learned that my\nschool chum Manuel Teles, who worked at Fort Presidio in San Francisco, had\nsomehow fixed the record. Thank God for old friends.\nMy weekends of saluting were postponed when Paul and I went back to work for my\nfather in 1958. My father then lived in the Ritz Hotel in Paris. He liked ordinary tworoom\nsuites. The sitting room was his office. His filing system was a steamer trunk.\nOur job was to sit and listen as he met with executives or art people or old friends.\nHe would usually take us along to lunch and dinner, and wangle us along when he\nhad been invited out. He was the world’s most attentive father whenever we were\nwith him, at least, if focused elsewhere when we weren’t.\nPaul went on to learn refining and marketing in Italy, after those few weeks in Paris,\nwhile I went to the oilfields my father had just found and developed in the Neutral\nZone between Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Paul soon learned Italian, became general\nmanager within two years, and ran things well. I learned only a little Arabic, but also\nbecame manager in 1959, and soon blundered my way into two weeks’ house arrest.\nI had got crossways with the local emir, Mohammed bin Nasr, not a bad guy, about\nperks and privileges he and his staff expected Getty Oil to pay for.\nThe case against me was rigged. One of our junior staff drivers, a Kuwaiti I think,\nhad accidentally rammed and damaged a pipeline. He had fled the country to avoid\njail. Jails there were no fun. His supervisor, Jim Kinnell, was warned that he (Jim)\nwas accountable under Saudi law, and would be sent to jail instead. Jim came to me.\nI realized what was brewing. Laws are flexible, and Jim would have got off with a\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 2\ncaution at most if I weren’t at odds with the governor. I was obviously next. But I\nwas not about to gamble that the threat to Jim was a bluff. I told him that if I were in\nhis shoes, I would go back to England. He did. That left me. But I was in my shoes.\nThe blunders had been mine, and I would face the music.\nMy two weeks of house arrest went peacefully. The plain cement-block house had\nbeen built for my father at our port camp of Mina Saud when he lived in the Neutral\nZone in 1953. The Emir’s identical house was a few steps away. My father’s favorite\nmaple sugar was still in the fridge. I read the few Shakespeare plays I hadn’t read in\ncollege, and read or reread the complete poems and plays of John Keats.\nThe house arrest was probably as much dressing-down as I deserved. Paul, or\nanyone else, would have handled the perks and privileges more adroitly. But our\nhost country, Saudi Arabia, may have picked up on something too. Getty Oil was not\none of the concession companies in the Middle East named in the baksheesh\n(bribery) scandals that made the front pages over the few years remaining before\nmost concessions were negotiated away and host countries ran things themselves.\nBack to my father in Scotland, where he was visiting his old friends the Maxwells\nnear Inverness, and then to the two-room suite at the Ritz in London about like the\none in Paris. He drove the six hundred miles between, in a vintage Cadillac, taking\ntwo days and stopping to visit historic sites and museums. He needed no guidebook.\nI sat in on meetings and events everywhere with him in London as in Paris. I\nassumed that the Saudis had cleared the house arrest with him, and I would have\nagreed as he did. He too was in different shoes. He was right. He had solved a real\nproblem with minimum damage. Lesson learned, and no hard feelings either way.\nIt was clear to both of us that I was not cut out to be a line officer, meaning one who\nruns things from day to day. My mind goes off on tangents instead of tracking\narguments in real time. It works for me, but not as an administrator. We decided to\ntry me as a consultant.\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 3\nThat began at my father’s Spartan Aircraft Company in Tulsa, Oklahoma. He hadn’t\nmeant to buy it. He had bought control of Skelly Oil, centered in Tulsa, and Spartan\nturned out to be one of its holdings. Then came Pearl Harbor. My father was 48\nyears old, and had been a yachtsman. He took a navigation course at USC along with\nkids half his age, led the class, and volunteered for sea duty. His old friend James\nForrestal, Secretary of the Navy, steered him to Spartan instead. Spartan could make\ntraining planes and could train pilots. My father accepted. He paid himself a salary of\none dollar a year.\nHe had decisions to make when MacArthur and Matzushita signed the peace treaty.\nThe training planes were not meant to leave the ground. Spartan lacked the\ncapacity to make the real thing up to competition. The demand for training planes\npretty much ended with the war. My father could sell out or find another use. He\ndecided to make house trailers. It worked. I had lived in a Spartan trailer in the\nNeutral Zone, like the rest of the senior staff, when I stayed at our Wafra oil field\nrather than the house at Mina Saud. We and the market had liked them fine.\nHerschel Shelton had been one of my father’s right-hand men during the conversion\nto trailers. He said that the place to look for him was never in his office. You would\nfind him in overalls under a trailer on the factory floor, with a welding iron or\nriveting gun. He liked to be able to do any job his workers did. How else would he\nknow if they were doing it right?\nI stayed in my father’s house at Spartan, as at Mina Saud. It stood at the opposite end\nof the runway from the offices and trailer plant. I drove another seasoned Cadillac\nthat my father had left in case he came back. Max Balfour, who ran Spartan, called it\na clunker. It clunked me around the countryside on weekends, or to Jamil’s\nrestaurant or Cap Balfour’s house for dinner, or downtown to the movies or\nsymphony or opera house. Cap (Captain) Balfour had flown in World War I, and\nshowed crippled hands from when his plane caught fire. He was cranky, urbane and\nrazor-sharp. His problem was that Spartan couldn’t seem to come out in the black.\nHe worshipped my father, and figured he had let him down. He seems to have\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 4\nbrought his moods with him after work, which my father generally didn’t. That cost\nhim his sunny young wife. I somehow got a pass. I could understand him, and I was\nmy father’s son.\nMy advice in the end was that my father should sell. Meanwhile I was taking an\ninterest in economics again. Business was about rate of return. Spartan’s was\nnegative. What was the benchmark? I did a little study.\nIt is easy to see that return tends to even out from one company or industry to the\nnext. We pour investment into high-return prospects, and unintentionally drive that\nhigh return down toward the norm by expanding the capital denominator. I didn’t\nknow that Robert Turgot had written the same in 1766. But what struck me was the\nimpression that return, net of inflation, seemed to revert to a norm over time. Why\nwere interest rates, averaged over business cycles, about the same then as in\nDante’s time or Julius Ceasar’s? Why should human impatience be a steady norm?\nThat puzzle nagged me for about a quarter century until I found the answer.\nAnother decade or two would pass before I learned that Sir William Petty had found\nit in the seventeenth century.\nI went home in 1961 to study harmony and counterpoint at the San Francisco\nConservatory of Music. I had found time to compose a few things at the house at\nMina Saud with a piano I had bought in Kuwait. They included an a cappella\n(unaccompanied) choral setting of Tennyson’s “All Along the Valley”, and something\nto which I later fit Emily Dickenson’s poem “Beauty Crowds Me” in my song cycle\n“The White Election”. The composer Charles Haubiel published “All Along the Valley”\nin his Composers’ Press in Los Angeles in 1959. The one change he suggested, an\nunexpected D flat major resolution, is the best touch in the piece. I had noticed\ncopies in music shops in Tulsa. So it seemed about time to develop that interest too,\nand the conservatory back home seemed the logical place.\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 5\nI studied there from fall 1961 through spring 1962. I was probably the only\ncomposition student already published. My teacher in both the fall and spring\nclasses was Sol Joseph. He was a legend there. Most of what he taught confirmed my\ninstincts. Maybe five percent was old rules I didn’t think much of, and five percent\ngood ideas that hadn’t occurred to me. All was useful anyhow as a guide to what\nleading authorities have thought and taught. That was the point. We were to accept\nwhat we liked, and anyhow learn the lingo.\nThose two courses covered traditions of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.\nMost composers in the 1960s, and probably some or most of my classmates, thought\nof that as a stepping stone toward study of the serialism and other atonalism then in\nvogue. I skipped those classes. I realized that I was a nineteenth-century composer\nat heart. Now the world seems to have spun back to where I was all along. For most\ncomposers now, atonalism is one of the colors on our palettes. Even I use some. So\ndid Bach. We reach for that color when we want to express disorientation or angst. I\nfound I could get more said most of the time with major-minor scales.\nFive short piano pieces I wrote then were published by Belwin Mills in 1964. As my\nfather’s son, you might imagine that I was asked to pay the costs. Nope. Neither had I\npaid a cent to Composers’ Press. Vanity press exists, but that was not the business\nmodel of those two firms. I got standard royalties from sales, not amounting to much,\nand they got the rest.\nSix published pieces by age 31 would not have impressed Mozart or Schubert. By\nlesser standards, it was a pretty good start. There are distinguished composers who\nhave never found a publisher. Tomorrow the world! I would write operas and\nsymphonies! What happened instead was sixteen years of writer’s block, or eighteen\nsince finishing the pieces in 1962. I suppose I was trying to say “Shazam!” and turn\ninto something I wasn’t. The ice would break in 1980, when I realized that Billy\nBatson would have to do. But that gets me ahead of my story.\nI married Ann in 1964, making it a banner year on that count even more than the\npublication, and went back to work for my father. That took us to New York in 1965.\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 6\nTidewater Oil Company, which would merge into its parent Getty Oil Company a few\nyears later, had red ink problems in its Eastern Division. My job was to see why.\nEastern Division was run by “Jim” Jiminez, an upbeat guy I liked. I don’t think he\ntook the red-ink problems home with him as Cap Balfour had. He reported to my\nhalf-brother George at corporate headquarters in Los Angeles, and George reported\nto my father in London. George had earned his job as president by outstanding\nperformance at every level on the way up, which is more than you could say for me\nin the Neutral Zone. But George was touchy. He had a chip on his shoulder. I think\nmy father liked to ride him, and he sometimes felt unappreciated. You have to shrug\nthat off. George was doing fine. The problem in Eastern Division was not in him, and\nit was not in Jim Jiminez. Then what?\nI looked at the books. The red ink had nothing to do with management. Eastern\nDivision did refining and marketing. Its new refinery in Delaware had been\noptimized to process heavy Wafra crude oil, which then was over a dollar cheaper\nper barrel on the market than the lighter and easier-to-refine crude we produced in\nTexas and the Central Basin. Tidewater’s Western Division refinery at Martinez, by\ncontrast, had all the cheap oil it needed in our own San Joaquin field. The Martinez\nrefinery was old, and more expensive to operate. But the net advantage still went to\nWestern Division by about a dollar per barrel. Meanwhile gasoline sold for about a\ndollar less per barrel, although only two or three cents less per gallon, in the\nrefinery-loaded east than in California.\nManagement can’t do much about import quotas and market conditions. I reported\nto my father that Eastern Division was at least as well run as Western Division,\nwhere the ink was black thanks to cheaper crude and pricier gasoline.\nThen could we cut costs or boost receipts in other ways? I proposed that we close\nour old and inefficient Boston Harbor terminal, where barges unloaded gasoline into\nour tank farms to be trucked to stations, and supply Boston from our new terminal\nat Providence two hours’ drive away. If that worked, other distribution\nconsolidations seemed possible. I later proposed much the same thing for our\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 7\noperations in Japan, where the new terminal at Kawasaki could theoretically obviate\nthe older and clumsier one in Tokyo Harbor. I realized that plant-closing might be\nunthinkable in Japan, but thought that something good might come of the idea.\nSometime a little later came my lawsuit against my father. It isn’t my happiest\nmemory. There had been a stock dividend years before, when I was still in school.\nWe had treated it a certain way on the books. I read the law as saying it should have\nbeen treated another way. The law was probably on my side, and common sense on\nmy father’s. Judge Peery wisely found a way to make common sense win in the end.\nMeanwhile I had accused my father of nothing worse than oversight. My visits to\nSutton Place, now with Ann and the boys, went the same as before. The lawsuit\nseldom came up and was discussed in easy terms when it did. I suggested to him, for\nexample, that he might want to settle with my stepmother Teddy in case there could\nbe claims by the estate of my late half-brother Timmy. He did. Somehow we got\nthrough the lawsuit without bad blood. One would not have guessed so much was at\nstake. The stock dividend had been a huge one. What I learned from my father, then\nmost of all, was perspective. He believed in an even keel. Zeno the Stoic, not the\nEleatic, would have met his match.\nThe lawsuit lasted from 1966 through 1971. In hindsight, thank gosh he won. If I\nhad, tax consequences would have been ugly all around. Again I had learned a lesson,\nand again there were no hard feelings either way.\nI continued to do consulting jobs for him throughout the lawsuit and after. I charged\nexpenses, but no fee. And I didn’t pad expenses. If I had, you can believe he would\nhave seen it. I stayed in a single room in the best hotels, ate three squares a day, and\npaid for anything else myself. I was trying to make the point that I didn’t want to be\npaid. Neither had my father at Spartan during the war. The idea was for me to be of\nuse. I was paid like everyone else when working for my father full-time, but never\non consulting jobs.\nThose now came once or twice a year, and lasted for a week or two each. Composing\nwas still on the back burner. I was keen on physics, economics, human origins and\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 8\ncity planning. It became clear that all but the third needed better math skills than I\nhad. So I bought the Barnes and Noble textbook on College Mathematics, got through\nit in a week of hard work, and then began on the Johnson and Kiokemeister textbook\non calculus along with Halliday and Resnick on physics. Together they took me\nnearly a year. At the end, I was allowed to sit in on the freshman physics finals at Cal\nBerkeley, where the same two textbooks were taught.\nIt was the finals for physics majors, and meant to be tough. Cal took physics\nseriously. Not every freshman was destined to go farther. Some should be steered\ntowards engineering, which pays better anyhow. There were 10 questions. Three\nhours were allowed. Each of us had a calculator and nothing else. Not even a table of\nintegrals. My God. I had to remember them or rederive them. There are some that\nhad taken even Newton and Leibnitz months to solve. I don’t remember any of the\nquestions. There were 200 to 300 kids in the room. Maybe 20 or 30 orientals, about\nthree women, no blacks. Not one finished early. And some figure to be Nobelists by\nnow. We’re talking about Cal. I had answered seven questions when the three hours\nwere up. Was that good enough? I got a call in a few days. I passed, and beat the\nclass average.\nMy old friend Matt Kelly warned me about this time that George was in trouble. Matt\nhad known George’s new wife Jackie, and had been invited to dinner there. Matt’s\nimpression was of out-of-control mood changes. He said that George at one point\nhad drawn him aside, shown a pistol and warned him about paying too much\nattention to Jackie. The next minute they were back at the table in jolly spirits. I\nlearned later what was wrong. George thought he had a weight problem, although I\nnever noticed one. Doctors prescribed amphetamines in those days to control\nappetite. They revved him up and made it hard to sleep at night. So the same doctors\nprescribed barbiturates at night to get him to sleep. Uppers and downers are\ndangerous enough. Add a drink or two and you’ve got trouble.\nOf course I should have told my father. But I didn’t want to be the one. I liked to\nboost my brothers. Many must have seen the symptoms Matt saw. Let them break\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 9\nthe news. But the others must have felt as I did. We waited too long. I got a phone\ncall in 1973. George had died at Mount Sinai Hospital. There was an empty bottle of\nsleeping pills.\nMy father’s death came in 1976. Ann and I had got word it was coming a few weeks\nbefore. We were there. So was Norris Bramblett, an accountant who had worked for\nmy father since I was in school. My father trusted him. So did I. He had only a fourth\ngrade education, but a PHD’s worth of character and sense. My father, Zeno the Stoic\nwhen things got tough, cracked jokes to the end. Norris alone could understand him\nby then. He translated patiently. My father was giving me one more lesson. He\nlapsed into a coma. Ann and I were called down from our bedroom when he died.\nThat left me and Lansing Hays co-trustees of the trust controlling his companies.\nLansing ran the law firm that handled nearly all my father’s business and little else.\nIt was a big job. Lansing was smart, abrasive, and dead honest. He didn’t mind\nhurting people’s feelings. I was not immune. It didn’t matter. It wouldn’t have\nmattered to my father. What mattered was that Lansing knew what trust meant, and\nput the Trust first. That’s what I cared about.\nLansing was already on the Getty Oil board. I was invited to join too. We met four\ntimes a year, most often in Los Angeles. Harold Berg, an oil engineer from Colorado,\nhad become CEO (chief executive officer) and chairman after George died. Sid\nPetersen, an accountant, was COO (chief operating officer). Harold was a warmer\nand more approachable personality. That’s what you’d expect in an oilfield guy. Sid\nwas reserved and analytical. That’s what you might expect from an accountant,\nalthough Norris Bramblett fit anything but the stereotype. Harold and Sid were both\nclearly well chosen. Neither then nor later did I doubt that Getty was run at least as\nwell as its big oil rivals.\nThe board too were top people. But trouble was brewing. The trust, meaning\nLansing and I, owned about 43% of the shares. The Getty Museum, also chaired by\nHarold, owned another 11%. Boards and managers prefer scattered ownership, so\nthat they can operate more freely. Second-best would be concentration in docile\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 10\nhands happy to follow the board’s guidance. But my father had made it clear to\nLansing and me that we were to trust our judgment. We should be ready “to vote the\nmanagement in and out.” Since stockholders elect boards and boards hire managers,\nthat meant to vote the board in and out.\nNo wonder they were concerned. Lansing and I were both boat-rockers. Wouldn’t it\nbe safer if there were a corporate co-trustee? These are usually safety-minded banks,\nand many banks did business with Getty Oil.\nConcerns rose when Lansing died in 1972. That left me as the sole trustee. I was less\nobstreperous than Lansing, but also less predictable. Hostile takeovers were\ncommon then, where bids are made directly to shareholders rather than cleared\nthrough the board. Getty was rich in oil reserves per dollar of share price. It could be\na target. Board members tend to feel that they know stockholders’ interests best,\nand that the angels are on the side of “friendly” or board-approved takeovers if any\nat all. Stockholders don’t necessarily feel that way.\nTemperatures rose when I pushed serious study of the possibility of taking Getty\nprivate. The idea was to give up our corporate structure to escape the corporate\ndouble tax. Management and its investment banker, Goldman Sachs, advised against.\nI now think they were right, although my idea had good precedents. I pressed on,\nunwisely, by trying to convince the Museum to back me. They had better sense.\nIt was time to heal the breach. Marty Lipton of Wachtell, Lipton, a top mergers and\nacquisitions law firm, represented the Museum. He proposed a moratorium (the\n“tripartite agreement”) where the Trust, Museum and company would hold the\nstatus quo for one year. Harold Berg had retired as chairman of Getty Oil, and Sid\nwas now chairman and CEO. His COO was Bob Miller, a keen petroleum engineer.\nHarold Berg still chaired the Museum, although Harold Williams was its CEO and\nmain voice. We all signed. But Getty Oil had its fingers crossed. A few days later, the\ncompany petitioned the court to appoint a co-trustee. It proposed Bank of America.\nB of A’s chairman, Chauncey Medberry, sat on the Getty Oil board. Paul and George’s\ndaughters joined the plaintiffs.\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 11\nThe Museum was more outraged than I was. Marty felt that he had been used. He\nand Harold Williams, a business-savvy guy who had chaired the SEC under Jimmy\nCarter, realized that if I could be hog-tied, the Museum with its 11% was the next\ndomino.\nThis was in November of 1983. Within a few weeks, the Museum and I signed a\n“consent of shareholders” taking over the company. The required public disclosure\nof this, on top of the tripartite agreement and co-trustee lawsuit before, was blood in\nthe water.\nPennzoil launched a hostile takeover bid in December. My concern was that the\ntrust should not be locked in a minority position. I met with Pennzoil in New York.\nWe resolved that to my satisfaction. The Getty Oil board met, also in New York, on\nJanuary fourth. The mood was not sunny. Harold Stuart, one of the brightest and\nfinest board members, assumed that I had invited the Pennzoil bid. Chauncey\nMedberry thought I should be sued. But Sid and the board acted responsibly overall.\nWe countered with a higher price, Pennzoil accepted, and we went home thinking\nwe had a deal.\nTexaco offered a higher bid two days later. Was Getty Oil already bound to Pennzoil?\nIts lawyers and mine said it wasn’t until the final agreement was signed. I had my\ndoubts. But I liked Texaco’s offer better, and my duty was clear. The Trust and\nMuseum would be paid cash for their shares, rather than locked in. I had insisted on\nlanguage in the Pennzoil agreement that bound me only as “consistent with my\nfiduciary duty.” My duty, in the light of legal advice, was to accept Texaco’s offer. I\ndid, and voted the same way as a member of Getty’s and the Museum’s board. Those\nwere fiduciary duties too.\nPennzoil sued Texaco, and eventually won punitive damages of some eleven billion\ndollars. The Museum and Trust had cashed out. We were not parties. The Pennzoil\nand Texaco filings both spoke well of me. But there was still the lawsuit seeking a\ncorporate co-trustee. That would have been very dangerous before the sale to\nTexaco cashed us out. A corporate co-trustee might well have assented to “corporate\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 12\ndefenses” blocking a sale and effectively locking the trust in a minority position. But\nnow that danger was over. The remaining plaintiffs were my three nieces and Paul. I\ncouldn’t blame them. How could a corporate co-trustee hurt?\nBut I was still worried. I now wanted to split up the trust into four separate ones for\nmy family, Paul’s, George’s, and my other half-brother Ronnie’s. Corporate cotrustees\ntend to prefer the safety of acting only as required, and anyhow might not\nbe keen to vote themselves out of a job.\nWere Paul and my nieces mad at me? Believe it. Lawsuits get that way. Lawyers on\nboth sides say nasty things. That lasted because splitting the Trust took time. The\nmath was easy, but the legal precedents were vague. My lawyer, Mose Lasky,\nthought we needed new California law. Plaintiff’s counsel didn’t think so. I was\naccused of stalling. Someone had the bright idea to approach Willy Brown as\nSpeaker of the Senate. The law Mose wanted had already worked in other states,\nand Willy liked it. He pushed it through. Problem solved. The Trust was split into\nfour in 1988, and an unhappy chapter ended. My nieces and I are as close as ever. So\nwere Paul and I until his death in 2002.\nMy interests by the time of the split were composing, verse, economics, human\norigins and evolutionary biology. Composing was going pretty well. My writer’s\nblock had melted away in the summer of 1980. Ann and I and the boys were in Paris\nthen. We wandered into Smith’s English language bookstore. I bought the Thomas\nJohnson variorum of Emily Dickenson’s 1800-odd poems. “Variorum” means\nincluding Emily’s own variations when she mailed the same poem to different\npeople, or put a copy in the chest at the foot of her bed.\nI read them all over the next two days. Emily had been one of my favorites at USF.\nShe died in 1886. She had published only eleven poems. Squabbles among the heirs\ndelayed publication of about half the rest until Johnson published them in 1959,\nthree years after I graduated. Many already published had been “bowdlerized” to fit\nconventional rhyme and grammar. Johnson gave us the real McCoy from her\nmanuscripts. All was new to me.\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 13\nI had no piano in our hotel room in Paris, but set a few of the poems in my head to\nwrite down later. More followed. One of her poems I didn’t set begins “Mine by the\nright of the white election…” Election meant choice. Her white smock hangs today by\nher bed in Amherst where she was born and died. White is the color of weddings\nand burials. Her choice, I think, was a death marriage to the reverend Charles\nWadsworth of the Arch Street Church in Philadelphia. He was happily married. She\nmet him about three times in her life. I would tell her story in 31 of her poems, one\nin two different settings, in my cycle “The White Election.”\nIt was completed in 1981, and broadcast on National Public Radio two years later. It\nseems to have made a good impression. Slava Rostropovich had kind words, and\ninvited me to write something for cello and orchestra that he could schedule on his\nupcoming tour in Russia. Placido Domingo invited me to write a song for him.\nRenata Scotto wanted me to choose five or so of the White Election songs that she\ncould include in her concerts. All were big opportunities. Somehow none happened.\nOther stuff was coming out the pipeline.\nThat included my opera “Plump Jack.” Here I would tell the rise and fall of Falstaff in\nShakespeare’s Henry the Fourth and Fifth. This was riskier. Now the\naccompaniment would be orchestra, not piano, and I had no background in\norchestration. Composing and orchestrating are not the same. Composing is like\nwriting a play, and orchestration is like casting the play. There are composers that\ndon’t orchestrate, and orchestrators who don’t compose. Most of us do both. I\nalways did my own orchestration because no one else would know what I wanted. I\ngradually learned from my mistakes. Now I can probably hold my own in\norchestration, although many do that better.\nPlump Jack was completed scene by scene over some twenty years. I would think it\nwas finished, and then decide it wasn’t. My next two operas, each running about an\nhour, would be composed much faster. I set “Usher House” to my earlier libretto\nbased on Poe’s story in about six weeks in 2008 and 2009. “The Canterville Ghost”,\non Wilde’s short story, took me about two weeks each, with two months between,\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 14\nfor libretto, composition and orchestration. The last two operas have been\npremiered at major opera houses. Usher House ran again at San Francisco Opera.\nUpcoming performance of the “scare pair”, meaning Usher and Canterville as a\ndouble bill, have been announced in other cities. Plump Jack is still waiting its turn.\nMy interest in human origins led me to the Leakey Foundation. I had read about\nLouis Leakey in the papers, and had met him a few times in Las Angeles and San\nFrancisco. Brilliant, courtly, fierce. He let you know what was wrong. I became a\nfellow in 1973, a trustee the next year and chairman the next.\nClark Howell, who taught anthropology at Berkeley, chaired our science committee.\nHis co-chair was Dave Hamburg, a Stanford psychology professor who specialized in\ngreat ape studies or primatology. Most leading scientists in either field were\nmembers or regular advisors. They recommended grants, and we trustees funded\nthem. We took a venture capital role, usually making grants of a few thousand\ndollars to promising new prospects rather than bigger amounts to steady-state\nprojects already proved. Those proved ones included Jane Goodall’s chimp studies at\nGombe or Richard Leakey’s digs at Lake Turkana. National Geographic, or the\nWenner Gren or World Wildlife or National Science Foundations tended to fund the\nknown winners. We’re a lot bigger now. I am one of the few living links to those\ngreat people and times. We’ve evolved with the science. But we stick to the venture\ncapital role.\nThat always left time to organize lectures and symposia. A few of us including Nancy\nPelosi, long before she tried politics, put together an all-star two-day symposium at\nthe Palace of Fine Arts in the San Francisco Marina district in 1973. Tickets sold out,\nand hundreds watched on screens set up in the lobby. Julian Huxley regretted, but\nsent his good wishes on tape. The octogenarian Raymond Dart recounted his\ndiscovery of australopithecus africanus at Taung cave near Johannesburg in 1924.\nLouis Leakey had died the year before, but his equally legendary widow Mary\nupdated us on the digs at Olduvai. Dick Hay filled us in on the geology there. Jane\nGoodall gave the news from Gombe. Dave Hamburg reported on the new\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 15\nchimpanzee compound near the linear reaction at Stanford. Clark Howell briefed us\non his work at Torralba and Ambrona in Spain, where our ancestors half our size\nhad hunted elephants twice the size of modern ones. (Elephants go back at least as\nfar as mammoths and mastodons.) Desmond Clark covered African archaeology in\ngeneral and his discoveries at Kalambo Falls in particular. Sherry Washburn showed\nthe way in which our DNA is 98% the same as a chimp’s. All were my close friends.\nIt was at a symposium in 1974, in Washington I believe, that I first heard and met Irv\nDeVore. His talk was on evolutionary biology and Hamilton’s rule. Both were new to\nme. Irv was a champion speaker. Students packed his anthropology classes at\nHarvard. He became a Leakey stalwart and a particularly close friend.\nI liked his topic. Genes code for traits, and traits more adaptive to niche pressures\nare likelier to carry the genes that encode them into the next generation. The\nlikeliness is “fitness”. A beauty of this is that you can predict traits from the\nenvironment (niche), and the environment from traits. That promised the kind of\nlogical challenge that I loved.\nSurvival of the fittest was not news to us. What was news was that bright scientists\nlike Irv were specializing in that logic, and making testable predictions for creatures\ngenerally, humans included, rather than sticking to the groups they studied most.\nThat meant people I could talk to.\nHamilton’s rule was put up as the prime example. It starts from the principle that\nthe end game in biology is investment in the next generation. Hamilton had\nreasoned in 1965 that genes coding for most efficient investment in closest kin, who\nwere likeliest to carry copies of those genes, ought to leave most copies in the next\ngeneration. We would invest in them when consanguinity was greater than\ncost/benefit ratio measured in fitness given up and fitness gained at the other end.\nI didn’t like this. Something was missing. The logic was seductive. But Achilles does\novertake the tortoise. Traits compete, like those racers, for niche space. The winner\nis the fittest at meeting needs of the niche. Hamilton’s rule seemed to leave that out.\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 16\nIt got Darwinism backward. Darwin’s idea was that the best-adapted leave most\nprogeny, not that leaving most progeny or other close kin somehow bootstraps itself\ninto adaptiveness.\nThe math of Hamilton’s rule didn’t work either. In diploids like us, where each\nparent carries two sets of chromosomes, closest relatedness without inbreeding is\n½. That meant that fitness would have to double or more with each generation. The\nreason is that fitness not expected to be transmitted to successors would be a\ncontradiction in terms. If it cannot be transmitted (invested) at less than a 2:1\nefficiency ratio (benefit/cost ratio), then it must be expected to double or more with\neach reinvestment. But aardvarks and flatfish aren’t 1024 times fitter than their\nancestors of ten generations ago. They aren’t even a smidgen fitter, by any measure\nof fitness known to me, unless the population has grown. Population growth in\nnature usually fluctuates around zero.\nBut his rule was right in important ways. Nepotism is common in nature. The Trust\npassed my father’s wealth to direct descendants. Most wills do, or favor nephews\nand nieces as a secondary choice. Chimp mothers maneuver to push their offspring\nup the social ladder. Worker ants and bees, who don’t breed, push the chances of\ntheir younger half-sisters. Hamilton’s rule was clearly a good rule of thumb, even\nthough the math needed tuning. Why should it usually work? I couldn’t know then\nthat Hamilton himself would find the biggest missing piece of the puzzle in 1982.\nEconomics was always somewhere on my screen. It was the biggest challenge\nbecause I had to reinvent it from scratch. I had dropped the course at USF because I\ncouldn’t find the foundations. But we don’t build a foundation without knowing\nwhat we want to top. I had to reinvent everything at once. Does that mean I thought\nI was best qualified for such a task? No. Plenty of people are better at logic than I am.\nRather I seemed to be the only volunteer.\nExplicit economic axioms are seen as a nineteenth century thing. There are implicit\nones to a degree. Macroeconomics is said to rest on microeconomics, and\nmicroeconomics on the logic of supply and demand. Good so far. But I felt the need\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 17\nof a logical context for those. Too darned much was being taken for granted. What\ndo we really want from economics? As we gradually figure that out, we can figure\nout the most efficient vocabulary for description and prediction. That’s was what\nNewton did. I didn’t like the lazy assumption that those problems had already been\nsolved.\nNewton lucked out in that old words like mass, force and energy would mostly do if\nhe gave them exact definitions within their usual ranges of meanings. Brand new\nterms would have made tougher reading, and his Principia Mathematica was tough\nenough in 1687. I had the same luck in the end. But I didn’t know that until I had\ncollected textbooks and economic dictionaries, along with most books on economic\nhistory I could find, and meanwhile worked out what I thought the right vocabulary\nought to be. We pretty well have to solve every section of the jigsaw puzzle at the\nsame time. I’m my father’s son, by the way, and balked at the three-figures prices of\nsome of those textbooks, even though I might fork up as much for a bottle of wine.\nMy ideas on growth theory and capital theory (explaining rates of interest and\nreturn) will get plenty of coverage later. It happens I have also taken a lifelong\ninterest in banks and money theory. This book isn’t about that directly. But banks\nand money are part of the story of growth and interest, and anyhow are worth\nattention in themselves.\nMoney has been defined elegantly in terms of what we want from it. We want a\nmeasure of value and a medium of exchange. The qualities to give those things are\n“moneyness”. Money should be “transportable”, for one, in that we don’t really want\nto lug bags of wampum around. It should be stable in value, so that we can contract\nover the future with least uncertainty. It should have the same value in different\nplaces as well as at different times, to minimize the nuisance of conversion. There\nshould be enough of it that shortage doesn’t drive us to the clumsiness of barter. It\nshould be “divisible” into tiny units, as hundred-dollar bills into tens and ones and\npennies, for exact payment with nothing owed back. It should be fungible in that one\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 18\nunit, say dollar, is worth exactly the same as another. Most essential of all, money\nshould be something actually and reliably valued.\nWhat meets all these criteria? Gold has been a contender since ancient times. But\nhow reliable is its value? Spain and Portugal stockpiled gold and silver from the new\nworld for two centuries, and bought nothing but inflation for their trouble. Gold is\ngood for filling teeth, and for displaying status so long as it is rare. Then what is\nbetter?\nTwo brilliant and dangerous adventurers, the Scotsman John Law and the Irishman\nRichard Cantillon, proposed land. France in 1720 had no new world mines, and\nneeded money. It had plenty of land in Mississippi. Law and Cantillon put two and\ntwo together. I think they sincerely believed their advice to The Duke D’Orleans, the\nregent after the death of Louis XIV, that land could be the most reliable basis of\nvalue then known. More than that, I think they were probably right. But it wasn’t\nreliable enough. Early investors in paper rights to the land had made a mint as\nothers crowded in. Market euphoria led to more paper rights than underlying value.\nYou’ve heard that one before. Law and Cantillon saw the crash coming. It would be\ncalled the “Mississippi bubble”. Cantillon sold out just in time. Law preferred to face\nthe music, as I would in the Neutral Zone a quarter millennium later. Land wasn’t\nthe answer.\nI can’t call Law and Cantillon good guys like the emir. Both seem to have committed\nmurder for money, Law long before and Cantillon long after, in scandals in London\nhaving nothing to do with the bubble. But they had good days. Cantillon’s book,\nwhich I know only from descriptions by economic historians, seems to be a\nmasterpiece of the obvious-in-hindsight. Law went down with the ship, like a\nmensch, and seems to have kept the trust and friendship of many backers he had\nbankrupted. I mention the plusses of these two men to remind us that the truth is\nseldom black and white, and to mitigate the folly of the French in trusting them.\nMoney today, in the United States and elsewhere, is not backed by any commodity. It\nis “government fiat money” backed by the taxing power of government. That may be\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 19\nthe best solution tried so far. The value behind the taxing power is the total capital\nof the nation, meaning human as well as physical capital. And the dollar has proved\npretty stable since Paul Volker’s tough reforms in the early 1980s. That means that\ngovernment fiat money in this county is working about as well as anything we have\nknown.\nBut there are problems. Government tools for stabilizing government fiat money,\nwhich has no value in itself, are limited to control of its supply. The tools are\nmonetary and financial policy. Monetary policy is mostly “open market operations”\nwhere government sells bonds to soak up excess money, and buys them back again\nto put money back in the system. You can also raise or lower Central Bank interest\nrates to get the same effects. Fiscal policy trims money supply by raising taxes and\ncutting government expense, and pumps money back into people’s hands by\nlowering taxes and raising government expense. Monetary policy is the tool of\nchoice because it has acted must faster. But either policy, or any mix, is a tightrope\nwalk. Too much money courts inflation by motivating people to spend rather than\nsave. Too little courts recession by motivating the opposite. That’s why\nmacroeconomics is said to rest on microeconomics. Are we wise to push our luck on\nthat tightrope forever?\nAnother problem is that our current money system may depend too much on banks.\nBanks buy and sell back the government bonds, for example, and create the money\nthey lend by writing it into the borrower’s checking account and booking the\npromissory note as value received in return. The problem is that banks are failureprone.\nI mean plain commercial banks which do nothing but accept deposits and\nmake loans, not the still more dangerous commercial/investment hybrids which\nrose and fell after repeal of the Glass-Steagle Act.\nThe danger is leverage. Depositors must be attracted at some cost, say checking\nservices. Borrowers must be attracted at a rate covering those costs to give profit in\nthe first place. Then equity investors must be attracted at an equity rate, generally\nhigher because equity imposes risk. These rates and costs are market givens rather\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 20\nthan what the bank decides. Then how can profit from lending rates, watered down\nby costs of attracting depositors, translate into higher equity rates?\nEasily, but dangerously. That’s where the leverage comes in. If the amount borrowed\nis much larger than the amount invested as equity, absolute profit from borrowing\nmight be large compared to the amount invested. If hens lay only one egg per day,\nbut I own three hens, then I can eat three eggs a day.\nMore money lent out, compared to equity invested, presupposes more deposits to\nlend. The leverage needed, or deposits/equity ratio in the bank’s case, works out to\nequal the market equity return for investments of equal risk, divided by the market\nborrowing rate for loans of such term and risk, net of expense percent including\ncosts of attracting depositors. This has tended to pencil out at about ten to one.\nFirms in general are considered risky when leverage (debt/equity in that case)\nreaches one to one. Four to six is more typical. Not ten to one. Banks invest in loans,\nwhich are safer. But not ten times safer. Few people today would risk their money in\nbank deposits without federal deposit insurance. My own reading of history finds\nthat deposit-and-lend banks have failed systemically, or needed bailouts, about once\nper generation since they were innovated in Marco Polo’s time. They failed because\nborrowers default in high winds, and defaults are magnified tenfold in effects on\nstockholders’ investment. We rebuilt them, and the tenfold leverage, because we\nblamed the high winds rather than the rickety structure. The Practical Pig knew\nbetter.\nIt began occurring to me in the mid 90s that mutual funds might replace bank\ndeposits, and deal with the tightrope problem too. Too much money burns holes in\npockets today because money earns nothing while we hold it. Mutual funds pay\nreturns, and are owned for their own sake. If their shares were somehow money,\npeople would feel no impatience to spend it, and no supply would be too much. I\ngradually figured out how the obvious problems in fungibility and divisibility and\nother moneyness qualities could be addressed.\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 21\nNobelist Franco Modigliani heard of this, and invited me to MIT for a presentation.\nHe talked like Gepetto in Disney’s “Pinocchio”. There were a few other top brains,\nincluding Ruddiger Dornbusch and2Julio Rotemburg, in the small classroom where I\nspoke. Sometimes Modigliani interrupted. “Getty, you don’ta consider this.” “You\nforgeta that.” I guess I thought I wasn’t doing so well.\nMy talk ended, and he and I were standing by a window. To lighten the mood, I said\nsomething about the Red Sox. He said “Getty, I getta papers on banka reform every\nweek. Yours isa the best.”\nMilton Friedman, another nobelist, had a different take. We had given talks at a Cato\nFoundation symposium in San Francisco. He hated my idea. No great surprise. He\nhad written that money ought to earn nothing so that we wouldn’t own too much.\nAny attempt to back money with anything, he told me, would meet John Law’s fate\nin the Mississippi bubble. The backing commodity would become inflated and then\ncrash. So Nobelists can disagree.\nMy version of the same idea today looks first to ETFs (exchange traded funds),\nwhich are more liquid and money-like than mutual funds. ETFs are usually index\nfunds, which replicate index holdings with no active management and so charge\nvery small expense ratios. But mutual funds might become money too. My idea, dead\nopposite from Friedman’s, is that both money supply and money yield should be\nheld as high as possible.\nWhat would happen to banks? Major angst, but not much damage. They would\ndevolve into their separate deposit and lending specialties, with separate\nstockholders and only incidental interaction. Deposits would be invested in ETFs or\nmutual funds. Federal deposit insurance would wither away as unneeded. There are\nno runs on ETFs. Lending banks would have to raise funds to lend from investors\nexpecting a return.\nIs there a downside? There is certainly a risk of one. The devil we don’t know is\nwhat would happen to lending rates and what the consequences might be. That had\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 22\nbeen one of Modigliani’s points in his interruptions. Federal deposit insurance\nsubsidizes cheap money and keeps lending rates low. Most tradition associates easy\nmoney with growth and prosperity. Higher interest rates are associated with\nrestraint in investment and consumption both. Modigliani was right to worry.\nMy guess is that the bank reform and money reform I propose would drive\nborrowing costs up, borrowing volume down, and equity investment up to fill the\ngap. Corporations would issue new stock to retire corporate debt. Newlyweds\nwould rent, not buy, until their incomes were high enough to bring other options.\nModigliani was also worried that monetary policy would become impossible. It\nwould as we know it. I have argued elsewhere that fiscal policy can be made to work\nas well and as fast. And I will argue for an unusual and more direct form of monetary\npolicy. But no one knows.\nThese concerns are reasons to go slow. I think that the reforms I describe are\ndeveloping now, with no input from me, and will continue if they succeed.\nDepositors will be attracted away from banks to ETF accounts of equal liquidity and\nfull return. Federal deposit insurance will not be advantage enough to hold them.\nBanks will get the message and join the parade by spinning off their loan\ndepartments and investing deposits in ETFs. If Modigliani’s valid concerns haven’t\nfound good answers, the parade will stop until they do. It could backtrack to the\nstarting point. The reforms I believe in ought to work, but can be scrubbed without\nmuch mess if they don’t.\nI am not their only advocate. Others argue for splitting up commercial banks more\nor less as I would. Meanwhile many people maintain liquidity in ETFs or mutual\nfunds rather than banks. There may be some originality in putting the two reforms\ntogether.\nThis personal account can end with more thoughts about my father. My stepmother\nTeddy’s touching book about their marriage, out a couple of years ago, tells the truth,\nthe whole truth and nothing but the truth. That what she does. He seems not to have\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 23\nbeen the easiest guy to be married to. He pinched pennies, went on trips while she\nheld up the home front, came home late. My mother had about the same story. But I\nsaw different sides of him at different times and places.\nTwice I saw him cry. Once we were listening to a Caruso record. He might well have\nheard Caruso, although I don’t recall that he said so. He would already have been 28\nwhen Caruso last sang at the Met. One of the two books he wrote by himself shows\nhim as an opera buff when on his own in Germany in the 1930s. He wrote what\noperas he had heard, who sang, and what he liked. My mother said the same. Once\nthey arrived late at a performance of La Boheme somewhere on the Riviera, couldn’t\nfind a program, liked the tenor, decided to help him, and learned that they had failed\nto recognize Beniamino Gigli.\nThe other time was about his and Teddy’s son Timmy. Timmy’s brain tumor was\ninoperable and growing. He was 13. The doctors had told them to prepare for the\nworst. We were in London. The papers said something about young toughs called\nTeddy boys. My father started crying. Timmy wouldn’t make it, and the Teddy boys\nwould.\nI’ve now lost a son myself. You thank the graces for what’s left to do. What’s left to\ndo includes composing, verse and economics. The first has panned out okay. A fair\nbit of the verse was set in the music. At least that makes it read and heard. Aside\nfrom the kind words of Modigliani and a few others, I can’t say as much for my\neconomics. So here goes again.\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 24\nCHAPTER 2: FAST FORWARD\nI dropped the course on economics because I couldn’t see the foundations. Not that\nthey should be clear from the start. That isn’t how the mind works. We see, do and\nunderstand in that order. The pyramids rose four thousand years before people like\nGalileo and Newton found the laws that made them possible. Practice comes first,\nand science last. Science is abstraction from the particular to the general. It is fewer\nrules predicting more outcomes more exactly. The pyramid builders knew rules for\nthis kind of stone and that kind of wood or rope. Newton gave rules for mass and\nforce. Those are not particular things like stone and wood and rope. They are\nqualities of all things. Their rules are tougher to get our minds around, but predict\neverywhere once we do.\nWhat a book or course should offer from the start, even before the foundations, is an\ninkling that it should be worth finishing. We have to sense that we’re on to\nsomething. The price of getting there will be the nuisance of abstraction from things\nto qualities, and we need to see a reason to pay it. I didn’t in the course on\neconomics. Now it’s my turn. I’ll try a fast forward through free growth theory and\nmy other arguments to give an idea where we’re headed and why it matters. The\nfoundations and then the slower tour will follow.\nFree Growth\nWhat I call free growth theory will probably count as the chief surprise, at least to\nnon-economists, because the argument and the supporting evidence call for a major\nreversal in tax policy of this and other nations. But it is not original. John Stuart Mill\nwrote the same idea in his Principles of Political Economy in 1848. I will quote what\nhe said in my Chapter 4. Although Principles became a leading textbook for decades,\nthe paragraph I quote seems to have been overlooked. Economic historians\nincluding Joseph Schumpeter describe him as a champion of growth through belttightening.\nThe paragraph I will quote makes the opposite clear. We now have\nmeans to prove his idea. I will show how to test it, and will show test results in\ncharts and tables taking up about 20% of this book. They imply that tax laws\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 1\nencouraging investment over consumption and plowback over dividends,\nparticularly in the last half century, have led to dangerous overinvestment in the\nprivate sector. The empty eyesores and bulldozer bills of 2008 are symptoms of proinvestment\npolicies founded in many countries after World War II. They did no\nharm when the world needed rebuilding anyhow. But I suggest that output growth\nslowed because of them, not despite them, after 1970 or so. I will argue that optimal\ninvestment at the national scale, strange as it sounds, is depreciation plowback and\nnothing more. Mill showed how that could be true. The same growth will arrive, say\nhe and I and the charts and tables, with no consumption sacrificed. More\nconsumption at no cost to growth adds up to more output. Output nosed down\nsince 1970 or so because we squelched consumption to no purpose.\nThat means only private sector overinvestment, prompted by unwise tax motives,\nand only at the collective scale. Government follows different motives, and has\nsomehow followed them to an opposite problem in this country. Our infrastructure\nrusts and crumbles. It seems that our good friends in the Tea Party think that roads\nand bridges undercut market freedom.\nGrowth is interesting, even without these opposite distortions, because history is\ninteresting. Growth is our history. It is not the history of other creatures, who repeat\nnorms from generation to generation once evolved. That’s why the math of\nHamilton’s rule doesn’t work. And we care about it because there are emotional and\nmoral and belly issues attached. I gave an idea of its dangers in the foreword. The\npast has proved survivable. The future has not. Then what about its cost? Does\nfaster growth need consumption restraint at the start? Is it a reward for sacrifice?\nThat’s what Mill tried to answer in 1848.\nHe started with the idea that output, meaning creation of capital, must mean growth\nof capital (“investment”) plus consumption. I will call this the Y = I+C (or Y = C+I )\nequation from the standard notation economists use. I will argue that it is true with\ntwo adjustments. Investment must include investment in human capital, and\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 2\nconsumption must exclude any schooling or nurture already counted in that\ninvestment. (Schooling counts as consumption.) Mill would have understood the\nhuman capital concept, defined by Sir William Petty nearly two centuries before, but\neconomists only recently have begun to take it seriously. Mill’s meaning of the\nY = C + I equation, and the one accepted everywhere in macroeconomics even today,\nleaves out the growth in human capital and includes all consumption.\nThat equation, which I will try to prove correct if we make the two adjustments,\nshows that less consumption brings faster growth if output holds still. But nothing\nin the equation says it will. It says that less consumption means either more growth\nor less output. It doesn’t say which. John Maynard Keynes, probably the most\nfamous and influential economist of the 20 th century, put this fact of math a special\nway in his General Theory of 1936. In his analysis, saving through less consumption\nis either invested or not. Since output is consumption plus investment, saving\nuninvested is so much less output. I like to put the same idea with a range of degrees.\nAll saving is invested, as I use the word, but finds different returns. Saving under the\nmattress is investment at zero return, and drops output just as Keynes said.\nInvestment at the current average return keeps output unchanged. That’s what\nKeynes meant. But investment at lower returns lowers output, and conversely.\nKeynes’ version sees intended saving (consumption restraint) as either invested or\nnot, and sees it as translated dollar for dollar into actual capital growth if it is. Mine\nallows any degree of capital growth below or above the actual cost of investment in\nconsumption given up.\nThis is a surprising concept, either in Keynes’ version or mine, because it seems to\nfight personal experience. Until the next raise or job change or layoff, our incomes\nseem to be known quantities. If we skip desert, and watch TV instead of going to the\nmovies, we can put more in the bank. At least our incomes will not drop because we\nsaved those costs. But it is different for all of us collectively. When the whole nation\nsaves, and either does not invest or invests less productively, output drops. Keynes’\nanalysis says the same, but leaves out the “less productively”.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 3\nMy reading of the Mill paragraph says that if we plowed back only depreciation\ninvestment, without invading consumption for more, we would still grow if that\ninvestment paid off in higher returns than the current norm. Then capital would\ngrow faster without making consumption grow slower. The gain in output, even\nthough we had invested only enough to make up for depreciation while keeping\nconsumption the same, would have been split into some for capital growth and\nsome for more consumption. And Mill gave the reason for the gain in output. The\ndriver was “whatever increases the productive power of labor”. He was talking\nabout better ideas. We would make returns higher if we could make capital more\nproductive at the same cost.\nThis possibility troubled Nobelist Robert Solow, who came reluctantly to a\nconclusion most of the way toward Mill’s a century later. He felt that growth should\nnot be a gratuitous deux ex machina arriving at its own whim. How could Mother\nNature say “Shazam” and turn less into more whenever new ideas come along?\nDidn’t the capital chicken have to grow before the output egg? Didn’t we have to\ntighten belts to invest in new plant applying those new ideas? But the evidence\nseemed to say that the rise in output came first. Rise in capital followed. Thrift\nseemed to play little role. Tests by others have tended to find the same thing since.\nMy own tests, using new data from national accounts and my own new testing\nmethod shown in my charts and tables, reduces the role of thrift to zero. How could\nthat be?\nHow could better kinds of capital arrive without costing more, at least at the start,\nthan the kinds we already knew? My best guess is that the cost of innovation in\nfailure rates and learning curves is the cost of being human, that we pay it about the\nsame every day, and that growth happens when the worth of innovation proves\nmore than the cost. It can because we are human. The cost of being human means\nthe cost of adapting. It is how we cope. We turned in our fangs and fur in exchange\nfor the savvy to make tools and fire and clothing do better. Other creatures adapt\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 4\ntoo, but we became the specialists. Adaptation grades into innovation whenever it\nsomehow becomes a norm. That too happens with other creatures, but not as often\nor as lastingly. Their new norms almost always revert to the old ones. Our\ninnovations collect and accrue. That’s why growth is our history.\nIts costs are failure rates and learning curves. Many innovations are blind alleys, and\nmost others need shakedown runs. But we’re stuck with those as the cost of being\nhuman. And we’re stuck with them whether the result right now is growth or not.\nThey were our cost of survival during our million years as homo erectus, when the\narcheological record shows little overall change in the stone tools we made. Growth\nand lasting innovation picked up marginally with the emergence of Ancestral Eve\nand bigger brains about 200,000 years ago, and began accelerating about 50,000\nyears ago. Growth happened because the more or less constant cost of adaptation\nand innovation became less than the payoff. New ideas finally found traction at no\nadded cost. Mill’s idea was that more payoff in growth need not presuppose more\nsacrifce.\nDoes that mean that all we need for growth is new ideas and the courage to trust\nthem? Well, no. We still have to plow back depreciation as the cost of holding even.\nWe need practical savvy and patience too. Sometimes great new ideas must wait for\nan opening. That may be why our bigger brains showed little effect on the kinds of\ntools we made until about 50,000 years ago. And I will argue that innovations need\nlaws and customs that welcome them. Otherwise they will make a few bucks for the\nlocal warlord rather than wealth for the originator and the world. But what they\ndon’t need, say Mill and I and the data, is tighter belts.\nAdam Smith, in his Wealth of Nations published in 1776, proposed growth by belt\ntightening. Most tradition has agreed, with the proviso that new ideas must come\nfirst. Solow raised doubts about the role of consumption restraint, but stopped short\nof denying a need for it. Mill acknowledged both ways to grow. My charts and tables\nwill confirm that only the kind that troubled Solow has actually happened, in every\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 5\ncountry and period tested. I call it free growth. My own free growth theory\nacknowledges growth by consumption restraint, which I call thrift, only as a\nmathematical possibility which doesn’t seem to happen. So my idea, taking account\nof data Mill didn’t have, is different from his. I must be careful not to put my ideas in\nhis mouth. When I say “Mill’s idea”, from now on, I will mean some of both.\nNo one had the data to prove him right until national accounts began reporting\nmarket-valued capital in 1990 or so, and reconstructing it for a few decades before.\nWhat they had earlier was the book measures of capital that we see in balance\nsheets. They don’t reveal enough. Book measures assume depreciation norms.\nOutcomes converge to norms over time, but meanwhile might be anything. National\naccounts follow a form of this book or depreciation accounting. They now report\nmarket-valued capital too, but still prefer book methods to calculate investment I\nand output Y in the Y = C + I equation. That doesn’t work well. Did you know that\nnational accounts in France, Germany, U.K. and the United States all reported\npositive net investment in the crash years 1929, 1930, 1937 and 2008? Net\ninvestment, meaning net of depreciation, is intended to show growth in capital value.\nDo you think values really went up in those crash years? And national accounts can\nbe just as wrong in the opposite direction. In the boom year 1933, when stock\nmarkets were up 42%, 67%, 96% and 46% in those four countries, Germany and U.S.\nreported net investment (capital growth) as negative while France and U.K.\nreported it up less than half a percent. All this shows in my charts and tables.\nReports of net investment in national accounts tend to prove radically wrong in\nyears of unexpected upturn or downturn because they don’t get the news of wars or\nnational disasters or discoveries or business cycles until new assets are bought or\nnew products sold. Purchases and sales are normally the only input into the books.\nAverage time between original purchase and realization in sales is the “holding\nperiod” or “turnover period” of capital. For all physical capital together, it runs\nseveral years. Accounts in those slump years were reporting the good news of boom\nyears shortly before, including the booms of 1935 as well as 1933 preceding the\nslump year 1937. Accounts in the boom year 1933 were finally getting the news of\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 6\nthe crash. (Yes, some of the strongest boom years in history came during the world\ndepression.)\nThis is not to question the need for national accounts. We could not manage without\nthem. But the genius of accountancy is in its reporting of cash flow items.\nDepreciation, even its sophisticated form used in national accounts, is a makeshift\napproximation better than nothing. I argue that it is obsoleted by our access to\nmarket-valued capital appearing in the last few decades.\nMill’s argument was that capital growth might be explained by productivity gain as\nwell as by thrift in deferred consumption. The way to test between them that I will\ndescribe takes measurements of market-valued capital, its year-to-year change in\nthese, and consumption at the same time. I call it the simultaneous rates method. In\nany year and country where consumption restraint explains growth, although the\ndata show none, rise in growth rate would equal current drop in consumption rate\n(consumption/capital) while rate of return (output/capital) holds unchanged. When\nproductivity gain is the explanation, as the data confirm so far, it is consumption\nrate that holds the same while growth rate and return rise equally. That’s what I\ntest. Data in charts and tables for those four nations from 1870 through 2010, and\nfrom Australia, Canada, Italy and Japan from 1970 through 2010, show that faster\ncapital growth coincides with higher consumption rates in the same year as often as\nnot. Less consumption has simply meant less output with no growth to show for it.\nThat is the sense in which growth is free.\nThese countries and periods are not cherry-picked to support Mill’s idea. They are\nall I have found. My source for national accounts including market-valued capital\nwas the website of Thomas Piketty and Gabriel Zucman adjusting their data to\nuniform accounting standards and measuring them in 2010 currency units. It also\ncollects recent and past research by other economists modeling what national\naccounts, again including accounts of market-valued capital, would have shown in\nyears before they were founded in 1930 or so. Simon Kuznets, for example, who\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 7\nfounded the national accounts in the 1920s and reorganized them along Keynesian\nlines when the General Theory was published, reconstructed them back to 1870 for\nthe U.S. economy. Piketty and Zucman incorporate this research and others. They\nhave acted as editors only. As a layman, I would hardly be qualified to find and\ninterpret original sources. Even most economists might lack that specialty. I simply\ntrust Picketty and Zucman. They will have compounded misreadings and editors’\nbias in those sources by adding their own, and I will have added mine. They and I\nhave plenty. Editing is bias by definition. But we can’t do without it. We manage as\nbest we can.\nTo make sure, I also test Mill’s idea on stock market data from the same nations and\nperiods. Here my source was the Global Financial Data website marketed by\nBloomberg. Market cap corresponds to capital, dividend yield to consumption and\ntotal return to output. Charts and tables show free growth as essentially all of\ngrowth in stock markets too.\nNow try a first look at the charts and tables. The lollipop-shaped Greek letter ϕ\n(phi) is something I call the free growth index. It reads 1 in years when growth is\nexplained as Mill described, 0 in years when belt-tightening was the explanation,\nand something in between when there was both. The free growth index will be\nexplained in chapters 4 and 5. The charts can be messy, and the data jumps around.\nThere are spikes, both up and down, which tend to disappear in the charts which\nscreen out small absolute values of the denominator (capital acceleration). But the\nfree growth index clearly jumps around 1, not zero, both before or after the\nscreening. It is as often above 1 as below. That means that growth is as likely to\ncoincide with belt-loosening as belt-tightening. My free website\nFreeGrowth&OtherSurprises.org shows how everything was calculated.\nEconomists will not be as surprised as they might have been a century ago. Growth\ntheory since Solow’s revolutionary papers in 1956 and 1957 has marginalized\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 8\ncapital accumulation or thrift, and has seen most growth at the national scale as\n“exogenous” or unexplained by whatever we suppose that we give up in exchange.\nThis book takes the next step in the same direction. The role of thrift is zero. It is\npoliticians, not economists, who will be flummoxed. The double tax and the tax\npreference for capital gains are examples of policies favoring investment over\nconsumption to benefit growth. The record shows no such benefit in any country\never. From all evidence so far, free growth theory is free growth fact.\nA New Way to Measure\nWhat this book tries to add is not only the next step in Solow’s direction. My\nsimultaneous rates method offers a new means of testing. Twentieth century growth\ntheory, led first by Keynes’ colleague Sir Roy Harrod and then by Solow, has tried to\ngauge the effectiveness of consumption restraint by a different method from Mill’s\nand mine. It has looked for effects on later output rather than on current capital\ngrowth. I call it the lagged flows method. Why the lag? Because if output is growth of\nwealth (capital) plus consumption, a shift from the third to the second cannot\nchange output at the same time. Rather output should benefit after a lag of a few\nyears for the capital that produces it to accumulate. Capital investment plants a tree,\nand output growth is the new fruit expected to follow.\nThe lagged flow method makes sense, and there was nothing better until data for\nmarket-valued capital began appearing in 1990 or so. But the lag tends to blur\ncausality. Later changes in output could have later causes. And output itself, after\nthe lag, could not be measured reliably for lack of the same data. It has been\nmeasured as gross or net domestic product, reported as the sum of consumption\nand book investment. Books don’t get the news until new assets are bought or new\nproducts sold. We just saw the anomalous book results reported for 1929, 1930,\n1933 (the opposite distortion), 1937 and 2008. Those are not the only examples. My\nmethod measures output as consumption plus change in market-valued capital. It\nseems to me that Piketty and Zucman ought to have shown output this way, at least\nas an alternative version. Isn’t it inconsistent to measure capital at market, but to\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 9\nmeasure its change (net investment) at book? And isn’t it better to measure the\neffectiveness of thrift with neither the lag nor the well-known problems of book\ndepreciation?\nI will show the math of my simultaneous rates method in Chapters 4 and 5. Chapter\n4 reasons from the Y = C + I equation, even though I don’t accept it, while Chapter 5\ntranslates findings into the new version I do accept. Charts and tables show both\nversions for all eight countries reported, over all years reported, and run the\naverages. The thrift index, or ratio of the supposed cost to actual growth, averages\nzero. I found it best to show separate charts for each country by each of the two\nversions of the Y = C + I equation and by each of three levels of denominatorscreening\n(none, then two progressively wider screens). Other charts track other\ndata that seemed informative. That explains why charts take up so much of this\nbook.\nThis completes my first survey of free growth theory and its support in the data.\nChapters 4 and 5 will cover the same ground again from new perspectives. So it will\nbe with other themes of this book and other chapters. My problem is to sell\nunfamiliar ideas, although not necessarily new ones, and in somewhat unfamiliar\nlanguage too. My “simultaneous rates method”, yet to be clarified, is an example. I\nuse the standard language of economics where I can, but must sometimes tweak\nwords or coin them. We will see that in Chapter 3. I try to cope with that double\nchallenge – unusual ideas in unusual terms – by the same strategy of restatement\nfrom new perspectives until all fits together.\nFixing the Y = I + C Equation\nIf I had any sense, I would pretend to accept the Y = I + C equation as Mill and all\nother economists seem to do. Then I could have done with only half as many charts,\nand made this a book about free growth only. Any fool knows that a book should\npick a focus. The data confirming Mill’s idea would have made a spectacular finale.\nWhy undermine my own case by questioning his assumptions? So I should probably\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 10\nhave played dumb and quit ahead. But that would have left out half the story and all\nthe other surprises. I confessed that the surprises are the features I can’t resist. If\nthey are fun for me, I can accept the challenge of making them fun for the reader.\nAnyway, I already opened that can of worms by showing that I don’t accept the\nY = I + C equation even though others do. I gave an idea why, and can sketch my\nreason out a little farther.\nIt begins with something I call the total return rule or total return truism. The\ntruism is that creation of value equals growth of value plus cash flow, where cash\nflow means value taken out less value inserted from outside. I don’t think anyone\ndoubts this truism, which is fundamental everywhere every day in the investment\nworld. I will prove it anyhow, just for good measure, in the next chapter. It is\nprobably the reason that the Y = C + I equation is readily accepted. Net investment I\nis meant to show physical capital growth. It could look to be the growth in value, if\nwe don’t consider human capital, and consumption C could look to be the value\ntaken out.\nBut a second look is needed. The logic doesn’t work unless we consider all value\nincluding human capital. Some consumption is invested in human capital, and only\nthe rest exits the whole economy in satisfying tastes. Then the equation would still\nbe true if the invested part of consumption equaled human capital growth.\nThe reason why it doesn’t starts with what we already know about human capital.\nPetty in 1664 had hit on the idea of this as time-discounted future lifetime pay.\nAdam Smith in 1776 saw it equivalently as accumulated past investment in nurture\nand schooling. The Americans Irving Fisher and Frank Knight revived both ideas in\nthe early 20 th century. The tempo picked up after World War II at the University of\nChicago. Jacob Mincer rederived Fisher’s present value equation in 1958, and\nmodeled investment in human capital through job training. Nobelists Theodore\nSchultz and Gary Becker soon joined in. New insights included the realization that\nhuman capital grows from the self-invested work of learning, as well as the outside\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 11\ninput of nurture and schooling, and then depreciates gradually to zero just as\nbuildings do. Yoram Ben-Porath combined these ideas and more in a masterly lifecycle\nmodel published in 1967. We’ll get to it soon.\nSchultz called the part of consumption exhausted in taste satisfaction “pure\nconsumption”. The part invested in human capital was “pure investment”. I change\nthat to “invested consumption” to avoid confusion with investment in physical\ncapital. Since there is no settled term for the part of work invested in learning, I call\nit “self-invested work”. I call the part of work sold for pay “realized work”. Then the\nconsensus view formed in the 1960s held that human capital growth equals\ninvested consumption plus self-invested work less human depreciation. I agree,\nwith a clarification as to possible deadweight loss that I’ll come to in Chapter 6. I call\nit the Ben-Porath equation, although he drew it from the Schultz-led consensus. It is\nreally a summary of the first four of the equations in his 1967 paper taken together.\nThis explains my critique of the Y = I + C equation. The equation would be true if\nhuman capital growth equaled invested consumption. In fact it equals that plus selfinvested\nwork less human depreciation. The corrected equation would read “output\nequals consumption plus investment plus self-invested work less human\ndepreciation”. I call this the “Y rule”.\nUpending the Y = I + C equation is big news. Macroeconomics and the national\naccounts are founded on it. That’s one reason, although not the main one, why I\nthink that macroeconomics should start over. It doesn’t follow that national\naccounts in themselves need much change, aside from reporting net investment at\nmarket as well as at book, because accountants must measure what they can.\nHuman depreciation and self-invested work elude market measurement. But\neconomists can allow for them, and they are huge flows. Human depreciation is\ndepreciation of the larger factor. And self-invested work includes more than\nlearning. Ben-Porath showed, as we will see, that it equals all growth in human\ncapital not explained by inflows of nurture and schooling less outflows in human\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 12\ndepreciation. That implies that it includes all free growth of the larger factor. And\nthese huge flows would figure to be uncorrelated. Depreciation of either factor is a\nsteady drag on growth, while free growth is revealed in the charts and tables as a\nbucking bronco which might be double-digit positive one year and double-digit\nnegative the next. No wonder that national accounts cannot reliably tell good years\nfrom bad.\nAnother distortion in the Y = I+C equation is the undue prominence given to\nconsumption. Physical capital, in most views including mine, is only a third to a fifth\nof total including human capital. Human capital is the lion’s share. Pure\nconsumption is most of consumption, in my view, but not all of consumption. If the\nfactors grow in mutual proportion, then, the ratio of total capital growth to pure\nconsumption will be much higher than of net investment to all of consumption. That\nexplains, I think, why national accounts have reported not a single year of negative\nnet product in any of the eight countries since inception. Balanced portfolios report\nnegative total returns every few years. So would net product, were it not dominated\nartificially by the steady positive of consumption. It is as if a portfolio dominated by\ninvestment grade bonds were taken as representative of a realistically balanced\nportfolio.\nSolving the Age-Wage Puzzle\nI will now try to solve a feature that troubled Ben-Porath and has troubled many\neconomists since. I call it the age-wage puzzle. Age-wage profiles are published\nreports comparing pay earned by all working ages at the same time. Since all\ncohorts (same-age sets) are compared at once, as in a family portrait, age-wage\nprofiles do not show effects of technological growth over time. They show effects of\nage and experience alone. What appears is that pay or wage rises steadily until\nretirement or near it. Meanwhile human capital is present value of remaining\nlifetime pay, and shrinks steadily as approaching retirement and mortality leaves\nfewer future paydays to discount. Most students of human capital including Ben-\nPorath reason that self-investment must end when time left for recovery in higher\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 13\nfuture pay runs out. So do I. The puzzle is how pay could rise while human capital\nshrinks smoothly to zero.\nThis would not be a puzzle if we were speaking of oil wells whose oil might continue\nto be pumped out at a steady or even rising rate until the well ran dry. We are\npuzzled because pay is generally believed to equal and compensate work. Work\nmeans the output of human capital. How could less capital steadily produce more\noutput, meaning creation as distinct from depletion of value, particularly if some\nwork is self-invested rather than marketed for pay? That would imply exponentially\nrising productivity, meaning rate of return, and rising to infinity at the end.\nThink about it. Strictly speaking, human capital is present value of future pay less\nspending on future childhood nurture plus textbooks or tuition or job training\n(collectively called “schooling” by Mincer) invested in human capital. Ben-Porath\nknew that, as had others before, but reasoned that investment in anything must stop\nwhen not enough time remains for recovery. I think so too. And I argue anyhow,\nfrom observation rather than logic, that invested nurture and schooling\nsubstantially end when we enter the full-time job market sometime in our twenties.\nThen human capital in adulthood is essentially present value of expected pay, or\neven less if Ben-Porath and I are wrong and nurture or schooling continues to the\nend. When only a year of pay is left ahead of us, human capital at most is timediscounted\npresent value of one year’s pay. When one day is left, it is at most\npresent value of one day’s pay. Yet age-wage profiles show pay (wage) holding level,\nor even rising, as human capital grades smoothly to zero. This is the famous agewage\npuzzle. I’ll flesh out the same thought experiment later in what I call the\nparable of the boss and her secretary.\nEconomists have recently proposed solutions which I see as farfetched. Possibilities\nthat human capital indeed grows more productive with age, or depreciates all at\nonce, seem implausible in each case and cannot begin to explain enough. I think\nBecker hinted at the answer in 1964. Becker pointed out that job training at the\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 14\nemployers’ expense is part of investment in human capital, and reasoned that\nemployers won’t pay it unless they expect eventual recovery with interest.\nWhat Becker stopped short of saying is that the same is true of any investment in\nanything by anyone. When we invest for our own benefit, we expect recovery by\nourselves. When we invest for the sake of others, we expect recovery by them.\nRecovery means recovery of depreciation. Our parents would not have invested in\nour human capital without expected recovery of our human depreciation by us, and\nthe young further invest the work of learning in themselves because they expect\nthat to be recovered with interest as well.\nThere is another proof which I call the deadweight loss rule. Capital of any kind is\npresent value of cash flow, meaning expected realizations in transfer or taste\nsatisfaction. Deadweight loss means decapitalization with neither. It follows that\ndeadweight loss, although a common reality, is implicitly unexpected. But human\ndepreciation, like plant depreciation, is expected from first investment. That rules\nout deadweight loss, and makes human depreciation expected as cash flow by\nelimination of alternatives.\nEach proof is sufficient. The first expresses what I call the maximand rule: we\nmaximize risk-adjusted rate of return. Robert Turgot observed this in 1766. I’ll say\nmore about that in the next chapter. It takes little thought to realize that maximizing\nrisk-adjusted return begins with recovery of investment, and that this means\nrecovery of depreciation or amortization. We are depleted like the oil well, although\nwe create value too. The second proof needs only the assumption that human\ndepreciation is foreseen. It adds the specification that human depreciation is\nrealized in human cash flow. That turns out to mean that it is realized in pay. The\nsolution to the age-wage puzzle is that pay does not equal and compensate realized\nwork above. It compensates that plus human depreciation. I call this the “pay rule”.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 15\nThe pay rule joins free growth theory and the Y rule as the three major surprises\npromised in my title. Recovery of human depreciation in pay changes a lot of\nequations. It does not impact public policy and tax laws as radically as free growth\ntheory, but I will argue that it impacts them enough. Even if it didn’t, it is probably\nthe most startling assertion in this book from an economist’s viewpoint. And\nalthough I now know better than to claim originality for any idea in economics, this\none just might pass the test. If someone out there knows a precedent closer than\nBecker’s, as I eventually found ones for what I had thought were my own free\ngrowth and next generation theories, all the more fun in finding those unsuspected\nprecursors. (Next generation theory will be outlined soon.) And the two proofs\nleave no doubt. I will add a few more as we go. It is never overkill to drive another\nstake through the heart of entrenched misperception. Meanwhile we can already be\nas sure of that expected recovery, not actual recovery, as of anything we know. The\narguments from the maximand rule (Turgot’s insight) and the deadweight loss rule\nare unanswerable.\nAn analogy from something else we all know leads to the rest of my argument. Pay\nover working careers is something like payments over the period of a decliningbalance\nmortgage. Mortgage payments are partly amortization and partly interest.\nAmortization is like depreciation, although without the same sense of physical wear\nand tear behind it, and interest is like the worker’s output marketed to employers.\nThe declining balance is like human capital. Mortgage payments are almost all\ninterest at the start of the loan, when the declining balance is almost the whole loan\namount, and then gradually less interest and more amortization as the balance\nshrinks. As the balance approaches zero at the end, the payment approaches all\namortization while the interest share approaches zero.\nMy depreciation theory, which we’ll come to soon, argues that depreciation follows\nthe same logic and the same math. I will argue, in the face of what has seemed to be\ncontrary evidence, that depreciation of both factors begins at zero and grows\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 16\nexponentially to become all of cash flow at the end. This completes the explanation\nof age-wage profiles as we see them. Pay is all human depreciation at the end.\nWhat I Thought Once\nChapter 6 will compare accounting for human capital to accounting for a firm. Pay,\nin this analogy, is the worker’s revenue. The firm deducts outside operating costs of\nlabor and supplies to leave gross realized output. The analogy for human capital\nwould be maintenance consumption enabling life and activity. But I don’t deduct\nthis in reaching the workers’ gross realized output (gross realized work) because I\ntake it as part of the net output we intend in itself rather than a cost in return for\nwhat we intend. I see adult consumption as mainly Schultz’ pure consumption\nexhausted from the universe of capital, including human capital, in satisfying our\ntaste for adult survival.\nOpinion is divided here. Some economists have treated the maintenance\nconsumption that keeps workers going as new investment in human capital for the\nsake of higher pay in future. Some in the 18 th century expensed it, like maintenance\nin the firm, as a cost recovered in keeping up the worker’s revenue (pay) now,\nrather than invested for later. I did that for years. I now treat it as recovered neither\nin pay now nor pay later. Even though we couldn’t earn without it, I count it in pure\nconsumption exhausted in satisfying tastes for survival.\nWhen I thought it was recovered in pay and work products, up to about five years\nago, I realized that human depreciation could not also be. There would be nothing\nleft for pure consumption except Mill’s “unproductive consumption” neither\nreplacing nor maintaining human capital. That would stand biology on its head.\nBiology is precisely about replacing and maintaining us. Unproductive consumption,\nfor which there seem to be parallels in other species, is something biology has yet to\njustify. It cannot be the unique taste satisfaction that behavior reveals.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 17\nI found a solution that seemed to make sense then. It was the exact opposite of what\nI think now. If maintenance consumption were recovered in pay and work products,\nas I now think human depreciation but not maintenance consumption is, then\nhuman depreciation instead of maintenance consumption could be exhausted in\ntaste satisfaction! That seemed less macabre to me then. I looked for ways in which\nhuman depreciation, hardly the biological end in itself, could somehow be its\nmeasure. It was not unreasonable, I thought, to interpret human depreciation in\naging as the cost of survival. The old gag says that aging is not so bad when you\nthink about the alternative. Age-wage profiles could be explained, I thought then, as\nrecovery of maintenance consumption rather than of human depreciation in pay.\nAnd I had those precedents from the 18 th century. I knew that Francois Quesnay\nand the physiocrats, in Adam Smith’s time, had argued too that consumption could\nbe recovered in earnings. Mill could be interpreted that way, in his definition of\n“productive consumption”, as could Piero Sraffa in a paper from 1960. I thought I\nwas on the right track.\nWhat brought me to my senses was the thought experiment about a boss and her\nsecretary I mentioned earlier. Picture them together at the beginning of the last year\nof human capital for each. The boss earns ten times as much. Human capital for each\nis one year’s pay, or even less in the unlikely case that invested consumption\ncontinues to the end, less one year’s discount. If pay measured work, rate of return\n(work/human capital) would be something over 100% per year for each. It would\nbe even more in the unlikely case that some work remains unrealized (self-invested)\nuntil the end. Yet their time preferences measured by return to their other\ninvestments, say securities, is less than a tenth as much. This already states pretty\nclearly that pay covers more than work.\nIn case there was doubt, go on to the beginning of the last day. Age-wage profiles\nshow that pay for each is about what it was a year before. Rate of return to each is\nnow a little over 100% per day. At the beginning of the last second, it is a little over\n100% per second. At the end of the last second it is infinite. Yet the securities in their\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 18\nportfolios are chosen for returns no higher and riskier than the year before. They\nwill tend in fact to be lower, judging from logic and evidence for a decline in risk\ntolerance with age.\nThen what besides work is recovered in pay? The two possibilities I was weighing\nwere maintenance consumption and human depreciation. The winner was obvious.\nThe higher-paid usually consume more, but not always and not in proportion. The\nfact that we must generally be paid enough to cover consumption does not imply\nthat we are paid to consume. We are motivated to do that anyhow. We are paid to\napply skills, and are paid in proportion to skills applied. Human capital is skill sets.\nPay measures its transfer to products, whether in realized work currently created or\nfrom capital in place through human depreciation.\nThat’s how I came to the pay rule. We see why it ought to startle economists.\nMacroeconomic tradition teaches the doctrine that wage measures work, and\nteaches it so confidently that it uses the notation W for either. Human capital\ntradition recognizes that some work is self-invested, but effectively treats human\ndepreciation as deadweight loss. That’s why I use “pay” in place of the more usual\n“wage”.\nRefuting a Piketty Argument\nThere are practical uses for the pay rule aside from solution of the age-wage\nproblem. These are the impact on tax laws and public policy that I promised. Piketty\nhas shown correctly that the ratio of pay to net profit rose substantially during the\nworld wars, world depression and welfare state period following, and has declined\nsince. Piketty argues for higher capital taxes in consequence. His argument follows\ntradition in comparing pay and net profit as the shares of workers and investors in\nincome. But tradition is wrong. Pay is the worker’s gross realized income, meaning\ngross of human depreciation. Depreciation, for either factor, is a steadier flow. This\nmakes gross output for either less responsive to upturns and downturns. It is a\nparticularly high share of realized income or output in hard times when dislocation\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 19\nof both factors (human and physical capital) drives net output down. Comparison\nbetween net income and gross realized income can mislead. Piketty is right about\nthe data, but wrong about its interpretation.\nDepreciation Theory\nThis is the explanation I promised when I said that depreciation is essentially like\namortization. Accounting tends to practice straight-line depreciation over standard\ndepreciation periods. A well-known refinement, allowed but not much practiced in\nbusiness, is called current cost accounting. The idea is to correct distortions due to\npast inflation. The problem is that books reflect long-term assets and their\ndepreciation at original cost at date of booking. Current cost accounting adjusts both\nto the equivalent in current dollars. It shows both net worth and depreciation as\nhigher if prices inflated since booking, or lower if prices deflated. That seems to\nmake sense.\nA further adjustment called replacement cost accounting does the same, but also\nreplaces linear depreciation with a curve believed more realistic. National accounts\nadopt this method. It is sound in principle. But they shape the curve in the wrong\ndirection. They rely on records of actual sales of plant to model depreciation as\nsteep initially and slower later. I suggest that this record is misleading.\nMy starting point is that value of any capital is discounted cash flow. To keep things\nsimple at first, suppose that cash flow in constant dollars is expected to hold steady\nfor fifty years before asset life ends. Also suppose a constant time discount rate.\nPresent value at the outset is fifty years of discounted cash flow. At the beginning of\nthe second year, it is 49 years present value of the same cash flow at the same\ndiscount rate. All that has been lost is present value of the 50 th and most-discounted\nyear. At the start of the third year, capital has dropped again by present value of the\n49 th and second-most discounted year. So it continues until the end as the discount\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 20\nperiod approaches zero. Depreciation increases absolutely each year, and increases\neven faster in ratio to capital.\nWhat I have just modeled is depreciation rising exponentially from zero at the start\nto a maximum at the end. National accounts show the exact opposite. They show it\ndecreasing exponentially from a maximum at the start. The reason for the difference\nis instructive. I would rather trust the present value formula to show what assets\nare worth subjectively to their owners. The national accounts prefer to trust\nevidence as to what they are worth to others if sold. That’s a solid method too if the\nevidence is likely to prove representative. It isn’t in cases where transactions are\nmore likely to have been driven by pressure to sell than pressure to buy. Plant is\ngenerally tailored to purposes of its first owner, and not meant to be resold. Plant\nsales tend to follow disappointing results. These are likelier to come early as\nbusiness plans are first tested. That could explain why evidence without logic has\nsuggested that depreciation tends to start fast and slow down with time.\nI would recommend that national accounts continue tracking actual sales as an\nindicator of true depreciation curves, but limit the study to rental buildings\nexpected from the start to be resold several times. I mean apartment buildings,\noffice buildings and warehouses designed along standard lines. Many investors\nspecialize in buying and selling these tradable assets for portfolio purposes.\nPressure to buy and pressure to sell tend to balance.\nI can testify that prices bid for them are found either by discounted cash flow or\ninternal rate of return (IRR) methods. IRR is a variant of the same thing. A bid price\nis modeled as the original negative cash flow in evaluating the proposed purchase.\nThen the positive cash flows at each year’s end are modeled, and the discount rate\nfound which nets present value of all flows together to zero. If this rate is judged\ncompetitive, the purchase goes ahead. This method was originated by Keynes in the\nGeneral Theory as his “marginal product of capital”.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 21\nAnd I repeat that most other structures are not meant to be resold. Productive plant\nis customized to original owners. Tract housing is not, but becomes adapted to them.\nOriginal plant operators and homeowners typically expect to stay put. Most do.\nWhen they do, their own valuations are higher than would likely be realized in sale.\nOwners’ valuations matter. Economics is more than prediction of sales prices. It is\nprediction of behavior. It is the owner’s valuation of an asset, not a hypothetical\noutside valuation, that predicts what he will do to exploit and defend it.\nMy depreciation theory does not jolt settled belief as forcibly as free growth theory\nor the pay rule and Y rule do. It contradicts only a minor feature of the national\naccounts. But it contradicts that diametrically, and adds clarity to the pay rule too. It\nis also original as far as I know. Who has said such a thing before? All the more fun\nand satisfaction in finding out and setting the record straight. There are giants out\nthere, whether I ever make it to their shoulders or not, and economic history means\nidentifying them.\nRetirement Theory\nRetirement generally means the period or first moment when people end the\ncareers for which their training has been specialized. The reason is typically not\ndiminished skills and performance just yet, as age-wage profiles show no little or no\ndrop in pay toward the end. I think it is more that we and our bosses see the drop\ncoming.\nLiteral pay is typically zero in retirement. Instead we earn imputed pay for taking\ncare of ourselves and one another, and for driving the grandkids to the zoo. These\nservices are tangible, not psychic, in that they save the hire of others to do the same.\nThe imputed pay is what the others would have charged. But it typically is not\nenough to meet our consumption needs. Retirees must typically draw down savings\nor depend on “social transfer payments”, meaning support from government or\nfamily or foundations, to make ends meet.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 22\nIt seems that these infusions from savings or gift cannot be interpreted as invested\nconsumption to be recovered with interest later, but are rather pure consumption\nrecovered now in the satisfaction of survival. Then human cash flow, or pay less\ninvested consumption, remains positive to the end if we recognize imputed pay.\nEconomists should, I think, because it figures into predicting behavior as much as\nliteral pay. So does psychic pay.\nIt follows that human capital, meaning present value of all pay in the absence of\ninvested consumption to deduct, continues after retirement. That shows that my\nparable of the boss and her secretary is oversimplified. Parables tend to be. The\nsecretary may happen to have better skills as a full-time caregiver, which both she\nand the boss will figure to be in retirement, and so may reverse the disparity in\nhuman capital then. All models, I guess, assume ceteris paribus (other things equal).\nMy retirement theory leaves much unexplained. It tries to throw a little light here\nand there. I believe it achieves some surprise, and even originality until we know\nbetter, in my argument that human capital continues after retirement. Yet this\nfollows directly from Ben-Porath. Invested consumption must end when time for\nrecovery runs out, whether or not I am right in ending it with job entry decades\nbefore, and human capital must last as long as literal or imputed pay does. The\nendurance of human capital through to mortality is not logical certitude, but need\nnot be doubted either.\nRetouching the Ben-Porath Model\nBen-Porath’s life cycle model seems right enough in all features but one. Equations\nin his 1967 paper imply that pay measures realized work alone. This should be\nadjusted to show the pay rule. I would also model invested consumption as ending\nat independence, or a few months later to allow for initial job training. That does not\ncontradict Ben-Porath, who leaves such a possibility open. I would further apply\ndepreciation theory to model human depreciation as growing from a negligible\nshare of pay at first employment to substantially all of pay at the end.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 23\nMy model is the same as Ben-Porath’s from birth to independence. All consumption\nand all work are invested, for modeling purposes, until schooling ends at full-time\njob entry. I model this transition at age 20. Pay, realized work, human depreciation\nand pure consumption all begin at that point, although human depreciation begins\nat essentially zero.\nSelf-invested work continues as an important but diminishing share of work until\nlate in careers, just as in Ben-Porath. I differ from him mildly in that I model all adult\nconsumption as pure consumption. Ben-Porath allows adult invested consumption\nwithout assuming it. I regard it as real but negligible. Age-wage profiles are\nexplained by self-invested work and depreciation theory alone.\nI model this self-invested work as subliminal accumulation of job experience. My\nreason is personal observation. What I have seen in plants and offices is people\nworking full time on the job. We don’t take time off to learn. Experience simply\narrives, much as free growth does. I think that my view on this contradicts Ben-\nPorath’s marginally. He seems to allow some such allocation of time to help explain\nage-wage profiles.\nNext comes retirement. I model this as just shown. Later I will expand this model to\ninclude acquisition and disposal of physical capital too. The combined model will\ngive most of the math and mechanics of next generation theory.\nRisk Theory\nFor practical purposes, economic risk is usually measured as expected standard\ndeviation in rate of return. Safer assets vary less from their return norms. Shortterm\ntreasuries are thought safest because they combine fixed nominal return with\nfast liquidity in case inflation threatens. The market overall bids safer expected\noutputs up and riskier ones down. Since asset value is the denominator in rate of\nreturn, and output the numerator, the effect is make risker assets higher in return.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 24\nRisk tolerance might be anything in any individual. As a norm, it tends to be a\nfunction of age, gender and wealth. Effects of age and gender are better understood.\nTeens and young adults, particularly males, seem readiest to take chances. Prison\npopulations and medal of honor rolls feature young males. Part of the explanation, I\nthink, is biologist R. A. Fisher’s sex ratio theory of 1930, or equally Bob Trivers’\ndifferential investment theory of 1971. Young males show greatest variance in\nreproductive prospects. Females are almost always assured of a few offspring.\nYoung males might leave none or many. Nature arranges tournaments or displays to\ngive fitter males the advantage.\nAnother reason is that the young, of either sex, have most time left to outride\ndownswings. The older we get, the more risk-averse.\nSome businesses and assets are inherently riskier than others. Nerf balls are safer\nthan hand grenades. But I prefer to look past the asset owned to the owner. We tend\nto own assets suited to our risk preferences. And we tend to operate it as safely or\nriskily as we like. That is true particularly of human capital, although it was first\ndesigned according to our parents’ goals rather than ours. Human capital is\nprobably the most versatile asset, even so, and is adapted to our purposes rather\nthan theirs. We make it as risky as we choose. The risk-averse can become florists or\nTrappists. Risk lovers can try bullfighting or skydiving. What does that tell us about\nthe relative risk of the factors?\nHuman capital is owned disproportionately by the young. We own very little\nphysical capital, legally or in practical effect, until maturity. Pay at first is barely\nenough for survival. We accumulate it gradually as pay rises with age, and then\ndeplete it in provision for the young and in our own retirement. Since physical\ncapital is owned disproportionately by the older and more risk-averse, and human\ncapital the contrary, human capital figures to be higher on average in risk and return.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 25\nThere is another useful inference. Adults own assets in the business and housing\nsectors. Older adults tend more to own debt claims on these sectors, and younger\nadults to own equity claims. But all adult ages collectively own both sectors\ncollectively. It does not follow that the sectors are equal in risk, as older individuals\nmight tend to own one sector predominantly, and younger ones the other. As a\nlayman, I don’t really know.\nWhat I happen to know is that the publicly traded corporate sector, meaning stocks\nparticularly but also bonds, is far more liquid than the housing sector, and that the\nrest of the business sector is far less liquid than either. Risk in general includes\nliquidity risk. This leads me to the hypothesis or hunch that the housing sector in\ngeneral should be safer than the business sector, ceteris paribus, but that the\npublicly traded corporate sector, cap-weighting debt and equity claims on it, may be\nsafest of all.\nThe idea that stocks and bonds cap-weighted are safer than houses might have been\nlaughed to scorn a few years ago. It doesn’t seem so funny after 2008. I view it as an\nidea to be tested, not trusted, until more is known. If it holds up, it will rank as\nanother surprise.\nThe effect of individual wealth on risk tolerance is less understood. Here I judge\nmore from hunch and impression than from data. Given that human needs are fairly\nuniform, as with the private and the general, more wealth gives more insulation\nfrom want. Talent is wealth in human capital, and gives the same. Less, in either\nfactor, gives less margin for error. My hunch and impression is that the wealthier in\neither factor should tend to be more risk tolerant so long as human capital itself is\nnot put in harm’s way. Human capital operates physical capital, and gives the means\nof recovery. The wealthier, in talent or net worth, should prove the least tempted\ntoward sky diving and Russian roulette.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 26\nIn this book I will usually be modeling risk and return at the collective scale or at the\ncohort one. A cohort means the set of all same-aged individuals. It turns out that the\nratio of females to males tends to rise with each older cohort, for reasons Bob\nTrivers explains, as does wealth up to a point. But in cohort analysis, both effects\n(wealth and sex ratio) are incorporated into effects of cohort age. That will simplify\nmodeling.\nMy risk theory is another example of what looks to be surprise and novelty until\nshown otherwise. The unusual idea lies in projecting the owner’s time\npreference/return rate onto the asset rather than conversely. Thus all the owner’s\nassets of both factors are selected or modified to fit her current risk profile. This\nwould count her liquid securities portfolio, cap weighted, as a single asset. All other\nassets are too illiquid for practical rebalancing. We own the assets best suited to our\nrisk profiles, if for no better reason than that we wouldn’t be the winning bidders\nfor any others if we wanted them. As our risk profiles evolve with age, we modify or\ntrade them. We will tend to have anticipated this need, and to have factored\nmodification or trading costs into our bid price. It turns out that this interpretation\ncan simplify the math of present value and present cost.\nIt helps in supporting the pay rule, and explaining age-wage profiles, by rebutting a\nhypothesis, sometimes argued, that productivity of human capital might rise with\nage. Productivity, rate of return and time preference rate all mean the same. My risk\ntheory argues that we know a cohort’s risk tolerance from the return to its capweighted\nsecurities portfolio as a whole. All other assets of the same cohort,\nincluding human capital, will tend to agree with it in return. Return to security\nportfolios tends to be transparent. It declines with adult cohort age. I infer that\nreturn to human capital does the same.\nMy risk theory and depreciation theory together add a finishing touch to the pay\nrule. The key supporting evidence is age-wage profiles. Depreciation theory offers\nsolid logic, in the face of apparent contrary data, that pay is all human depreciation\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 27\nat the end. Risk theory reinforces that impression by adding that the contribution of\nproductivity in the form of realized work/human capital actually declines. One\ncannot pound too many stakes through the heart of the doctrine that pay\ncompensates realized work alone.\nNext Generation Theory\nI also treat rate of return. This combined free growth theory with insights of Petty\nin 1662 and William Stanley Jevons in 1871. Petty’s idea was that each generation\npasses the baton to the next. Our investment horizon is the generation length. Its\nreciprocal, or one over that period, gives our time preference rate. Jevons also saw\ntime preference as the reciprocal of the period of production, but did not connect\nthat to the generation length. I adjust Petty’s estimate of the length from his 21\nyears to 28.5 by allowing for later births as well as firstborns. The reciprocal is 3.5%\nper year. I add free growth as an exogenous and unspecified variable.\nAs with Mill and free growth theory, I have to walk a fine line between crediting\nPetty and putting my ideas in his mouth. Petty dictated his books and pamphlets,\nand is not always clear. My idea, probably but not certainly the same as his, is that\neach generation invests everything in the next in trust that it will do the same. All\nour capital of both factors, although Petty spoke only of a cornfield, is exhausted in\nputting the next generation in place. The time horizon to get this done is the\ngeneration length.\nThis 28.5 years, as I model it, becomes Jevons’ “period of production”. Its reciprocal,\nmeaning one over it, gives rate of return. The idea of a period of production whose\nreciprocal gave rate of return had begun with Rae in 1934, if you don’t count Petty,\nand passed through Nassau Senior to Jevons and Boehm Bawerk. All assumed\ngrowthlessness for simplicity. Return is growth rate plus cash flow rate. It simplifies\nto the pure consumption rate at the collective scale. All these men, even Petty, were\nreally modeling the pure consumption rate. 28.5 years gives the period of\nreplication, in my view, or period of production if there were no growth.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 28\nFree growth then arrives at its whim, like a deus ex machina, without calling for\nmore than this steady effort of replication. I find myself focusing more and more on\nthat cash flow component of rate of return, or pure consumption rate at the\ncollective scale, as the part we can predict and model.\nThe generation length is a biological norm which probably has not varied by more\nthan a factor of two since Ancestral Eve some 200,000 year ago. This suggests that\nnext generation theory can be tested against data from any period. Meanwhile it\npredicts only at the collective scale. Collective return is average risk return. Subtract\ncollective growth rate to leave cash flow rate. Return and growth are two of the\nmost closely measured rates in economics. That says that tests of next generation\ntheory should be practical. I will show tables broadly in support.\nNext generation theory is a blockbuster. An explanation of interest and return has\nbeen the Holy Grail of capital theory. Boehm Bawerk contributed a big advance by\nrevealing return as an artifact of time preference rather than the other way around.\nSome including Irving Fisher have seen that beautiful insight as enough.\nNot me. What explains and quantifies time preference? What turned out to be\nPetty’s idea occurred to me about 40 years ago, when I first took an interest in\nevolutionary biology. My friend Alan Rogers, a population geneticist I didn’t know\nall the time, was thinking in the same direction. His two published papers on this are\nin my appendix. Neither of us knew about Petty’s priority.\nThe idea would have been a still bigger blockbuster before the wall came down.\nWars were being fought about whether return has any legitimacy at all. Karl Marx,\nironically a champion of Petty, may have missed his argument on that.\nPetty’s idea is really the biological imperative I discussed in Chapter 1. The first\npriority is survival and reproduction. I will argue that this was implicitly accepted\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 29\nthroughout economic history until new insights now summarized as the marginalist\nrevolution began in 1871. The marginalists, mentioned in the forward, swapped the\ntelescope for the microscope. They left aside the grand teleologies of Smith and\nRicardo and Mill and Marx to refocus on the mechanics of choice. Reasons for tastes\nor choices were treated as irrelevant. By 1900 or so, the marginalists had given us\nmicroeconomics much as we know it today. A century would pass before\nbioeconomics took form in response to Hamilton’s rule.\nSummary\nThat gives the outline. It is a layman’s view of what a proper economist might not\nhave attempted. Fools rush in. I will cite sources in economics and biology not to\npretend that I am an authority, but to give real ones a chance to check. My case rests\non the charts and tables. Mill might have been astonished to find that the kind of\ngrowth he described is the only kind to appear in the record.\nWhat makes my book different, aside from my lack of credentials, is the surprises\nand the unusual degree of abstraction leading to them. Not many writers try to\nfollow a chain of inference as far without the comforting touch of the stone and\nwood and rope. If Becker had been as venturesome, he might well have solved the\nage-wage problem in 1964. I see no other path. Economics is all inside. It is tastes\nexpressed in choices. Capital is foreseen satisfactions discounted by whatever our\ntaste for impatience is. Most of it is human capital leaving little market record\nbeyond its rental cost in pay. Logic is about all we have left.\nBut the story cannot end in thin air. Few would pay the nuisance cost of so much\nabstraction without prospect of surprising and testable prediction. I will try to\ndeliver that. Mill’s idea is a surprise to politicians, if less so to economists, and could\nhardly be tested more thoroughly and successfully. When new ideas are thought up,\nMother Nature says “Shazam” and embodies them at no cost beyond the\ndepreciation plowback we needed anyway. The data could not be more supportive if\nMill and I had invented them. Even my proposed solution to the age-wage problem,\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 30\nwhich must have seemed hopelessly stuck in subjectivity, paid off finally in that\nsolution and in a refutation of Piketty’s argument. Risk theory and depreciation\ntheory, each surprising enough, reinforced that solution and the pay rule. I said\nnothing in the this chapter about bank reform because I covered that in Chapter 1.\nPredictions of behavior can work because tastes converge to market equilibria.\nWhat stands behind the convergence, I argue, is biology selecting tastes that\nmaintain and reproduce us. The idea that we act out the biological imperative is\nclear in Petty and Malthus, and in the equilibrium wage theory of Adam Smith and\nDavid Ricardo, where pay converges to the level preserving the work force. But if I\nsay everything about that now, I will have nothing to say later.\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 31\nCHAPTER 3: FOUNDATIONS\nHistorically, foundations and science itself emerge at the end of centuries of\npractical application. A logical place for foundations in textbooks is the beginning. So\nit was with Halliday and Resnick on physics, which began with Newton’s kinetics\n(motion in time and space) and then this three laws. Only in the last chapter did the\nauthors remind us that Einstein later put two of these three into question, and even\nthe kinetics. Halliday and Resnick reasoned, correctly I think, that we sometimes\nlearn more efficiently by learning something slightly wrong first and fixing it later. I\nwill do that, in a sense, by reasoning first through free growth theory as if the Y = C +\nI equation were true, and then again with the two corrections. The sometimes\ncounterintuitive logic of teaching and learning, including that, is “heuristics”.\nBuilding on explicit axioms was common in economics throughout the classical\nperiod running from Petty in the 17 th century through Mill in the 19th. Then came\nthe major shift in focus, beginning in 1871, called the marginalist revolution. What\nmattered was less our goals, and more the market mechanisms that aligned supply,\ndemand and price. The meeting point was the margin. Axioms about goals\ndisappeared, including the usual one of prioritizing survival and reproduction, and\naxioms kept were usually left implicit. The implicit ones, essential to marginalism in\nmy view, included convergent tastes and predictions. I will make those two and\nothers explicit, and eventually add back the goals.\nThis book on the whole is about second-guessing what is taught. This chapter is\ndifferent. The nearest thing to a surprise in it is the idea that economics needs\nexplicit foundations in the sense of axioms and basic definitions and equations. All\nthe ones I choose are well accepted. Why I pick which should seem obvious in\nhindsight. But some mini-surprises will accumulate. Why do I take such pains to\nprove every feature of what everyone accepts already? Why all the boilerplate and\nbulletproofing? I need them because I will later try to shoot down other beliefs\neveryone accepts. We must know what is sound to find what is not.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 1\nAnother mini-surprise is the physics-like care in definitions. The reason is that my\narguments later will drive logic pretty far. Logic needs words that are like algeraic\nsymbols in meaning the same thing all along.\nFiguratively and literally, foundations are groundwork. They will be less a chore if\nyou love logic. And you’d better if you’re going to like the later chapters. Let’s get\nstarted.\nOrientation\nEconomics itself, I think, is a quantitative rationale of choices. Psychology is a sister\nstudy not explicitly quantitative, and accounting for subliminal behavior as well as\ndeliberate choices. The two fields cooperate and overlap. Economics is quantitative\nin that it asks how much as well as what, and focuses on numbers. It is science-like\nin that it looks for surprising and testable predictions in the end. It is philosophylike\nin that choices are subjective and that the larger factor, human capital, leaves\nlittle market evidence from which to reason upward. Both facts put the burden on\nreasoning downward from axioms.\nMuch of the evidence for both factors, meaning physical and human capital, comes\nfrom the records of literal markets where we rent and hire and buy and sell. Most\neconomics looked no further until Gary Becker and others expanded the boundaries\nabout 50 years ago. The expansion made sense. A rationale of choices in literal\nmarkets alone is a silly concept. It is silly to acknowledge only choices that ring cash\nregisters. We are the same people everywhere. Logic is the same everywhere. We\nhave little interest in axioms that aren’t the same everywhere. Becker was right to\nsee choices in marriage and even crime as predictable in terms of supply and\ndemand and price.\nThat includes psychic price. Once we follow Becker past literal markets, we accept\npsychic value and yield. We must anyhow. Value is in the mind. Economics works as\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 2\na rationale of choices, hence values, because human nature leads minds to converge.\nThe literal market adds a measure. When we step outside it, we make do without the\nmeasure and trust logic alone.\nA Diamond Ring Parable\nI like a picture of a diamond ring to show something about psychic value and yield,\nand even about what output and exhaust in consumption are. The ring brings\npsychic yield to its wearer. If it didn’t, it would have no value. Its yield is each\npsychic satisfaction, and its value sums all time-discounted prospective ones\ntogether. Value therefore drops just a little as each yield is finally realized. It is as\nwith apples dropping from a tree. Yet the ring is inert. It ostensibly produces\nnothing. It also keeps all its value as a ring from day to day. Then where does the\noutflow of the value in the exhaust come from? How can value go out if none was\ndeducted and none produced? In the tree, we can see the apples growing and falling.\nThe answer is that some value was produced in the ring, and some deducted too.\nWhat we didn’t notice was the constant shortening of remaining discount periods.\nAs each day passes, each future yield comes one day closer. These are the apples\nslowly ripening on the tree. Present value of each rises because the discount period\ncovers less time. This creation of value is output by definition, even though nothing\nhas moved but the hands of the clock. As the discount period reaches zero, the\nexpected yield eventuates to explain the taste satisfaction. These yields are the\napples falling to be eaten. The ring holds its value intact because the exhaust of\nvalue it surrendered has exactly offset the output of replacement value as time alone\nshortens discount periods. Yet not an atom stirred.\nThe whole point is that the value of the ring or anything else is discounted present\nvalue of foreseen satisfactions. They are discounted because there is such a thing as\n“time preference”; we value satisfactions now over foreseen ones later. This is not\nquite the same as the difference between birds in the hand and birds in the bush.\nThat says that we value certainties over probabilities. Time preference also values\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 3\npresent certainties over future certainties. The reason is studied in a branch of\neconomics called “capital theory”. My next generation theory, really Petty’s of 1662,\nproposes what the average-risk time discount rate is and why. Present value of each\nexpected instant of future satisfaction grows at that rate as time shortens the\ndiscount period. It disappears, as apples from the tree, when expectation matures\ninto reality.\nThis diamond ring parable is full of useful lessons. I think it contains substantially all\nof economics. “Consider the lilies of the field.” “They also serve who only stand and\nwait.” A chemist would testify that the ring has done nothing. An economist sees\nplenty happening. Economics is abstraction. Physical capital is not things, and\nhuman capital is not people. It’s all in the mind. What an economist sees is present\nvalue evolving with time as expectations ripen and eventuate. Output is not what we\ndo, although it has to do with what we do. It is the passage of time. Exhaust is the\nfruition of time and the harvest reaped.\nOnly when we allow psychic values can we say that all behavior is economic\nbehavior. It is choices among alternatives. That’s what makes economics philosophy.\nAxioms\nThen what should its axioms be? We would like empirical or real-world certainties. I\nfind none beyond Descarte’s cogito. Philosophy is certain of next to nothing. We\nsettle for working assumptions. We want ones as safe and few as possible. Those of\neconomics have usually been left implicit since the marginalist revolution. I dropped\nthe course because I felt their need. It should do no harm, at this point, to risk the\nopposite extreme. Let’s try putting everything on the table.\nMy first axiom, in that spirit, will be unguided natural causality. This need not alarm\nthe devout. It is the working assumption of all science. Working assumptions are\nnot creeds. I cannot rule out the possibility of occasional or even continuous\nintervention by God to explain what we see. But we know to act as if we ruled it out\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 4\nwhen our science hats are on. Even philosophy, in the Western tradition, leaves\nrevelation aside. A practical consideration is that debates of how God is likely to be\nmotivated to intercede have tended to find little consensus or traction. Science gets\nsome.\nI tipped my hand on my own views in Chapter 1. As chairman of the Leakey\nFoundation for more than 40 years, I pretty clearly buy evolution theory and\nunguided natural casualty as working assumptions. But I invite those who don’t to\nread further before deciding that we will disagree on conclusions. If I foresaw a\nconflict with the devout, which I don’t, I would feel obligated to warn them now. I’ll\nbring this up again as we go along.\nMy next few axioms, lumped together, are a mortal and reproducing population\nwhich competes, cooperates and freelances to act on convergent predictions. It acts\nto satisfy convergent tastes in a world of limited resources. I will model the\npopulation as human, although other species would do insofar as my axioms hold\nfor them. “Convergent” means non-identical from individual to individual or place to\nplace or moment to moment, but converging to norms with increasing scale in space\nand time. Predictions converge to outcomes as well as to one another.\nThe point is that tastes and predictions must be convergent enough for markets to\nform and hold. A market, as Becker knew, is where anyone makes any choice among\nalternatives. A literal market is where a choice leaves a quantitative record. Markets\ncannot form and hold if we cannot predict where to find them and what they supply\nand when they are open. They cannot form and hold without some consensus that\nwhat we predict they will offer includes something we want. Clothing stores can\nwork because our sizes and shapes fall mostly within standard ranges. Their\nbusiness would be in trouble if we did not agree in number and rough placement of\narms and legs and head. Restaurants can work because we can find what we want\non a finite menu. Most crucially, clothing stores and restaurants cannot hold unless\nthere is consensus on what their wares are worth in return. All this convergence\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 5\nsuggests a single species, although the axiom only said population. The ants and the\npicnickers can compete for the lunch, but they cannot bargain for it. The bar in Star\nWars is a great gag because it thumbs its nose at this home truth. We converge in\ntaste for the hilarious.\nI will add the biological imperative as a separate axiom later, although much of that\nat least may be implicit in the first one of natural causality. We hate unnecessary\naxioms, from good Occamite principle, but we hate unsupported inference or\nquestion-begging worse.\nI spell out the axiom of mortality and reproduction because I know I’m heading\ntowards Petty’s insight and next generation theory. Of course we design foundations\nto support what we want on top. It seems to me that my axioms mention nothing\nabout rationality, whatever that might mean, except in the sense of assumed\nconvergence of predictions to outcomes. And that assumption itself might not be\ncritical. What seems critical that is the predictions should converge to a known\nfunction of outcomes. If they converge to something predictably overoptimistic or\noverpessimistic, we’re still in business. Lacking even that, economic science is\nstillborn. We can’t predict chaos.\nThat’s an example of the principle that axioms need not be strictly true. They must\nbe true enough. We’re still in business if God intervenes a little here and there. Much\nmore than that, and the convergent prediction axiom runs into the problem of\npredicting the mind of God.\nThe two convergence axioms, of tastes and predictions, are implicit in all\nmicroeconomics. “Micro”, as economists call it, is about supply meeting demand at\nprice equilibrium. This insight was the main theme of the marginalist revolution. It’s\nexactly what can’t happen without convergent tastes and predictions. It’s exactly\nwhy the bar in Star Wars is a hoot. Ants find price equilibria in ant markets, and\npeople in people markets. Ants and people find no meeting of the minds. Then if\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 6\nmacroeconomics (“macro”) rests on micro, the convergence axioms say only what\neconomics has accepted implicitly since micro began. The “law of one price”,\nmeaning market equilibrium, actually begins a century and a half earlier with\nCantillon. But Jevons, in co-founding the marginalist revolution in 1871, effectively\nmade it an axiom.\nI don’t want to seem to claim that the convergence axioms are safe because they are\naccepted. Arguments ad majoritatem or ad auctoritatem prove nothing. But markets\ndo seem to form and hold, and the convergences seem implied. Authority and\nmajority are sometimes right.\nNot all economists have agreed. There have been “historicists” and\n“institutionalists” who mistrust the idea of convergent tastes, and prefer to see\nidiosyncratic national tradition or power groups or mindsets as the prime movers in\nplace of uniform human nature. Heinrich Schmoller, a historicist who stressed\nnational differences, tangled with Carl Menger, an independent co-founder of the\nmarginalist revolution in 1871, in a childish feud for which Menger was at least as\nmuch to blame. If you must answer your critics, be gracious. Thorstein Veblen, an\ninstitutionalist from Wisconsin, coined the term “neoclassicism” for what we now\ncall marginalism. He made fun of it for missing the role of institutions in driving\neconomies for institutional or collective goals rather than individual human ones.\nI think there’s something there. My main theme in this book is growth theory at the\ncollective scale. I argue that collective growth flourishes where laws and practices\nand cultures nurture and protect it. These are national institutions. New ideas, by\ndefinition, are opposite from the fungible commodities for which supply and\ndemand meet at price equilibria. Somehow they come. Dogs bark, cats climb, people\ninnovate. I’m with Menger and Jevons and the marginalists and human nature, but\nwith asterisks there too. There is plenty left for historicists and institutionalists to\nhelp explain.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 7\nVocabulary and Catechism\nThe words microeconomics and macroeconomics, by the way, didn’t exist until\nRagnar Frisch coined them in the 1920s. We use terms retrospectively to describe\nold arguments in language familiar now. That segues into the next steps in the\nfoundations. What should be the basic vocabulary and catechism, meaning basic\nlogic, in terms understood today?\nConsideration of purpose always comes first. The purpose of economics is\nprediction. We happen to know that one of the most powerful predictors of\neconomic behavior is maximization of risk-adjusted return. This was Robert\nTurgot’s insight of 1766, although he left the risk variable unsaid. (His real first\nname was somehow Anne, so we’ll go with the second). He wrote that return\nequilibrates across markets as investors leave low-return businesses to crowd into\nhigher-return ones. The shift bids up capital denominators in the higher-return\nbusinesses, and conversely, until return converges. It was David Ricardo, in 1817\nwho added that the convergence is more exactly for businesses judged equal in risk.\nThe evidence is everywhere we look. I call this the maximand rule: all behavior\nmaximizes perceived risk-adjusted rate of return. I’ll show its proof below. That\nmeans all behavior in all markets, and markets are where any choice among\nalternatives is made. Return means ratio of (net) output to capital generating it.\nThen the vocabulary wanted might as well include capital and output.\nBut what is capital? Economics is choices, and the measure is price or value. Price\ncan’t be measured exactly outside literal markets, which is why economists follow\nthose markets, but is measured in principle by what we give up in exchange. The\nprice of any capital, even human capital, is given by the present value rule as timediscounted\ncash flow. Then cash flow and its positive and negative components\nbelong to the basic vocabulary, while the present value and maximand rules both\nbelong in the catechism. Output is total return, so the total return truism belongs in\nthe catechism too.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 8\nWhat other basic terms do we need? Cash flow at the collective scale, where\ntransfers cancel internally, and there is no source of investment from outside,\nsimplifies to exhaust of value in taste satisfaction. There is no negative component\nbecause there is no external source of new investment. Tradition through most of\neconomic history has called this exhaust consumption. Schultz recognized some\nconsumption as investment in human capital, I said earlier, and limited the exhaust\nto “pure consumption”. I will use this and the term “exhaust” interchangeably. Then\ntransfer, consumption, exhaust and pure consumption belong in the vocabulary too.\nSo does “invested consumption”, my restatement of Schultz’ “pure investment” in\nhuman capital.\nThis seems to be the right track. The object is prediction of behavior. The maximand\nrule predicts all behavior, and I have sought to build a vocabulary and catechism to\nclarify its terms. The right vocabulary, thank gosh, is mostly the one we have all used\nsince Adam Smith or even Petty. It has needed only a little tweaking and\nclarification, as to the two kinds of capital and consumption for example.\nThere is a “fundamental theorem” of calculus showing how differentials and\nintegrals fit together. Its proof takes a lot of thought. There is a simpler one for\nalgebra. Might a fundamental theorem of economics be helpful? Obvious candidates\nwould include the maximand rule predicting all behavior, the total return truism\nexplaining the output numerator of the maximand (rate of return), and the present\nvalue rule explaining the capital denominator. For years I chose the maximand rule\nas the fundamental theorem. Then I preferred the present value rule as more\nfundamental since it explained the denominator. But so would be the total return\ntruism in explaining the numerator. Now I opt for the judgment of Paris. Let the\nthree together be the fundamental theorems of economics. The maximand rule is\nthe centerpiece, and the other two define its terms. All three together are much\neasier to follow, mercifully, then the one of calculus.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 9\nThe vocabulary can also include the standard distinction among stocks, flows and\nrates. These are only definitions, not assumptions. Stocks means value measured in\nmoney units, say dollars. This is not the same as stock in the sense of equity\nsecurities, although those can be examples. Flows means processes such as output\nfor consumption measured in dollars per unit time. Flows are to stocks as verbs to\nnouns. Percent rates are flows divided by stocks, as rate of return or growth rate,\nand are measured in pure numbers over time such as 5% per year.\nNow for the fundamental theorems. Take the present value rule first. It starts from\nthe axiom that we satisfy convergent tastes in the light of convergent predictions. In\na simple case, we foresee that an asset (stock) is likely to yield a certain amount of\ntaste satisfaction flow at a certain future time. We discount that expected amount at\na time preference or time discount rate given by our taste for impatience, tempered\nby our taste for risk avoidance, to find its present value. Present value of the whole\nasset is the sum of present values of all the expected future satisfactions together.\nA more general case allows for transfers. The future events we foresee and discount\nare not always exhaust in taste satisfaction by ourselves at the time. Some might be\nforeseen liquidations to reinvest in other assets or to give away so that we or the\ndonee can realize the taste satisfaction later. Either reinvestment or gift is called\ntransfer. I call it “transfer out”, meaning out from the generating asset. Then\ntransfer out = reinvestment + gift. (3.1)\nThere can also be transfer in. Sometimes future realizations, in taste satisfaction or\ntransfer out, are not explained as production by the asset as it is now. The asset\nmight grow later by new investment from outside, and the investment in between\nmight help explain the later yield. If an eighth-grader is destined to become a doctor,\nfor example, her foreseen earnings as a doctor will presuppose investment in high\nschool and college and med school in between.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 10\nThe expected future flow we discount to present value, allowing for transfers too, is\nexhaust plus transfer out less transfer in. This net difference is called cash flow. That\nis,\ncash flow = exhaust + transfer out – transfer in. (3.2)\nThat’s the logic behind the present value rule interpreting capital as discounted cash\nflow.\nHuman cash flow may not be defined in those words anywhere but in this book. But\nthe flow discounted to find human capital is understood everywhere, I think, as pay\nless what Schultz called pure investment and I call invested consumption. I\ndefended this idea in my analogy between human capital and the firm. Thus I\nendorse the tradition that human capital is pay less invested consumption\ndiscounted to present value. That is,\nhuman cash flow = pay – invested consumption.\nIt turns out that this is not logical certitude, or an inference from axioms already\ngiven, and so it is not strictly part of the foundations. I will defend it in later\nchapters.\nThe great convenience of the present value rule and its application to human capital\nis that it allows the factors to be added as a dollar sum. That helps in understanding\nthe total return rule.\nThat rule begins with the truism that growth of anything is internal creation plus\nflow passed in less flow passed out. That shows as\ngrowth = creation + flow passed out – flow passed in. (3.3)\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 11\nAlgebra now allows\ncreation = growth + flow passed out – flow passed in,\n(3.3a)\nsince terms can change sides if they reverse signs.\nEconomics is interested in creation and growth of value. Value in the stock sense\nmeans capital in general. Most economists most of the time use the word to mean\nonly the “physical capital” we buy and sell. But the truism works for anything. I\nsometimes prefer the generality of “value”, meaning any amount of any mix of\nhuman and physical capital. This again can be called either “total capital” or value\ninterchangeably.\nFlow of value passed out is exhaust plus transfer out, and flow passed in is transfer\nin. Creation of value is output in the net sense. Then (3.2) and (3.3a) give the total\nreturn rule\noutput = growth + cash flow.\n(3.3b)\n“Income” means rights to output, and is implicitly equal to output. Like most writers\nin economics, I will use these words more or less interchangeably too.\nNow comes the centerpiece. A good starting point is the present value rule. We\nassemble value or total capital to satisfy foreseen tastes. But we also satisfy current\ntastes by spending current cash flow. At the scale of the total capital (value) of the\nindividual, were reinvestment cancels internally, cash flow simplifies to exhaust in\ntaste satisfaction plus gift given less gift received. Then\nindividual cash flow = net gift + exhaust, (3.4)\nwhere net gift means gift given less gift received.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 12\nConsider net gift. Its negative component, gift received, is concurrently added either\ninto total capital growth or into exhaust. Thus it is the contribution to those two\ndesiderata explained from outside, rather than by the individual’s behavior. Net gift\ndeducts that negative component (gift received) from the positive one to leave the\npart which the individual’s behavior explains. Thus individual output, as the sum of\ngrowth and net gift, is the sum of desiderata realized by behavior. That makes it the\nunique behavioral maximand as a flow. Division by the individual’s total capital,\nwhich is her whole means of behavior, gives total capital rate of return as the rate\nmaximand.\nThis can be summarized in a slightly different way. Cash flow measures the means of\ntaste satisfaction now. Total capital growth measures gain in means of expected\nsatisfactions, discounted according to our taste for impatience (time preference)\ntempered by our taste for risk aversion. Output is their sum. Behavior reveals and\nmaximizes the taste satisfaction including provision for future satisfaction.\nTherefore risk-adjusted output is the flow maximand. Capital of both factors, at\npresent value, is defined as the whole means of that satisfaction, and implicitly of\nbehavior. Therefore risk-adjusted return, the ratio of the flow maximand to its\nmeans, is the rate maximand.\nWhat Turgot said in 1766, in his Reflections, was\n“. . . as soon as the profits of one employment of money. . . increase or\ndiminish, capitals turn in that direction. . . or withdraw and turn to other\nemployments. . . Whatever the manner in which money is employed, its\nproduct cannot increase or diminish without all the other employments\nexperiencing a proportionate increase or diminution.”\nTurgot did not allow for risk in this quick summary, but otherwise explained the\nmechanics that tend to equalize return.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 13\nThe rule does not say that risk-adjusted return tends to hold constant over time. To\nthe contrary. Return equals growth plus cash flow, and my charts show the growth\ncomponent as a bucking bronco. The maximand rule says only that risk-adjusted\nreturn is always the maximand. It is not always the same as time changes\ncircumstances. Proof is in Turgot’s equalization of return at each moment, not from\none moment to the next. That is what we see wherever we look.\nThere is a quibble worth attention. Behavior seldom expresses taste exactly. We say\none word when we mean another. We reach for the coffee, and accidentally spill it.\nThat was the point of my axiom that predictions converge to outcomes, as well as to\none another, only on average. Outcomes are generally a little better or a little worse\nthan predicted. There can even be systematic bias where all people together seem\noveroptimistic or overpessimistic accordingly to circumstances, as shown in the\npsychological economics of Hanneman and Tversky. The axiom requires that these\nbiases offset over scale and time. That sounds plausible, and anyhow makes analysis\neasier.\nThe maximand rule would be ridiculous if terms were defined in a literal market\ncontext only. Markets must be defined as wherever any choice is made. It would be\nridiculous if cash flow were understood to presuppose literal cash, or even the\nnecessity of some quid pro quo to explain motivations. Unreciprocated gift down the\ngenerations drives lineage survival.\nAll behavior means all behavior. The miser maximizes the growth component in\nreturn, the parent or philanthropist maximizes the net gift component, and the\ngood-time Charlie maximizes exhaust.\nHave I gone too far in this claim? Try to imagine an exception. What kind of behavior\nmight not maximize perceived risk-adjusted return? What if I jump out the window?\nDeliberately drive my car into a tree? Sell a cow for a handful of beans? Maximize a\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 14\npile of nuclear waste in my safe instead of cash and securities? Drive a truck filled\nwith dynamite into a crowd of unbelievers? Write a book on economics when I have\nno credentials? Sing when I have an atrocious voice? All express my tastes. There is\nno escape. Behavior reveals taste satisfaction in the broad sense including provision\nfor future satisfactions.\nTastes, Aims and Ends\nI usually mean the word “tastes” as objectives whose satisfaction exhausts capital\nvalue. By that usage, as we just saw, the truism that behavior reveals tastes must be\ninterpreted carefully. We see current taste satisfaction at mealtimes. Between meals,\nwe mostly see buildup of capital to satisfy tastes in future. And we sometimes are\nmotivated to give capital away, as in raising the generation to succeed us. I\nsometimes use the term “aims” to mean the sum of this exhaust plus gift plus\nbuildup. Then to say that output realizes growth plus cash flow is to say that it\nrealizes aims. All behavior reveals and maximizes aims explained by ends. This\nagain puts the maximand rule in a different way.\nAs capital of both factors is our whole means of behavior, and as it is present value\nof foreseen taste satisfaction and nothing else, we might first suppose that taste\nsatisfaction is our unique final goal. But that too could mislead. Biology shapes our\ntastes, and shapes them to replicate the generations. I treat the biological imperative\nas the “ends” driving tastes and aims. Our two complementary ends are adult\nsurvival and replication of both factors for survival of the young. This idea underlies\nnext generation theory.\nWhat we maximize is risk-adjusted present value of current plus foreseen taste\nsatisfactions by ourselves plus donees. Current taste satisfaction or exhaust by\nourselves is counted at full value, and foreseen ones are added at a time discount.\nTransfer is part of the mechanics. The exhaust plus growth plus gift are the aims, in\nwhatever proportion we like, and our subliminal deeper motive of lineage survival\nis the ends.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 15\nSubjective Certitude\nTautologies or truisms are logical certitudes. My three fundamental theorems are\ncases in point. The total return truism is a classical example. Since growth is\ncreation less net outflow, creation is growth plus net outflow. This gives unqualified\ncertitude to the doctrine that output, or creation of value, is growth of value plus\ncash flow (net outflow of value).\nThe other two fundamental theorems are certitudes in a subjective sense. What they\npredict infallibly is intentions. The present value rule must give capital value as we\nsee it individually. Only under the convergence axioms does it predict observed\nmarket equilibria. The same is true of the maximand rule. This rested on the same\naxioms and the one that a population acts to satisfy tastes (in the sense of aims).\nThere are schools of thought, including Popperians and deconstructionists, which\ndisapprove of logical certitude on grounds not clear to me. They are wrong. A rose is\na rose. Nor are all examples as inane as that one from Gertrude Stein. All of math is\nderived as logical certitude. Its proof comes from analysis, not experiment. Proof of\nFermat’s last theorem eluded some of the finest minds in the world for three\ncenturies until Andrew Wiles published the solution in 1995. Philosophy is precisely\na search for hidden truisms or tautologies. Economics is philosophy when it does\nthe same. The pay rule shows that their inferences can be startling. Age-wage\nprofiles are technically illustration, not proof, of the proposition that human\ndepreciation is expected to be recovered in pay. That follows from definitions and\nneeds no evidence in proof.\nThe pay rule is not wholly logical certitude because it also proposes that\nmaintenance consumption is not recovered in pay. Rather I argue that from the\nbiological imperative: maintenance is exhausted in satisfying our taste for adult\nsurvival. The fact that few can have doubted this since the physiocrats has nothing\nto do with proof. The shock, anyhow, is in the expected recovery of human\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 16\ndepreciation. This opened a can worms. It contradicts the Y = C + I equation, and the\nrelated belief that output equals profit plus pay. I will try to track down some of the\nworms, as I promised, and release new ones in the process if I must.\nThis book will continue to hunt for certitude, absolute when possible and subjective\notherwise. If the convergence axioms are trustworthy, behavior will reveal aims\nwell enough.\nOutput Exhaust\nI define output as creation of value, and equivalently of capital. Does this overlook\nthe possibility that output might also create taste-satisfying pure consumption\ndirectly, without passing through a capital phase first?\nSuch a thing is possible in math, but not in economics. Since capital is foreseen\neventual exhaust, exhaust not drawn from capital in place would be implicitly\nunforeseen. This is the flip side of the deadweight loss rule. Economics is a rationale\nof choices, and neglects unforeseen taste satisfaction as unable to influences choices.\nThose unforeseen and hence costless satisfactions are called “free goods”, and\nignored as outside the economic purview. They why not ignore free growth too?\nGrowth is roughly foreseen and factored into choices, for one thing, even if I am the\nfirst since Mill to foresee it as free. For another, even unforeseen events are of\neconomic interest if they affect means or choices after. Free growth does. Costless\nsatisfactions leave no trace.\nNote in any case that the total return truism (3.2) through (3.3b) does not depend\non this inference. Those equations describe creation of value, not necessarily of\ncapital alone. Output exhaust would be added both to output and to exhaust, and\nwould disappear in their difference.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 17\nBasic Glossary\nI use standard terms when I can find them, and coin new ones like “aims” and “ends”\nwhen I can’t. But even standard ones are ambiguous. The vocabulary of economics is\nnot settled. Look up “capital” or “output” or “cash flow”, for example, in any\neconomic dictionary. It will show ranges of meanings, and appreciably different\nones from one dictionary to the next.

The vocabulary is about the same as\nin Adam Smith, and the three fundamental theorems are well accepted. Any\ncomposer knows that originality should be incidental. Our music says what we think\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 19\nneeds saying. If it does, that tends to mean that it is new to the current conversation.\nIt need not be new to the world.\nAll three fundamental theorems are part of the daily conversation of investors and\nfinance economists. They are not much on the screens of microeconomists and\nmacroeconomists. There may have been some originality in spelling out the implicit\naxioms behind them, and in generalizing them into all capital including human\ncapital if we trust those axioms.\nOne of the mini-surprises was that gift appeared in my very first equation. Cash flow\nat the scale of the total capital of the individual, where reinvestment cancels out,\nsimplifies to gift and exhaust alone. Obvious in hindsight, but surprising if we have\nbeen taught that economics is all about numero uno. I think it is about adults giving\nto the young to keep the generations turning.\nThat sets the theme of this book. Old ideas will find unfamiliar combinations and\napplications. Those are originality enough. But so many little stretches of the tried\nand true can be hard to track.\nEconomics needs a special and counterintuitive mindset. The guiding principle is the\nanalysis of the diamond ring. Economics means taking our minds off the physical\nsubstrate. That goes to the corners of our eyes, not the focus. Capital is not people\nand things. It is present value of foreseen cash flows. Output is the ripening of these\nforeseen flows with time, and exhaust is the harvest eventually reaped. Economics\ntakes us through the looking glass to a place the same but different.\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 20\nCHAPTER 4: MILL’S IDEA\nMill’s Paragraph\nIt always seemed obvious to me that growth is free. Survival costs investment in the\nnext generation, but growth costs nothing more. It seemed to me that innovation is\nthe human specialty, that we pay its cost every day as the cost of being human, and\nthat growth happens when genius or circumstance somehow gives it traction. I\nspent most of my life assuming that all economists, but not politicians, thought the\nsame. I since learned that economists, following Solow, teach something close but\ndifferent. So I guessed that I had hit on something new.\nI hadn’t. We read economic history to learn that our ideas are seldom original.\nThomas Malthus, contradicting his friend and rival David Ricardo, wrote something\nlike my or Mill’s free growth theory in 1820. Chapter 7 of his Principles 1 says this in\nseveral ways. One example is\n“When we have attained…increased and steady profits, we may then begin to\naccumulate, and our accumulation will then be effectual. But if, instead of\nsaving from increased profits, we save from diminished expenditure; if, at the\nvery time that supply of commodities compared with the demand for them,\nclearly admonishes us that the proportion of capital to revenue is already too\ngreat, we go on saving to add still further of our capital, all general principles\nconcur in showing that we must of necessity be aggravating instead of\nalleviating our distresses.”\nJohn Rae renewed this theme in 1834. Book 1, Chapter 10 of his New Principles 2\nincludes\n“If an improvement, for instance, in the art of baking bread were effected, by\nwhich, with half the labor and fuel, equally good bread could be produced, it\nwould not benefit the bakers exclusively, but would be felt equally over the\nwhole society. The bakers would have a small additional profit, the whole\nsociety would have bread for the product of somewhat less labor, and all who\n1 Principles of Political Economy Considered with a View to their Practical Applications\n2 Statement of some New Principles on the Subject of Political Economy\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 1\nconsumed bread, that is, every member of society, would from the same\noutlay have somewhat larger returns. The whole series of instruments\nowned by the society would be somewhat more productive, and would be\ncarried to an order of quicker returns.”\nThe clearest expression, and probably clearest even today, came from Mill in 1848.\nHe put it that output growth can precede and explain capital growth as well as the\nreverse. Crediting Rae, he wrote:\nThere are other cases in which the term saving, with the associations usually\nbelonging to it, does not exactly fit the operation by which capital is\nincreased. If it were said, for instance, that the only way to accelerate the\nincrease of capital is by increase of saving, the idea would probably be\nsuggested of greater abstinence, and increased privation. But it is obvious\nthat whatever increases the productive power of labor creates an additional\nfund to make savings from, and enables capital to be enlarged not only\nwithout additional privation, but concurrently with an increase of personal\nconsumption. Nevertheless, there is here an increase of saving, in the\nscientific sense. Though there is more consumed, there is also more spared.\nThere is a greater excess of production over consumption. It is consistent\nwith correctness to call this a greater saving. Though the term is not\nunobjectionable, there is no other which is not liable to as great objections.\nTo consume less than is produced, is saving; and that is the process by which\ncapital is increased; not necessarily by consuming less, absolutely. We must\nnot allow ourselves to be so much the slaves of words, as to be unable to use\nthe word saving in this sense, without being in danger of forgetting that to\nincrease capital there is another way besides consuming less, namely, to\nproduce more.\nThe words “accelerate” and “concurrently” show that Mill understood calculus. His\nautobiography says that he hadn’t really learned it from his father James, who had\nbought a book and was trying to teach himself and the 13-year old son at the same\ntime. The son studied it in his later teens at school in France. He like me was writing\nfor everyone, and preferred to keep explicit math off the page. But the quote\nreminds us that the only alternative in economics is implicit math in sentence form.\nThe paragraph implies the Y = C + I equation: output equals consumption plus\ninvestment. I go a tad farther, starting one chapter ago, by offsetting my word\nequations from the running text. These show equal signs and plus and minus and\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 2\ndivision and multiplication signs, rather than keeping them inside the paragraph\nand writing out such words as “equals” and “plus”. These word equations are\nusually easy enough to read. My appendix will cover them and more in notation.\nMill’s equation may be as old as economics, although I haven’t found it put explicitly\nbefore Keynes wrote it in his General Theory 1936. It is now foundational to national\naccounts and macroeconomics (the art of balancing full employment with price\nstability). I showed why I agree only if we add a couple of imaginary asterisks. We\nhave to mean total capital growth and pure consumption. Mill and tradition have\nmeant physical capital and all consumption.\nThat leaves me with something like the heuristic problem of Halliday and Resnick.\nThey started with Newton as something familiar and accessible and commonsensical.\nI will follow suit. I will reason as if Mill’s equation were right. My own\nargument is exactly the same if we remember the hidden asterisks. That saves us all\nthe trouble of going through it twice. Chapter 4 will restate it in terms of total\nincluding human capital just to make sure.\nIt is an unsettling argument either way. It unsettled Solow. Chapter 2 showed why.\nWe are probably more comfortable to think of income as something known which\nwe can slice into consumption and saving slices as we like. Less of one would mean\nthat much more of the other. That would put us in charge. We can always consume\nless by will power. If less consumption meant more growth, we could grow at will.\nKeynes showed otherwise by invoking the old paradox of thrift. If everyone put\nmoney in vaults instead of consuming, consumption would go down while money\npiled up. But the added money would find less output to buy with it, as nothing new\nwas created to compensate for the drop in consumption. The value of the piled-up\nmoney would vanish in inflation. Saving would equal investment in the end because\nboth disappeared. The Y = C + I equation shows the math. It say that less\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 3\nconsumption C means either more investment I or less output Y. It doesn’t say\nwhich happens.\nInvestment, for Keynes, meant creation of new productive assets. He was right in\nseeing that as the goal. But his analysis leaves too much outside. What I miss is a\nvariable for investment quality. Investments in new productive assets in 1929 or\n2008 yielded negative return. Money in vaults did better.\nI prefer an approach which takes our minds off the ultimate goal in new productive\nassets. I drop all distinctions between saving and investment. Either word means\nthe other. What matters is its intended and realized return. That is the missing\nquality variable. Notice that I don’t have to specify “risk-adjusted” return because\nKeynes and I are describing only at the collective (national) scale. Risk of all\ninvestments collectively is average risk. This can be implicit whenever I describe at\nthe collective scale.\nKeynes’ analysis and equations appear in his General Theory. He was addressing the\nworld depression. A theme was that households do most saving, while businesses do\nmost investing. Banks collected the saving and made it available for business to\nborrow and invest. But business lacked the “animal spirits” to take such a risk in a\nslump. We saw the same story after 2008. Keynes’ proposal was for government to\ndo the borrowing and investing instead. That’s part of the “fiscal policy” I described\nin Chapter 1. Here we tend to agree. That would explain his sense of urgency as to\nnew productive capital as the most direct way to put idle plant and workers back to\nwork.\nI prefer to suspend judgment on what is a new productive asset and what isn’t. I\nthink my way of putting things is both simpler and subtler than Keynes’, although at\nsacrifice of his explicit focus. Saving and investment, in my language, are the same\nfrom the start. The maximand is return. Consumption foregone will translate into\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 4\ncapital growth insofar as rate of return actually realized matches the current norm.\nLess return makes less growth than consumption sacrificed, and more makes more.\nBut collective return can be a surprise. Boom years and bust years arrive unforeseen.\nThe cost of investment in consumption given up, whether individually or collectively,\nnever agrees exactly with what it proves to be worth at market. Gunnar Myrdal, in\n1939, coined the terms ex ante for the first and ex post for the second. The bucking\nbronco describes the ex post picture overall.\nEx ante (at cost) and ex post (at market) investment agree when market-realized\nreturn holds unchanged. Lower return means that ex post outcomes fell short of ex\nante cost and expectations. Higher return means the reverse. That gives the context\nof Mill’s idea. And he clearly isn’t talking about growing or declining by random luck.\nHis prime mover is “whatever increase the productive power of labor.” He knew\nthat this meant innovative ideas. Can we dial them in as we like? All he says is that\nthey need cost nothing in consumption missed. Then how might that work?\nGross and Net Investment\nKeynes, accepting the Y = I + C equation, defined saving S as gross income less\nconsumption C. I draw the impression that he implicitly defined output as creation\nof economic value. So do I. He defined gross investment I as gross output less\nconsumption. Gross in both cases meant gross of depreciation. He knew that income\nand output are equal, at all scales, since the first means rights to the second, and\ngave both the symbol Y as I do. It followed that saving and investment are also\nequal. The meaning was that actually realized saving, as distinct from consumption\nrestraint in hopes of saving, had to be realized in investment. This is the home truth\nwhich I accept but prefer to rephrase.\nI have traced Keynes’ argument and language on these points because I think it is\nnow generally accepted by Keynesian and anti-Keynesian and neo-Keynesian\nschools alike. That’s why I think my own interpretation differs from a general\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 5\nconsensus rather than supports one school over another. I think it is the consensus\nview, as well as Keynes’, that his “attempted saving” means gross saving (gross\nincome less consumption) not invested in new productive assets. That can be\nwritten as\nKeynesian attempted saving – transfer payments\n= Keynesian net saving = Keynesian net investment,\nat any scale.\nI accept Keynes’ definition of transfer payments, and I recognize the importance of\nhis distinction of those from investment in new productive assets which put idle\nplant and workers to work. My interpretation, even so, is that it is better to leave\nthem idle than to put them to work unproductively. Keynes made his opposite view\ncrystal-clear with his brilliant tongue-in-cheek parable of money buried in\nmineshafts and idle workers hired to dig it up. He had a sense of theater as well as a\ngreat mind. And he just might have been right. But I think my way of putting things\nencompasses that possibility. His mineshaft scenario works if it somehow\nmaximizes return in the big picture.\nMy language differs from Keynes’ in several ways. I prefer Myrdal’s ex ante – ex post\ndichotomy, published three years after the General Theory, to Keynes’ equivalent\nattempted-realized one. Like Myrdal, and unlike Keynes, I apply it to investment as\nwell as saving. That’s why I treat them as synonymous. And I prefer to recognize\nhuman capital explicitly. Keynes surely understood the concept. He was the star\npupil of Alfred Marshall’s later teaching career, unless he shared that distinction\nwith his lifelong personal friend and professional adversary Arthur Pigou, and\nMarshall and Pigou both describe human capital in principle. Marshall wrote that he\nneglected it as something outside what he saw as the main sequence ending with\nconsumption. Keynes could have agreed, or could have meant to provide for it\nimplicitly by defining output as investment plus consumption while realizing that\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 6\nsome consumption is investment in human capital. I said what I think this overlooks\n(self-invested work) and what it forgets to exclude (recovered human depreciation).\nMy own way of putting things mightn’t strictly need the terms investment or saving\nexcept to translate my ideas into the language we all know. That translation is\nessential if I hope to be understood. It will first take account of the fact that Keynes\nmeant investment and saving as to physical capital only, with labor or human capital\nto arrive exogenously as an outcome somehow of consumption. That led to the\nY = I + C equation\noutput = investment + consumption. (4.1)\nGross and net versions of (4.1) meant gross and net of depreciation. Thus\ngross output = gross investment + consumption\n(4.1a)\nand\nnet output = net investment + consumption.\n(4.1b)\nIn the General Theory, where (4.1) appears in his Chapter 6, (4.1) it means the gross\nversion unless otherwise specified. I prefer the opposite, and mean the net version\n(4.1b) unless otherwise specified.\nMy ex ante investment corresponds to Keynes’ “intended saving” through\nconsumption restraint. My “depreciation investment”, or “depreciation plowback”,\nmeans just enough ex ante investment to offset actual depreciation, not book\ndepreciation, of physical capital. I assume that we intuit roughly how much this is\nwhen I say that optimum ex ante investment is depreciation plowback. Now let’s\nconsider how that could be true.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 7\nGrowth Mechanics\nStart with simplicity. Imagine a changeless world where people and things replicate\nthemselves exactly. Chapter 3 showed that in total capital terms including human\ncapital, although neither Mill nor Keynes used them, depreciation of both factors\ntogether, net of transfers from one to the other, equals exhaust in taste satisfaction.\n“Replacement investment,” or “depreciation investment,” is just enough to turn the\ngenerations over as new (net) output makes up the loss to consumption exactly.\nIdeas hold unchanged. That wouldn’t be too far from the truth for our million years\nas homo erectus, or our millennia after as homo sapiens until some 50,000 years ago,\nor our centuries in the dark ages after Rome fell. Most of the new norms we\ninnovated, although not all, eventually regressed to the old ones.\nNext imagine growth of everything at a constant rate. Capital, consumption and\noutput all grow in constant proportion. Economists now call this “balanced” growth.\nMill had described that possibility in 1844. Balanced growth isn’t driven by\nconsumption restraint, as consumption never lags. And it isn’t driven by\nproductivity gain, meaning more output per unit capital, since output grows no\nfaster. What drives it?\nSuppose first that there are still no new ideas. If we are pioneers in a new world or\nempty niche, we might be able to increase numbers of exactly the same things and\nskill sets until we reach niche limits. Then what would pay for capital growth in that\ncase? Zeno the Eleatic might insist that depreciation investment is never enough\nbecause it chases a moving target. But depreciation moves just as fast. Identical\ncapital means identical in depreciation rates. That means the ratio of depreciation\n(pure consumption) to capital. The two racers hold neck and neck indefinitely.\nDepreciation investment is still enough, just as it was in the growthlessness before.\nIn balanced growth, as in standing still, it is the only need for of capital replacement.\nNow comes a tougher problem. Niches in the real world are typically more or less\nfull. Here old ideas alone can’t bring growth. David Ricardo, Thomas Malthus and\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 8\nEdward West had written in 1815 that in economies already developed, there isn’t\nmuch room for more capital of the same kind. Its productivity disappears in capital\nglut and diminishing returns. There could still be growth when some of the new\nideas would need only redeployment of existing kinds of capital, as in relocating\nproduction nearer to the market or cutting out the middleman. This redeployment\nwas Solow’s “disembodied growth.” But growth after that have to come from capital\nnew in kind. Hourglasses might have to give place to pocket watches, or sailing ships\nto steamships. Those were Solow’s “embodied” growth.\nThe apparent problem here is that novelty is expensive. There are blind alleys and\nfailure rates and learning curves that rote replication avoids. This is true somewhat\neven in disembodied growth, where redeployment is already a step into the\nunfamiliar. If depreciation investment is barely enough for balanced growth without\nnew ideas, how can it also pay for the failure rates and learning curves?\nA tough question. And Mill was posing an even tougher one. The paragraph quoted\nis clearly describing capital acceleration. Capital as he describes it is not only\ninnovating consistently as it keeps up with consumption, but picking up the pace,\nand still taking the innovation costs in stride. Is that too much even for Achilles?\nIt is not. Charts and tables show that the kind of growth Mill describes has proved\nthe only kind in every country and period where tests are practical. It has proved\nthe only kind whether capital was growing faster or shrinking faster or anything\nbetween. The growth bronco bucks, and the consumption rider stays on. This is\nwhat clearly happens, or anyhow has happened so far, despite so many reasons to\nthink it is impossible. What would explain it?\nFirst take the lesser puzzle. Balanced growth, where capital, output and\nconsumption all grow at the same constant rate, must make do with depreciation\ninvestment. How can it in crowded niches where growth compels the costs of\ninnovation? Chapter 2 showed my inference that these are the costs of being human.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 9\nWe were paying them as homo habilis two million years ago. The cost went up, but\nthe value of innovation just as much, when homo erectus arrived a little later. Both\nrose again with the emergence of Ancestral Eve 200,000 years ago. Adaptation is the\nhuman specialty. Its what gets us through the day. Innovation is adaptation that\nhappens to become new norms. It started leaving a record of embodied growth\nabout 50,000 years ago. That doubled pace about 400 years ago. The costs of being\nhuman are the same failure rates and learning curves whether the payoff in\nadaptation/innovation means faster gain in good times or slower decline in bad\nones. We row at a steady stroke, and gain against the shoreline when our new ideas\nare particularly good ones and the current is right.\nMy idea, whether or not Mill’s, is that these costs might be about the same for\nbreakthroughs or meta-ideas or paradigm shifts as for modest upgrades, or even for\nholding even in a world of daily surprises. Ideas trade in an inefficient market. Cost\nis dissociated from value, and cause is desynchronized from effect, by the vagaries of\ngenius and the whim of circumstance.\nNow the tougher puzzle. How can consumption keep up with capital even in\naccelerations? That’s what Mill described, and that’s what happens. Can Achilles\ncatch the tortoise even when the tortoise speeds up? Put your money on Achilles.\nHere it is Gunnar Myradal to the rescue. The apparent problem is that ex ante\ndepreciation investment is never enough in acceleration. But the charts and tables\nshow unanswerably that ex post depreciation investment is. We sow the first, but\nreap the second. Plowback of depreciation investment is up to us. Growth is\nwhatever is added by genius or happenstance. The difference between market value\nand cost is sometimes luck, which neither loses nor gains in the long run, but\nsometimes imagination. Mother Nature and Gunnar Myrdal simultaneously say\n“Shazam”, and convert new ideas into embodied or disembodied growth without\nsurcharge for the novelty.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 10\nThat still leaves the mystery only half solved. How exogenous (sourced from\noutside) are the genius and happenstance? Can we coax them along by policy? That\nisn’t really my field. What seems reasonably clear is that growth flourishes in\nsecular free markets with solid infrastructure and rule of law. How to get those\nthings is the problem. I will suggest that the answers, whatever they are, will be\ndeveloped outside the usual marginalist perspective of supply and demand.\nThe Free Growth Equations\nNow back to Mill’s argument. Notice first that he puts it all in the present tense.\nModern growth economists have preferred what I called the lagged flows method:\nspikes in investment are compared to later ones in output. Mill here is substituting\nwhat I called a concurrent rates method: he compares changes in consumption rate\nto changes in capital growth rate at the same time. He writes that “whatever\nincreases the productive power of labor … enables capital to be enlarged …\nconcurrently with an increase of personal consumption.”\nLet’s follow that. Mill’s root assumption is the Y = I + C equation in its net form\n(4.1b). Put the ex post version as\noutput = growth + consumption, (4.2)\nmeaning net output, growth of physical capital and all consumption. The Y rule says\nthe same with the hidden asterisks after growth and consumption. So it will\ncontinue for the rest of this discussion. (4.2) shows that less consumption implies\nmore growth, or less output, or some of both. Mill was asking which. To show how\nto find out, first arrange (4.2) as\ngrowth = output – consumption,\n(4.2a)\nagain because terms can change sides if they change signs.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 11\nMill and Keynes and tradition hold (4.2) and (4.2a) as logical certitudes which hold\nconstant over time. I agree if we imagine the asterisks. Constancy over time would\nimply\nchange in growth = change in output – change in consumption. (4.3)\nI take the trouble to derive this as a road I haven’t preferred to follow. I will reason\ninstead in rates rather than flows. Rates, or ratios of flows to capital, effectively\ncancel capital from numerator and denominator. That frees them to show\ncomparison between smaller and larger economies among the eight I test. Mill’s idea,\nor anyhow mine, is that the ratio of consumption to capital in all those countries can\nhold constant. That is what the charts and tables show.\nTo follow that lead, divide (4.2a) by capital. This finds\ngrowth\ncapital\n= output\ncapital – consumption . (4.4)\ncapital\nThat can be put more compactly as\ngrowth rate = capital productivity – consumption rate,\n(4.4a)\nwhere rate always means ratio to capital. That needs a caveat because consumption\nrate in macro means ratio to output. Capital productivity in this sense is also called\nrate of return.\nFor more compactness still, define\nthrift rate = – consumption rate,\nallowing (4.4a) to be restated as\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 12\ngrowth rate = capital productivity + thrift rate.\n(4.4b)\nNotice that we must change the sign before “consumption rate” to find thrift. Change\ndownward in consumption rate is change upward in thrift rate, and conversely.\nFurther\nchange in growth rate = change in capital productivity\n– change in consumption rate, (4.5)\nby the same logic as with (4.3). Save space again by reexpressing (4.5) as\nacceleration = productivity gain + thrift gain.\n(4.5a)\nFinally divide by acceleration to reach\n1 =\nproductivity gain\nacceleration\n+\nthrift gain\nacceleration , (4.6)\nif acceleration is nonzero. Reexpress as\n1 = free growth index + thrift index, (4.6a)\nwhere indexes are undefined if acceleration is zero.\nI think this gets at what Mill meant, and anyhow what I mean. We both describe\nacceleration as well as growth. One night think that his “whatever increases the\nproductive power of labor” is the opposite from my “change in capital productivity.”\nBut they are about the same. Better machines make their operators more productive\nwhether skills have changed or not.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 13\n(4.5) shows something about “balance” or the state where capital, consumption and\noutput grow at the same rate. It confirms the standard teaching that balance is\npossible, although not compelled, when growth rate is constant. It also shows that\nbalance is impossible when growth rate changes. No one disputes that capital\nproductivity (output/capital) always leads, and consumption rate\n(consumption/capital) always lags, in accelerations up and down. Output gets the\nbad news first and the good news first. What the equations leave unspecified is\nwhere capital itself joins the sequence. That is what the evidence in the charts and\ntables tells us.\nIn the case where the free growth index equals one, for example, the above\nequations show\nthrift index =\nthrift gain\nacceleration = 0,\nimplying\n– change in consumption rate\nthrift gain = change in growth rate = 0, and\nchange in consumption rate = 0, or equivalently\nconsumption rate = consumption\ncapital\n= constant, (4.7)\nif acceleration is non-zero. (The reason for that qualifier is that zero acceleration\nmeans zero change in growth rate, and division by zero is a no-no.)\nIn the opposite case where the thrift index is one, the same equations would show\nfree growth index =\nproductivity gain\nacceleration\n=\nchangein productivty rate\nchange in growth rate\n= 0,\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 14\nimplying\nproductivity rate = output\ncapital = constant,\n(4.7a)\nassuming again that acceleration is nonzero.\nThis shows how to find the position of capital in the sequence led by output, and\nhow to test between free growth and thrift theories. The market-valued capital\ndenominator in (4.7) and (4.7a), and the consumption numerator in (4.7), can be\ntaken directly from national accounts data collected at the Piketty-Zucman website.\nThe output numerator in (4.7a) can be constructed as consumption plus current\nchange in market-valued capital. By (4.7), free growth theory (Mill’s idea) predicts a\nroughly constant consumption/capital ratio, even in accelerations and decelerations\nand reversals. Then capital acceleration would lag alongside consumption\nacceleration while output led alone. Thrift theory makes the opposite prediction of a\nroughly constant output/capital ratio, so that output and capital would lead\ntogether while consumption lagged alone. There is no need to measure and test both\nindexes, as either is defined as one less the other. My charts and tables track the free\ngrowth index. They confirm free growth theory in all countries and periods.\nDefining Free Growth and Thrift\n(4.2) through (4.7a) defined the free growth and thrift indexes, but not free growth\nor thrift themselves as flows. Since I will use those terms often, I’d better clear that\nup now. Define\nfree acceleration = productivity gain = gain in rate of return,\nthrift acceleration = thrift gain = drop in cash flow rate,\nand\nso that those sets of terms become interchangeable. Then (4.5a) can be put as\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 15\nacceleration = free acceleration + thrift acceleration.\n(4.5b)\nRates are flows divided by capital expressing them. Then define the two flows as\nfree growth = capital ∗ free acceleration, and (4.8)\nthrift = capital ∗ thrift acceleration, giving (4.9)\ngrowth = free growth + thrift. (4.10)\nThese equations apply equally in continuous or discrete-period time. In the latter,\nthey leave the periods of acceleration and growth unspecified. Marginal or current\nfree growth, as with the speed of a car, is the sum of free accelerations since some\npast origin when growth was zero. So it is with current thrift. That need not place\nthe origin with Ancestral Eve. Surprising as it might seem in the growth age, zero\npoints appear to recur every few minutes at the longest. Online stock index numbers\nreverse direction at least that often. They pass through zero each time. Debt claims\non the corporate sector figure to be less volatile, but equity (stock) ones outweigh\nthem. Then marginal free growth means accumulated free acceleration, or rise in\nrate of return, since the last zero growth point no more than a few minutes ago\nwhen return and cash flow were equal. Growth is free whenever cash flow rate rises\nor holds steady.\nThe Charts and Tables\nMill lacked data to test whether growth tends to lead with output when it changes,\nor to lag with consumption, or something else. So did all economists until national\naccounts began reporting market-valued capital in 1990 or so, and reconstructing it\nbackward over a few decades before. The equations through (4.7) show how to test\nfrom data in the Piketty-Zucman and Global Financial Data websites.\nFirst I downloaded the Piketty-Zucman data for market-valued capital and\nconsumption for all countries and periods. I chose their “private wealth” data for the\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 16\nformer. I neglected “government wealth” net of national debt, which is small and\noften negative, as I don’t feel that I understand it well enough. I took consumption as\nthe sum of personal consumption expenditure (PCE) and government consumption\nexpenditure (GCE). I also downloaded real stock market rates of growth, dividends\nand return from the Global Financial Data website for the same years and countries.\nYearly change in capital in each country gave each year’s capital growth as a flow. I\nadded this to consumption to give what I call market-valued output. I said earlier\nthat Piketty and Zucman should logically have done the same. This gave the values\nfor (4.1) and (4.1a).\nI then divided by year-end capital to give values for (4.3). I next found annual\nchanges in those three to give acceleration, productivity gain and thrift gain as\nshown in (4.5) and (4.5a), and divided by acceleration to find the two indexes of\n(4.6) and (4.6a).\nThe test from Global Financial Data took fewer steps. Stock market growth rate, rate\nof return and dividend rate were downloaded directly. I took them as corresponding\nrespectively to growth rate, capital productivity and consumption rate in (3.3a). I\nfound their annual changes to find values for (3.4a), and again divided by\nacceleration to reach (3.5a).\nThis allows tests of Mill’s idea from national accounts data for all eight nations\nreported at the Piketty-Zucman website, and over their entire reporting periods\nthrough 2010. (The website also reports for Spain, but only since 1993 and without\ndata for consumption.) In each year, for each country, change in capital growth rate\nis compared to change in consumption rate (consumption/capital). If consumption\nrate grows faster than capital growth rate while both grow, or declines faster if both\ndecline, the free growth index in that year is greater than one. If they change at the\nsame rate in the same direction it is one exactly. If both change in the same direction,\nbut consumption changes less, the free growth index is between zero and one. If\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 17\neither grows while the other declines, the index is zero or less; zero if one grew as\nmuch as the other declined, and less if the change in capital growth rate was larger\nthan the opposite one in consumption rate.\nInterpreting the Charts and Tables\nNow look again at the charts captioned “free growth index” in the appendix. I will\nsummarize them and all other charts and tables only briefly here, and save most\ndescription for there. They cover all eight countries. Each chart covering free growth\ntracks three separate versions of the free growth index labeled !\nϕ(K), !\nϕ(K T\n) and\n! ϕ(SM). The one I have discussed so far is ! ϕ(K). ! ϕ(K ) is a version including human\nT\ncapital, and !\nϕ(SM)is taken from stock markets only. will be explained in the\n! ϕ(K ) T\nnext chapter.\nThe powerful spikes both up and down in the free growth charts were described in\nChapter 2. Spikes tend to be explained by the fact that acceleration, the denominator\nin both the free growth and the thrift index, is occasionally close to zero. Near-zero\ndenominators, whether above zero or below, can magnify mismeasurements. Some\ncharts report the free growth index every year, and show all the spikes. Others filter\nout years where denominators fall below a chosen threshold, and spikes disappear\naccordingly. Filtration is unbiased in that free growth index is corrected down as\noften as up.\nWhat jumps out from all those charts is that all versions of the free growth index ϕ\nfluctuate around one. That means that the unshown thrift index fluctuates around\nzero. We just saw that the thrift index will show as negative whenever the thrift\nnumerator and acceleration denominator disagree in sign, meaning that thrift gain\ncoincided with deceleration (negative acceleration) or conversely. Charts and tables\nshow that thrift gain, meaning drop in consumption rate, coincides as often with a\nlower as a higher capital growth rate. Growth by thrift is a theoretical possibility\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 18\nwhich doesn’t actually happen. The means of growth Mill describes in the paragraph\nquoted is the only kind that appears in the record.\nEvidence from Stock Markets\nMarket-valued capital, reported in national accounts since 1990 or so and\nassembled at the convenient Piketty-Zucman website, is measured by a common\nstandard in principle. Measurement begins with stock markets. It should. The stock\nmarket is the most exact source of economic information that I know. With due\nreservations about connivance and “stale prices,” meaning outdated prices from\nearlier days because the stock has not traded since, or anyhow not enough for\nconfidence, we know pretty well what markets think stocks are worth from tick to\ntick.\nWe would know better if markets were perfectly efficient. Proof that they aren’t\nshows in medium-term autocorrelation or trend. Autocorrelation (in price) is\ntendency for markets to be up tomorrow if up today, and down if down. Trend is a\nshorter word for the same. Perfect efficiency ought to show a “random walk” where\nprices change captures all current news, news captures reality without optimistic or\npessimistic bias, and tomorrow’s price direction is as unpredictable as tomorrow’s\nnews. The only exception should be long-term uptrend with productivity gain\nthrough innovation. In this case it is not surprise in the news that brings growth, but\ngradual gain in present value as a foreseen better future is less discounted as it\ndraws nearer.\nThere is chicanery as well as inefficiency. Insiders, braving the legal risks, may take\nadvantage of outsiders. But it is not clear to me that insiders are likelier to be sellers\nthan buyers. National accounts follow prices of publicly traded shares collectively,\nwhere some chicaneries should offset others.\nAllowing for all this, I think national accounts are wise to accept stock prices as the\nbest measure of underlying assets. Intangibles such as patents or market advantages\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 19\nare factored into share prices because they are realities that would be valued as\nsuch by bidders for the assets themselves. It is a mistake, I think, to suppose that\nshares prices would be less volatile if more descriptive of real value underneath.\nThe existence of trends suggests the opposite. Trends would be expected from\nsystematic underreaction to the news, so that reaction catches up later, while\nsystematic overreaction ought to be followed by adjustment in the opposite\ndirection. This gradual rather than immediate digestion of the news would tend to\nsmooth out price response. Trends imply systematic underreaction, not\noverreaction. Market evidence shows something near that random walk as a usual\nrule, implying neither systematic overreaction nor systematic underreaction, but\nwith some episodes of the latter. What would the reason be? My first guess would be\nsomething delaying the mechanics of price reaction when news is particularly\nsurprising. Our sense of where prices should go right now seems not to get them\nthere until later. Prefect reaction to perfect news ought to mean more price\nvolatility, not less, from day to day.\nStocks are more volatile then most assets because most are “leveraged.” Firms may\nissue bonds, and may borrow shorter-term from banks. Fixed interest on those debt\nclaims is paid first. Shareholders get the rest of net output, which itself fluctuates\naround expected norms and is sometimes negative. If a firm’s net profit (net output)\nis one million dollars one year, and one dollar higher the next, net profit will have\nvaried only one ten thousandth of a percent. But if interest payments take up the\nsame million dollars per year, every year, profit left for shareholders will have\ngrown from nothing to one dollar. Its growth rate will have been effectively infinite.\nIf the firm earns two dollars less the year after, it will have to invade capital to pay\nthe interest, and owners take a one-dollar loss. Again the difference is trivial\npercentage-wise to net profit, but diametric to equity investors. The more fixed debt,\nthe more surprise and volatility in whatever is left for shareholders. The ratio of\ndebt to that remainder, called “equity,” is the leverage meant. Stock in this security\nsense means the same as shares or equity.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 20\nNow I’ll try to pull this together. Stock prices collectively, meaning all shares at\ncurrent prices, is called “market cap.” (Cap is capitalization.) Market cap does not\nmeasure the whole underlying value of the issuers, meaning firms that issued the\nstock, since there are debt claims that must be paid off first. It measures the equity\nresidue. It measures that imperfectly because some inefficiency and chicanery are\nhere to stay. It is more volatile than the debt claims because it is leveraged, but\nprobably less volatile, given the observed reality of trends showing smoothed-out\nreaction of share prices to news over time, than what would be bid for the\nunderlying assets, including intangibles, subject to the same debt claims that must\nbe paid off first.\nNational accounts measure market-valued (physical) capital by beginning with\nmarket cap. They then add the market value of debt claims on the same issuers,\nalong with equity and debt claims on the rest of the business sector, and then the\nsame for the housing sector. The sum is “private wealth.” Consumer durables such\nas cars and refrigerators are excluded as impractical to price. Government wealth\nnet of national wealth is tracked separately, and tends to show as slight or negative.\nFinding the Free Growth Index for Stock Markets\nMy concern in this chapter is the stock market as a data source for testing free\ngrowth theory. Here (4.2) would read total return in place of (net) output, while\ngrowth would be in market cap. Consumption in (4.2) would become dividend yield\nin the sense net of capital concurrently raised in new stock issues. The Global\nFinancial Data website summarizes the history of world stock markets from\ninception in about 1700 for U.K., about 1800 in U.S., and later elsewhere. A nice\nfeature of this data source, and most other sources for stock and security\nperformance, is that market values are shown from the start. This left no need to\ncorrect for the inevitable lags in depreciation accounting, which gets the news only\nin purchases or sales.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 21\nGlobal Financial Data reports annual rate of return, growth rate in market cap, and\n“imputed dividend rate” as the difference. Dividend rate itself is reported as\nsomething a little different. I made no attempt to get to the bottom of this distinction,\njust as I made none to allow for editorial bias in the Piketty-Zucman website. I chose\nthe imputed version for logical consistency.\nThis direct information obviates the chain of reasoning from (4.2) to (4.5), and\nallows me to jump to the latter. “Productivity gain” in (4.5) is simply annual change\nin reported rate of return. Acceleration is annual change in reported market cap\ngrowth rate. (4.6a) defines the free growth index as their ratio. !\nϕ(SM), the green\nline, tracks it in the charts. It too fluctuates around the number one. Gains in\ndividend rate have coincided as often with gains in market cap growth rate as with\ndrops.\nThis seems only to expound what everyone knows. Of course firms are likelier to\nraise dividends in years of growth, and cut them in years of decline. I never claimed\nthat free growth theory does more than state the obvious. What is made obvious by\nthe data is that a change in total return is the prime mover enabling market cap and\ndividend rate to accelerate or decelerate as a pair. What is made obviously wrong\nwould be a thrift theory casting dividend restraint as the prime mover. Were that so,\nmarket cap acceleration would coincide with lower rather than higher dividend\nrates.\nThis pretty much completes my evidence for free growth theory. I have not found\nother promising data sources. One is tantalizingly close to hand. There is not much\nreason why corporate bond history is less transparent to the world than corporate\nstock history. A qualified expert might reconstruct market caps of both, side by side,\nto show a picture of the whole corporate sector. Surely I am not the only person who\nwould take interest. What is the history of leverage, and of total return, and its\ngrowth and yield components, to debt and equity claims cap-weighted together?\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 22\nIt would be nice to test from such a dataset, again starting from (4.6), to see if free\ngrowth theory holds again. Who knows? Meanwhile, I think, the case is closed. All\ngrowth at very large scales is free until proved otherwise.\nWhere Does Opinion Stand Now?\nWhat should we make of this evidence for free growth in national accounts and\nstock market data? Lawmakers would probably demand a recount or an\ninvestigation. Tax laws discourage consumption and dividends to encourage growth.\nYet data show that lower consumption rate coincides as often with lower as higher\ncapital growth rate for eight nations over four to fourteen decades. They will show\nthe same for dividends when we come to that.\nEconomists would be less surprised. Solow has prepared them for the news. In 1956\nand 1957 he showed evidence that most growth is not explained by capital\naccumulation, or saving through consumption restraint. His Nobel prize acceptance\nspeech in 1988 includes:\n… In the beginning, I was quite surprised at the relatively minor part the model\nascribed to capital formation. Even when this was confirmed by Denison and others,\nthe result seemed contrary to common sense. The fact that the steady-state rate of\ngrowth is independent of the investment quota was easy to understand; it only\nrequired thinking through the theory. It was harder to feel comfortable with the\nconclusion that even in the shorter run increased investment would do very little for\ntransitory growth. The transition to a higher equilibrium growth path seemed to\noffer very little leverage for policy aimed at promoting investment.\nThe formal model omitted one mechanism whose absence would clearly bias the\npredictions against investment. That is what I called “embodiment,” the fact that\nmuch technological progress, maybe most of it, could find its way into actual\nproduction only with the use of new and different capital equipment. Therefore the\neffectiveness of innovation in increasing output would be paced by the rate of gross\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 23\ninvestment. A policy to increase investment would thus lead not only to higher\ncapital intensity, which might not matter much, but also a faster transfer of new\ntechnology into actual production, which would. Steady-state growth would not be\naffected, but intermediate-run transitions would, and those should be observable.\nThat idea seemed to correspond to common sense, and it still does. By 1958 I was\nable to produce a model that allowed for the embodiment effect. … If common sense\nwas right, the embodiment model should have fit the facts better than the earlier\none. But it did not. Dension (1985) , whose judgment I respect, came to the\nconclusion that there was no explanatory value in the embodiment idea. I do not\nknow if that find should be described as a paradox, but it was at least a puzzle.\nEdward Denison was another leading growth economist Solow consulted.\nRemember that Solow had defined disembodied growth to mean better use of\nexisting assets, as when ships carrying coal to Newcastle are inspired to reverse the\nbusiness plan. It is easy to see how disembodied growth could come more or less for\nfree. But Solow puzzled how embodied growth, which needs “new and different\ncapital equipment,” could arrive without “ a policy to increase investment.”\nIt can for the same reason that Achilles can overtake the tortoise. Solow’s problem, I\nthink, may have been that new and different capital equipment stands to embodied\nnovelty as a new and different chicken laying a new and different egg. We can see\nhow the different capital might come first through saving from consumption\ndeferment. And it seems clear that the embodied novelty could not. But one of the\nbeauties of calculus is that it allows chicken and egg to evolve simultaneously.\nNeither novelty precedes the other at the instant of first embodiment.\nThis time it is Newton and Leibnitz to the rescue, along with the trusty Gunnar\nMyrdal, if I guess right about Solow’s misgivings. Since he understands calculus and\nMyrdal far better than I do, I may guess wrong. So let me try another way. It seems\nto me that embodied growth is still disembodied growth at a finer and more basic\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 24\nscale. Instead of redeploying finished goods, we recombine raw materials. We aren’t\ncreating something from nothing. And growth is not so free that it needs no cost at\nall. It still needs depreciation plowback. Net investment would mean any in addition.\nThe charts and tables, as I read them, show a steady stroke of deprecation plowback\npaying for all innovation, embodied or disembodied, that copes as best it can with\ngood times or bad.\nThe steady stroke metaphor, showing how cost (the steady stroke) and growth\n(against the shoreline) could be desynchronized, explains the possibility of free\ngrowth. It does not explain why the record shows no other kind. My best guess as an\nexplanation would look to biology. The biological imperative shapes our tastes and\nbehaviors for lineage survival in some sense of family or population or species.\nOther species crowd their niches. They cannot gain by consumption restraint for the\ntwo excellent reasons that there is no consumption to spare and no niche space if\nthere were.\nRicardo, Malthus and West all warned against rote replication in economies already\ndeveloped. We must create means to make more from less. I suspect that we are up\nagainst that wall more or less continually. Innovation pushes the wall back when\ngenius and happenstance are at their best, and helps us survive the rest of the time.\nIt costs the same either way. Consumption sacrifice is sacrifice to gods who work\ntheir will heedless of it.\nMy implication that we have no consumption to spare could mislead. Rather we\nhave none safe to spend. All creatures hold back reserves against adversity.\nEconomies usually carry more capital, producing more consumption, than they need\nfor now. It is a rainy day fund to be drawn down in lean times and built back in\nplush ones. Many nations invaded capital to keep up consumption during the world\nwars and world depression between, and reversed course since. But we would be\nfools to spend it for return over time when the next crisis might come tomorrow.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 25\nWhat exactly do I picture as this capital reserve? Is it vodka distilleries that might be\nconverted to orange juice plants in a pinch? I don’t really know. Human capital itself\nis versatile. Some retirees could unretire, and vodka plant workers might convert\nwith not much retraining. I will explore some of this idea later.\nHarrod’s Knife Edge\nSolow’s neoclassical growth model developed from ideas published a decade earlier\nby Roy Harrod. Harrod had described a “warranted growth path” given by the pace\nof technological innovation. He reasoned correctly that any effort to push\ninvestment faster must soon founder in the diminishing returns foreseen by Malthus,\nRicardo and West in 1815. But how could we get investment exactly right? There\nwas a critical “knife edge” with little margin for error. He was right to stress the\ndangers of overinvestment. I do the same. But free growth theory, and the\noverwhelming evidence that it is right, bring a new perspective.\nWhat Solow and other economists teach today , judging from the textbooks I read, is\nmore or less Harrod without the knife edge. We are taught to figure out the\nwarranted growth path, meaning the rate of technological growth, and then invest\njust enough, ex ante, to exceed depreciation by that margin. But my charts and tables\nshow that any investment beyond depreciation recovery is deadweight loss. There is\nno need to know the warranted growth path because optimum investment is not a\nfunction of whatever it might be. Depreciation investment captures the whole of\ntechnological growth, and further investment adds no more. It is money left on the\ntable. Optimum ex ante investment, at the collective scale, is depreciation\ninvestment. Ex post results will reveal the warranted growth path.\nWhat about Underinvestment?\nOne indication in the charts and tables might leave us puzzled. It is easy to\nunderstand the futility of ex ante investment (consumption restraint) beyond\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 26\ndepreciation plowback in light of the diminishing returns described by Ricardo,\nMalthus and West two centuries ago. We might crowd our niche, like other\ncreatures, and leave neither consumption safe to spare nor room for capital\naccumulation before diminishing returns set in. But too little investment could seem\na tougher challenge. No thrift at all, meaning not even depreciation plowback, would\nmean no growth at all. Then consumption rate would vary inversely as capital\nacceleration, just as predicted in in thrift theory. And underinvestment, meaning\nplowback of less than current cost depreciation, ought to happen about as often as\noverinvestment. If each year of underinvestment tended to fit the predictions of\nthrift theory even a little, free growth indexes should average something less than\none in the end. But they don’t. The index varies, but averages more than one as often\nas less in every country and period.\nThe explanation I suggest is already implied in that insight of two centuries ago. Just\nas overinvestment and capital glut diminish returns, underinvestment and capital\nshortage augment them until supply of capital catches up to demand. Even if there\nwere no plowback at all in some years, higher returns to capital already in place\nwould help take up the slack. There would be real danger in sustained\nunderinvestment or overinvestment. The saving grace is in market forces restoring\nequilibrium as investors maximize return.\nSummary\nThis gives the outline of free growth theory. It is my best speculation on how to\nmake sense of the charts and tables. It follows Mill more or less exactly, and risks\nthe next step in the bold new direction pointed by Solow.\nMy prize exhibits are the charts and tables. Better this book should show them alone,\nwith an explanation of my testing equations and the data sources, than all the rest\nwithout them. They could hardly support free growth theory better than if Mill and I\nhad rigged them. The consequences are huge. We must get rid of the corporate\ndouble tax ASAP, and raise the corporate tax rate enough to make the overall\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 27\nadjustment revenue-neutral. That should help get both parties on board. We must\ntax capital gains at the same rate as ordinary income. Dividend rates should revert\nto the 4% - 6% range typical over the centuries before the pro-investment policies\nput in place after World War II. We must do whatever we can to level the\nconsumption-investment playing field.\nObvious qualifiers are worth spelling out. (4.1) and all consequences are meant to\ndescribe at the collective scale, where growth cannot be explained by transfer. Free\ngrowth theory assumes depreciation investment, not zero investment. My charts\nand tables will never be exact. There are inevitably errors and judgment biases in\nthe national accounts and research assembled by Piketty and Zucman, more added\nby them, and more by me. These cautions will apply to later chapters as well.\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 28\nCHAPTER 5: BRINGING HUMAN CAPITAL IN\nHuman capital is labor measured as a dollar sum rather than as so much per hour or\nyear. It treats pay less invested consumption as our cash flow, and finds our present\nvalue (to ourselves) as expected lifetime cash flow discounted by our own time\npreference rates, meaning what we would charge for delay. Measurement in this\nway usually finds it as something near three fourths of all capital. Physical capital,\nmuch better understood because it can be bought and sold as well as hired, is only\nthe visible tip of the iceberg. The term human capital itself is touchy because it can\nsuggest that life has a price. Irving Fisher used it in quotation marks in 1898 1 ,\nattributing it to earlier sources I haven’t found, but not in his two great books on the\ntopic in 1906 2 and 1907 3 . Wikipedia is mistaken in attributing the term to Arthur\nPigou a generation later.\nHistory of the Idea\nThe concept began with Petty in 1664 4 . He estimated the aggregate pay of English\nworkers, and divided by the discount rate he had modeled in A Treatise of Taxes two\nyears earlier. I have not read Verbum Sapienti, but have read two of his later\nversions of the same argument 5 .\nPetty’s method was criticized by William Farr in 1854 6 , also in a paper I haven’t read,\nfor neglecting what I call invested consumption. Farr, if I read the right description\nof his argument, was both right and wrong. Petty was modeling human capital of\naggregate workers. These were mostly adults, who no longer receive invested\nconsumption if my model is right. That makes his method sound in principle for\nmeasuring adult human capital separately. It follows that he underestimated the\nhuman capital of England, rather than overestimating it as Farr claimed, by leaving\n1 The Nature of Capital.\n2 The Nature of Capital and Income.\n3 The Rate of Interest.\n4 Verbum Sapienti.\n5 Political Arithmetic (1676) and A Gross Estimate of the Wealth of England (1685).\n6 Vital Statistics.\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 1\nout the human capital of children. But Farr deserves credit for pointing out that\nhuman capital in general capitalizes pay less invested consumption.\nKeynes’ teacher Alfred Marshall agreed with Farr in 1990 7 . As I read this passage,\nMarshall interpreted maintenance consumption as investment. So did B. F. Kiker 8 in\n1968. I interpret it as exhaust in taste satisfaction enabling energy to earn pay\nconcurrently, while preserving but not increasing pay expectations in future.\nInvested consumption would mean addition to human capital concurrently for\nexpected realization with interest in higher pay later.\nMeanwhile economists had developed the complementary idea of human capital as\npresent cost of investment accumulated before. Adam Smith 9 in 1776 wrote\n…The acquisition of such talents, by the maintenance of the acquirer during\nhis education, study, or apprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is\na capital fixed and realized, as it were, in his person.\nThe conversion of some consumption into human capital was a favorite theme of\nFrank Knight a generation before Schultz. Only the rest is what Schultz called pure\nconsumption eliminated from the economy in satisfying tastes. Becker added in\n1964 that this investment must be expected to be recovered with interest, at least\nwhen paid by employers in job training. Schultz had also pointed out that human\ncapital depreciates, and invests some work in itself in the effort of learning to\ncomplement the exterior investment of nurture and schooling. Ben-Porath,\nexpressing a Schultz-led consensus, added in 1967 that human capital growth is\ninvested consumption (the nurture and schooling) plus self-invested work less\nhuman depreciation. All these ideas are now accepted everywhere in human capital\nstudies.\n7 Principles of Economics.\n8 A History of Human Capital. I learned of Farr from Kiker.\n9 The Wealth of Nations.\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 2\nJacob Mincer seems to have been first in print with the post-war revival of interest\nin human capital, in his 1958 paper 10 rederiving Irving Fisher’s present value\nequation and stressing job training. Schultz impresses me as the main idea man\namong these post-war contributors. He usually avoided math, unlike the others, and\nis probably the best source for quotes in plain English. His paper Investment in\nHuman Capital, published in 1961, includes:\n… Much of what we call consumption constitutes investment in human capital.\nDirect expenditures on education, health and internal migration to take advantage\nof better job opportunities are clear examples. Earnings foregone by mature\nstudents attending school and by workers acquiring on-the-job training are equally\nclear examples.\n… This use of leisure time to improve skills and knowledge is widespread… I shall\ncontend that such investment in human capital accounts for most of the impressive\nrise in the real earnings per worker…\n… Measured by what labor contributes to output, the productive capacity of human\nbeings is now vastly larger than all other forms of wealth taken together…\n… the curve relating income to age trends to be steeper for skilled than for unskilled\npersons. Investment in on-the-job training seems a likely explanation…\n… We can think of three classes of expenditures: expenditures that satisfy human\npreferences and in no way enhance the capabilities under discussion – these\nrepresent pure consumption; expenditures that enhance capabilities and do not\nsatisfy any preference underlying consumption – these represent pure investment;\nand expenditures that … are … partly consumption and partly investment, …\nIn 1962 11 he added:\n… the investment in human capital can conveniently be classified in (1) nurture and\nhigher education, (2) postschool training and learning, (3) preschool learning\nactivities, (4) migration, (5) health, (6) information, and (7) investment in children\n(population) …\n10 Investment in Human Capital and Personal Income Distribution\n11 Human Capital: Policy Issues and Research Opportunities\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 3\n… But unlike the wonderful “one-hoss shay,” the productive life of educational\ncapital typically does not go to pieces all at once. It depreciates along the way, it\nbecomes obsolete, it is altered by changes in retirement and by the state of\nemployment …\n… As already noted, educational capital, like reproducible physical capital, is subject\nto depreciation and obsolescence. The established tax treatment takes account of\nboth depreciation and obsolescence in the case of physical capital, but this\naccounting is not extended to education capital… In brief, our tax laws… appear to\nbe all but blind to the fact that educational capital entrails maintenance and\ndepreciation, becomes obsolete, and disappears at death…\nThese excerpts clearly show Shultz’ meanings of pure and invested consumption,\nand of human deprecation. He says “pure investment” in place of my “invested\nconsumption”, but I prefer to follow tradition by applying “invested” to physical\ncapital alone. We also see his belief, with which I disagree, that substantial invested\nconsumption continues after independence and physical maturity. For example, he\nwrites “Direct expenditures on … health and internal migration … are clear\nexamples.” I interpret these outlays, when applied to adult workers, as maintenance\nconsumption preserving rather than adding skills, and enabling current pay rather\nthan invested for higher pay later.\nI agree that self-invested work “to improve skills and knowledge … accounts for\nmost of the impressive rise in the real earnings per worker …”. But I don’t share\nSchultz’ view that the “use of leisure time” accounts for much of this improvement.\nMy years in plants and oilfields and offices have given me an impression of some\nstudy by workers during leisure time, but mostly passive accumulation of\nexperience and insight while fully at work on the job.\nPractical Uses\nOne obvious use of the human capital idea is to compare the factors (human and\ntradeable capital) in the same dimension. Capital and labor cannot be added, as\nPetty knew, since capital is measured in dollars where labor is measured in dollars\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 4\nper unit time. But Petty showed that the idea of human capital as discounted cash\nflow measured in a money sum allows the factors to be summed together. The\nrevival of interest at the Chicago school soon introduced the term physical capital\nfor land and man-made things that can be bought and sold, and total capital for the\nsum. Physical capital is a misnomer in that we are physical too. But I have used it\nthroughout so that economists can follow me and general readers can pick up some\nof their language.\nFrom the Y = C + I Equation to the Y Rule\nChapter 2 summarized my argument adjusting the Y = C + I equation to the Y rule.\nChapter 4 spelled out the former in (4.1). The Y rule made the hidden asterisks of\nthe Y = C + I equation explicit. I said in both chapters that the free growth equations\nare the same for both when we allow for the asterisks.\nLet’s go through the derivation of the Y rule again. (4.1) shows\noutput = investment + consumption.\nI generally mean the version of this where “ex post net” is understood before both\n“output” and “investment”. I said that this idea is implicit in the Mill quote, and is\nprobably as old as economics. Net output, here or anywhere, means creation of\nvalue. Then the equation would be guaranteed by the truism, at the collective scale,\nif net investment meant growth of all value existing, meaning total capital, while\nconsumption meant elimination from total capital collectively and nothing else. But\nnet ex post investment as meant throughout this book, and anywhere in macro,\nmeans growth in physical capital alone. Consumption includes Schultz’ invested\nconsumption transferred into human capital as well as his pure consumption\neliminated from total capital as a whole. What the truism guarantees is rather\noutput = total growth + pure consumption, (5.1)\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 5\nat the collective scale and where “ex post net” is again understood before “output.”\n(5.1), but not (4.1), guarantees that terms are mutually exclusive and exhaustive.\nTotal growth means this ex post net investment (growth of physical capital) plus\ngrowth of human capital. The latter would have puzzled us before the contribution\nof Ben-Porath. Equation (4) in his 1967 paper, summarizing the first three, shows\nhuman growth = invested consumption + self-invested work\n– human depreciation, (5.2)\nusing my terms rather than his.\nChapter 6 will argue that this equation needs to be clarified. I gave a preview in\nChapter 2, and will update it now. Work is the output of human capital. Output is not\nalways positive. It is negative whenever growth and cash flow sum to less than zero.\nA negative sum of these two shows unrecovered decapitalition (also called\ndeadweight loss). That would include unrecovered human depreciation. If (5.2)\nmeant all including negative self-invested work less all including unrecovered\nhuman depreciation, it would subtract unrecovered human depreciation twice. Then\nit must be corrected either to\nhuman growth = invested consumption + positive self-invested work\n− human depreciation, (5.3)\nor equivalently\nhuman growth = invested consumption + self-invested work\n− recovered human depreciation.\n(5.3a)\nIt is clear that Ben-Porath meant (5.3), as other evidence shows that he treated\nhuman depreciation as unrecovered. So does all tradition, mistakenly I believe, with\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 6\nthe partial exception of Becker. I will generally prefer (5.3a), although the two are\nidentical in meaning.\nSchultz’ analysis of consumption found\nconsumption = invested consumption + pure consumption. (5.4)\nThis plus (5.1) and (5.3a) combine for\noutput = total growth + pure consumption\n= investment + human growth + pure consumption\n= investment + invested consumption + self-invested work\n– recovered human depreciation + pure consumption\n= investment + invested consumption + self-invested work\n– recovered human depreciation + consumption\n– invested consumption\n= investment + consumption + self-invested work\n– recovered human depreciation. (5.5)\n“Ex post net”, as always, should be understood before both “output” and\n“investment”.\nChapter 6 will revisit this logic once again, and add a second way to the same\nconclusion.\nThe Growth Equation Under the Y Rule\n(5.1) can be arranged as\ntotal growth = output – pure consumption,\n(5.1a)\nas a counterpart to (4.1a). Total growth means growth in total capital. My argument\ncontinues as in Chapter 4. Since (4.2) was a blind alley, skip to (4.3). That now\nbecomes\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 7\ntotal growth\ntotal capital = output\ntotal capital − pureconsumption , (5.6)\ntotal capital\nwhich can be written as\ntotal growth rate = total capital productivity\n− pure consumption rate,\n(5.6a)\nas with (4.3a). Since (5.6a) is always true, and not only under occasional\ncircumstances, we also get\nchange in total growth rate = change in total capital productivity\n− change in pure consumption rate. (5.7)\nThis parallels the logic of (4.4). Again save space by reexpressing this as\ntotal acceleration = total productivity + total thrift,\n(5.7a)\nwhere “total” means “of total capital”. Now divide by total acceleration to reach the\ncounterparts of (4.5) and (4.5a).\nI will sometimes save space, from now on, by expressing these arguments in the\nequations of Chapter 4, as for example in leaving the words “total” and “pure”\nimplicit if the context shows that I mean them.\nThe Slave Paradox\nSay that Phil enslaves Bill. Bill’s maintenance consumption had been taste-satisfying\npure consumption to Bill when Bill was free, and so was not deducted from his pay\nto find his gross realized output as valued by himself. But Bill’s maintenance\nconsumption satisfies no tastes of Phil. Cash flow is gross realized output less\nplowback from revenue less new investment from outside, for either factor, while\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 8\nnet output is gross realized output less depreciation plus proprietary output. Both\ndrop by the amount of Bill’s maintenance consumption on Phil’s books as a\nslaveowner. So then does Bill’s present value of that cash flow.\nThis noir thought experiment is worth thinking through. It shows that even if\nslavery were legal and common, its market evidence would neither show the value\nof human capital nor refute the fact that human capital is inalienable. It is\ninalienable for the reason, if none other, that our maintenance consumption satisfies\nno one else’s tastes. Phil did not acquire Bill’s human capital. He converted it to\nlivestock worth much less.\nAnother useful point is that assets in general tend to be worth more to their owners.\nThis does not contradict the convergence axioms. We buy or build to taste. That\ndifference is particularly important as to assets not meant to be traded, such as\nproductive plant. I suspect that this is what the national accounts missed in\nadjusting depreciation.\nMaintenance Learning\nBen-Porath argued, persuasively I believe, that both kinds of investment in human\ncapital must end when not enough time remains for recovery with interest. Those\ntwo are invested consumption, including schooling, and self-invested work. I\npropose that invested consumption substantially ends at maturity and\nindependence. Self-invested work of learning continues long after, as there remains\nno other adequate explanation of age-wage profiles. When does it stop?\nLearning itself continues to the end. Yet if Ben-Porath is right, and he is, selfinvested\nlearning stops well before. What continues, I think, is what I call\n“maintenance learning”. It is defined as learning to keep up pay now rather than to\nenhance pay later. At all ages, we must learn the names and traits of new clients and\nco-workers and suppliers and regulations continually to do what we are paid for.\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 9\nThis observation helps clarify my hypothesis that job learning costs no time that\nmight otherwise have been spent earning pay. My deeper meaning is that invested\nlearning and maintenance learning are the same process costing the same time but\nwith different economic effect, much as with invested and maintenance\nconsumption.\nEvidence that hourly if not yearly pay rises until retirement, or very near, would\nrefute Ben-Porath’s claim if human capital ended at retirement. But it continues\nthrough retirement because imputed pay does.\nMill and a few economists before him acknowledged “productive” and\n“unproductive” consumption. The productive kind was what I call maintenance and\ninvested consumption. Unproductive consumption meant any written invested for\nhigher pay later nor supporting survival pay now. That would give\npure consumption = maintenance consumption + unproductive consumption (5.8)\nand\nconsumption = invested consumption + pure consumption\n= invested consumption + maintenance consumption\n+ unproductive consumption. (5.9)\nInvestment and maintenance contrast in human capital as in a firm. Investment is\nvalued only in the expectation of future maintenance. No maintenance later, no\nvalue now. To count maintenance as new investment would count part of the old\ninvestment twice. Where the accounting treatments differ is in disposition.\nMaintenance in the firm is recovered in pay and products. I thought before that the\nsame was true of human capital. Thanks to the parable of the boss and her secretary,\nI now I think it is exhausted in satisfying our taste for lineage survival.\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 10\nRestating the Three Fourths Rule\nPetty, neglecting human capital of children, measured total capital as about 2.5\ntimes physical capital in 1664. Most estimates since have run higher. I myself model\n4:1 or so as a first approximation. The ratio of human to physical capital might hold\nto some such lasting norm for the same reason that number of shepherds should\nhold in proportion to number of sheep. They own as many as they can manage.\nHuman capital means value of skills, including skills in acquiring and employing\nphysical capital. If the value of physical capital changes, so should the value of its\nmanagement. There is truth behind the old doctrine that a rise in the productivity of\nlabor explains growth in value of physical capital. But old skills can also be more in\ndemand when improvements in physical capital productivity can get more good out\nof them. Drivers are worth more when there is more valuable freight to be trucked.\nA rise in either kind of capital tends to invite a rise in the other.\nThe ratio of pure to invested consumption is unsettled in human capital studies. I\njust showed why I think Schultz gave the right clue in 1961 when he defined\ninvested consumption as an outlay to be recovered with interest in consumption\nover the future, and pure consumption as an outlay bringing taste satisfaction now.\nIt is the same distinction as with investment and operating expense in the firm. A\nprofessional’s meals and doctor bills, and even his subscription to trade journals, are\nexpenses needed to keep his earning power intact rather than investment to raise it\nover the future. It seems to me that once we are physically mature, the only avenues\nof investment in skill building, not exhuast in skill maintenance, are self-invested\nwork and job training or other adult education.\nAnd I argued that there is probably not much adult education. Only a few go back to\nschool. From what I’ve seen, job training is concentrated in our first few months\nwhen schooling is over and full-time work begins. That’s why I think that the rise of\npay with age, implying a rise in skills marketed, is explained more or less entirely by\nself-invested work in the mainly subliminal accumulation of job experience. (Work\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 11\nmeans the output of human capital, and nothing in the definition of output implies\neffort or even awareness.)\nI agree with Ben-Porath that all consumption and all work should be modeled as\nself-invested until independence and full-time job entry, given that models must\nsimplify. But I just showed why I model all consumption after, or anyhow after a few\nmonths of job training, as Schultz’ pure kind. Here I would fault Mincer and his pupil\nBecker, but not Schultz or Ben-Porath, for too much focus on the potential of job\ntraining. It exists and is crucial. But it is so small a fraction of invested consumption,\njudging from my experience, that I prefer to neglect it in modeling. Job learning,\nconversely, seems to explain all rise in pay with age.\nBiology might predict the same. Nature’s plan is that we first develop and then\nreproduce. Some creatures follow sharply-defined somatic and reproductive phases\nshowing first only development and then only reproduction. A mature butterfly\ndoes not eat. It may even lose mouth parts. Its time is spent in reproduction alone.\nOther creatures including us like eating too, but nature gives them that taste for the\nsake of the one behind. Adult consumption, as I see it, is more or less all pure\nconsumption exhausted from total capital in satisfying our taste for life and energy.\nConsumption by the young is invested because that is the big idea. Nature’s plan is\nreproduction to maturity.\nNow suppose for simplicity that consumption is age-independent. Nobelists Milton\nFriedman and Franco Modigliani, mentioned earlier for their opposite reactions to\nmy banking idea, separately argued something like that in the 1950s for adults. My\nextension backward to birth seems defensible when we remember to include\nunpaid parental care and then schooling in invested consumption. I model human\ncapital as continuing after retirement as present value of implicit pay by ourselves\nand others for caring for ourselves and those others. Then if adulthood runs from\nages 20 to 80, those simplifying assumptions would give pure consumption as three\nfourths of all consumption.\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 12\nI also modeled human capital as three fourths of total capital. My tag for the two\nideas together was the “three fourths rule.” The agreement of the two ratios as\nmodeled is a convenient coincidence. If they differed, this book would have to be a\nfew sentences longer. Each is first-order approximation only.\nThe Free Growth Index for Total Capital\nGiven the three fourths rule, the free growth index for total capital is derived by\nreading “pure” and “total” before the words consumption and capital in the\nequations of Chapter 4.\nNow back to the charts and tables. The free growth index for total capital is tracked\nin the red line and labeled !\nϕ(Kt). It too fluctuates around one in each country, but in\na much narrower range than does the blue line !\nϕ(K). The reason is the three\nfourths rule. The thrift index, not shown in the charts and tables, is one minus the\nfree growth index. It is derived in Chapter 4 as thrift rate over acceleration, where\nthrift rate is change in consumption/capital ratio times minus one. By the three\nfourths rule, where pure consumption is three fourths of all consumption while total\ncapital is four times physical capital, the pure consumption/total capital ratio is only\n3/16 (3/4 divided by 4) the size of the consumption/physical capital ratio. The\nyearly changes in these ratios reflected in the numerator of the thrift index will hold\nto the same proportion. The denominator is acceleration, which is always the same\nfor physical as total capital by the assumption that they hold in 1:4 proportion\nthroughout. This explains why the unshown thrift index, or numerator over\ndenominator, is automatically 3/16 as large for total as for physical capital, and why\nthe shown free growth index runs nearer one in consequence.\nI have just given an idea why it can be worthwhile to brush up the algebra we all\nlearned in high school or before, and to suffer the nuisance of mathematical notation.\nI have made a very simple truth, obvious in hindsight, seem complicated by making\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 13\ndo with words alone. One less something nearer zero, whether that something (the\nthrift index) is positive or negative, is nearer one. The wonderful books of Einstein\n(with Enfeld) and Steven Hawking, not to mention Mill, show that even calculus can\nbe put that way. My task has been to follow their tough act. But I will now start to\ninfiltrate notation where I think that that form of shorthand should help more then\nit hurts.\nSummary\nThe data for the free growth index of total capital ϕ(Kt) in the charts and tables do\nnot represent a separate test. It is the same test adjusted to the three fourths rule.\nThat was proposed as a convenient rule of thumb. I would have shown a true\nseparate test if I knew how. Pure consumption might become separately measurable\nsome day, but human capital will not. The Phil and Bill parable shows that not even\nevidence from slave markets would be on point. Human capital has no possible\nvalue to any but its original owner.\nWhether in words or notation, I hope to make the point that Chapter 4 and the\ncharts and tables showing !\nϕ(K)are likely to understate the case for Mill. Those\nshowing should be nearer the truth. Physical capital and pure consumption\n! ϕ(K ) T\nare less than the whole. My three fourths rule will never be exact because reality\ncares little for the convenience of modelers. Proportions between the kinds of\nconsumption will not hold exactly constant and will never exactly agree. But I don’t\nthink the three fourths rule is so wrong that the real value of ϕ(K ! T\n)doesn’t run\nnearer one than the real value of !\nϕ(K). (The infiltration begins.)\nThen the data support free growth theory convincingly enough if we trust equation\n(4.1), as do all macroeconomists as far as I know, and probably more convincingly\nwhen human capital is considered too.\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 14\nThe cautions at the end of Chapter 4 apply even more. My charts and tables for\n! ϕ(K ) repeat the accumulated error and bias of those for T !\nϕ(K), and add the crude\nsimplification of the three fourths rule. (5.4) expresses my understanding of what\nBen-Porath means in equation (4) in his 1967 paper, where variables are defined in\nhis three equations before. If (5.4) doesn’t capture his idea faithfully, it anyhow\ncaptures mine. Likewise my (5.5) may or may not do justice to Schultz. Some but not\nall possible interpretations of what he might have meant give (5.5). Again, it is my\nbelief whether or not his.\nWhat Farr, Marshall and Kiker have shown, by deducting both invested and\nmaintenance consumption from pay to get adult cash flow discounted to present\nvalue, is human livestock value to a slaveowner. It is very little. The parable of Phil\nand Bill argued that Bill’s maintenance is expensed on Phil’s books, but treated as\nnet output and positive cash flow on Bill’s. I said I can’t prove that from axioms and\ndefinitions so far, and will need the biological imperative.\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 15\nCHAPTER 6: PARALLELS WITH THE FIRM\nMy Own History with These Ideas\nFor sheer shock value, at least to economists, the pay rule and the Y rule must count\nfirst amount the surprises I promised. Who would have thought that human\ndepreciation is expected to be recovered in revenue (pay) and product value just as\nwith plant depreciation? Heresy! Yet nothing is more easily proved. Either the\nmaximand rule or the deadweight loss rule is enough.\nFree growth theory and next generation theory give more scope and policy\nimplications. But the pay and Y rules have plenty of those, and may be new to the\nworld. Mill and Petty beat me to the others.\nI have been arguing the pay and Y rules from the time I reversed course from\nQuesnay’s idea some five years ago. I will rederive both in new ways at the end of\nthis chapter. My change of mind was a classical epiphany. I had been resisting the\nobvious for years. I showed how my parable of the boss and her secretary got me on\ntrack.\nMy depreciation theory is a lesser shock. It occurred to me over the Christmas\nholidays this year. It contradicts the national accounts, whose Capital Consumption\nAdjustment corrects book depreciation from linear to exponentially falling. That\nwould make depreciation fastest at the start, and progressively less. No one has\nobjected because practical experience seems to say the same. If we resell a new car\nor house after only a few months of use, we take a big hit. If we resell a new factory,\nwhich would have been tailored to our unique business plan, we take a bigger one.\nMy counter-argument is that premature resale reflects adverse selection. The usual\nmotive for premature trade is bad news and pressure to sell, not pressure from\nothers to buy.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 1\nI point instead to the millions who don’t sell. I argue that depreciation and\namortization are the same in essence. Loan payments are all interest at the start,\nand all amortization at the end, by inference from the present value rule.\nMy risk theory is a mini-surprise. It shifts focus from the risk of the asset to the risk\naversion of the owner. Another mini-surprise is the feature of my growth truism\npointing out that deadweight loss means negative unrealized output.\nI will revisit these topics in more depth after I cover the necessary groundwork in\ncomparing the accountancy for human capital and the firm.\nAssets, Owners and Revenue\nAssets means examples of capital of either factor. Their owners are all members of\nthe reproducing population assumed in the axioms. Each, from newborns up, owns\nhuman capital at least. Value and growth and cash flow and output are properties of\ncapital. Tastes, aims and ends are properties of owners. Human capital reads its\nowner’s aims, and manages both factors to realize them. Positive cash flow is\noutflow from assets to owners, to exhaust or reinvest or give away as they like. In\nthe last two cases, the owner is mediating transfer out. She also mediates transfer in\nfrom reinvestment or gift received.\nThink of capital as source and present value of foreseen cash flows. Owners are the\nforeseers, the recipients of positive cash flows, the exhausters of some in taste\nsatisfaction, the deciders of the time preference rates giving present value, and the\nmediators of transfer out and transfer in (negative cash flow). In the case of the\ndiamond ring, the psychic positive cash flow arrived without mechanics. The more\ntypical case reaches the same outcome indirectly.\n(Net) output of an asset is its value added, or creation of value. Output can be\nrealized as outflow to owners for reinvestment or gift or exhaust, or it can be left in\nas growth. The part left in is proprietary or unrealized or self-invested output.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 2\nOutflow to owners can also include decapitalization from capital already in place, as\nin withdrawals from a bank account. I say decapitization, rather than depreciation,\nbecause the appropriate term might rather be amortization or depletion or\nliquidation in sale, depending on circumstances and the nature of the asset. The sum\nof the realized output and decapitalization can be called “gross cash flow”, meaning\ngross before deducting plowback and negative cash flow (transfer in). Then\ngross cash flow = cash flow + plowback + transfer in\n= realized output + recovered decapitalization. (6.1)\nHere I specify recovered decaptalization because I treat deadweight loss as\ndecapitalization too. Cash flow as accountants and businessmen use the term\nusually means gross of plowback, although net of transfer in. My meaning, net of\nboth, is the one always applied in finding total return and present value.\nAlthough cash flow might be in kind as well, I will follow convention by treating it as\nif realized from sale in cash. The owner can then spend the revenue on exhaust\n(pure consumption) or reinvestment or gift as she likes, but might also plow some\nor all back into the originating asset. The general principle is\npositive cash flow = gross cash flow – plowback. (6.2)\nIn simple cases, revenue measures and equals gross cash flow for each asset. But\nrevenue as the term is actually used is likelier to sum contributions from many\nassets and owners. To keep that usual meaning separate, define this asset’s share as\n“earned revenue”. Then\ngross cash flow = earned revenue. (6.3)\nAnother way to put the same idea is\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 3\nrevenue = collective gross cash flow = collective earned revenue (6.4)\nfrom all contributors to revenue together. Then revenue and earned revenue would\nbe the same if there are no other claims.\nEarned Revenue and Cash Flow\nA classical illustration of revenue generated collaboratively is the firm. The firm\nproper can be interpreted as a single asset of physical capital. Its typically many\nowners agree to hire outside management, meaning outside themselves, to contract\nand trade on their behalf. The firm through its managers hires the other employees,\ncontracts with suppliers, and generates a joint product representing all its own\ngross cash flow plus any contributed parts of gross cash flow of others. The product\nis sold for revenue in the collective sense. Revenue is first applied to satisfy claims\non it by those outside contributors. Claims recovered include current purchases\nfrom suppliers realized in sales. Others are pay to management and other\nemployees, along with rent, interest, utilities, other services, and whatever is due to\nthe tax man. The principle is to include all outlays by the firm needed to secure\nrevenue now, as distinct from outlays invested for the sake of more revenue later.\nThe share of revenue due the firm proper is any residue after all those prior claims\nare met. Then\ngross cash flow = revenue – prior claims = earned revenue (6.5)\ngives the contribution of the firm proper.\nEarned revenue may or may not be passed to owners. Management is typically\nauthorized to plow back any part as reinvestment, say in replenishing inventory or\ncash or in buying new plant and equipment. Any revenue left over after that\nplowback is transferred out to owners as dividend yield.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 4\nNegative cash flow, or transfer in, always means new investment added from\noutside. Plowback from revenue is excluded, as it is already recognized as a\ndeduction from positive cash flow. For the firm, the only source of positive cash flow\nis proceeds from new shares issued. With this understood,\nwhere\ncash flow = gross cash flow – plowback – transfer in\n= earned revenue – plowback – transfer in\n= positive cash flow – negative cash flow, (6.6)\npositive cash flow = earned revenue – plowback, and\nnegative cash flow = transfer in. (6.7)\nFirms use the term gross realized output to mean the same thing as what I call gross\ncash flow. A common definition is\ngross realized output = realized output + depreciation.\nNow we come to the subtle point allowing for deadweight loss. The total return\ntruism shows that output equals value growth plus cash flow. Then output is\nnegative wherever the sum of growth and cash flow is less than zero. Natural\ndisasters and bad investments can make them so. Those unexpected setbacks are\nexamples of deadweight loss. It amounts to unrecovered depreciation, meaning\ndepreciation not recovered (realized) in positive cash flow. I’ll get back to that soon.\nThe point at present is that the equation above really means\ngross realized output = realized output + recovered depreciation.\nHere too I prefer the generality of “decapitalization” over “depreciation”, and define\ngross realized output = gross cash flow\n= realized output + recovered decapitalization\n= earned revenue + recovered decapitalizaton. (6.8)\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 5\nThe terms gross cash flow, earned revenue and gross realized output will be used\ninterchangeably. “Realized” and “recovered” will likewise be synonymous, as will be\n“proprietary”, “unrealized” and self-invested”.\n(A6.1) allows\nrealized output = cash flow + plowback + transfer in\n– recovered decapitalizaiton. (6.1a)\nDefine\nunrealized output\n= output – realized output\n= growth + cash flow – realized output\n= growth – plowback – transfer in\n+ recovered decapitalization, (6.9)\nby (6.1a) and the total return truism.\nProprietary Output and Deadweight Loss\nUnrealized or proprietary or self-invested output of the firm is creation of value not\nyet sold or not meant to be sold. This can be something as workaday and\nperfunctory and automatic as output to inventory. Other illustrations could be\nwhere a construction firm builds its own offices, or a car manufacturer makes cars\nfor its executive fleet. (6.9) shows that it includes all growth not explained by\nplowback plus transfer in less recovered decapitalization. This implicitly includes all\nfree growth. Judging from my charts and tables, free growth seems to mean all of\ngrowth at the collective scale. What effect might it have on the firm?\nFree growth includes random windfall gain and deadweight loss as well as the\noverall upward trend expressing new ideas. Deadweight loss is unrecovered\ndecapitalization, meaning not recovered in cash flow, That makes it negative output\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 6\nas the sum of growth and cash flow, and specifically negative unrealized output.\nThen\ndeadweight loss = unrecovered decapitalization\n= negative output\n= negative unrealized output\n= max (0, – output)\n= max (0, − unrealized output). (6.10)\nAlso\npositive unrealized output = max (0, proprietary output), (6.11)\nand\noutput = unrealized output + realized output. (6.12)\nThe Growth Truism\nIn general,\nHere\nAlso\ngrowth = capitalization from outside + capitalization from inside\n– decapitalization. (6.13)\ncapitalization from outside = negative cash flow = transfer in, and\ncapitalization from inside = positive unrealized output + plowback.\nThen\ndecapitalization = recovered decapitalization + unrecovered decapitalization\n= recovered decapitalization + deadweight loss.\ngrowth = transfer in + positive unrealized output + plowback\n– recovered decapitalization – deadweight loss, (6.14)\nor more simply\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 7\ngrowth = transfer in + positive unrealized output + plowback\n− decapitalization.\n(6.14a)\n(6.14a) can also be expressed as\ngrowth = transfer in + unrealized output + plowback\n− recovered decapitalization.\n(6.14b)\nFor convenience, define\ngross transfer in = transfer in + plowback,\nSo that (6.14) through (6.14b) can be put more compactly as\ngrowth = gross transfer in + positive proprietary output – decapitalizaiton\n= transfer in + unrealized output – recovered decapitalization. (6.14c)\nAny of these versions of (6.14) can be called the growth truism. The new term gross\ntransfer in will help shorten equations for human capital.\nManagement as a Quasi-Owner\nOwners (shareholders) typically allow management wide latitude to cope with\nneeds. It stands in place of owners. Accounting tradition, and this book too, reasons\nout the steps from revenue to dividend yield as if management itself were the owner.\nOtherwise there would be little to say. From the shareholder viewpoint, revenue is\nsimply dividend yield.\nBut the bottom line is the same. The maximand is output, or growth plus cash flow.\nPositive cash flow, in the sense net of plowback, is dividend yield on both the firm’s\nbooks and the shareholder’s. Negative cash flow on the books of shareholders\nindividually is purchase of any shares in the same firm. On the books of\nshareholders collectively, where sales and purchases of existing shares offset, it\nsimplifies to purchase of new stock issues alone. This too is just as on the books of\nthe firm.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 8\nMy purpose in this analysis of the firm has been to derive equations valid for any\ncapital of either factor. The firm is a good model for several reasons. Its accounting\ntraditions are centuries old, and have been well thought through. It is rich in\npossibilities because it has to be. It must describe firms of many kinds. It must allow\nfor contingencies whether or not they apply. For many simple assets, say the firm’s\nshares as opposed to itself, revenue and positive cash flow can be the same. But the\ncomplexity and versatility of the firm itself, and the person-likeness added by its\ninternal management, make it a useful model for any and all capital of either factor.\nNot that I claim to follow accounting tradition closely, or even to understand it\nclosely. I am even less an accountant than an economist. My terms and concepts\ntend to be idiosyncratic. The main thing is for the logic to hold together.\nHuman Capital by Analogy to the Firm\nIt is reasonable to define pay as the revenue of human capital. Earned revenue for\nthe firm is typically less than revenue. There are prior claims to offset contribution\nby worker and suppliers. The counterpart in human capital, I said in Chapter 2, is\nmaintenance consumption. I believed for years that this cost counted as a prior\nclaim on pay, just as with the firm. I may have been the only person to think so since\nQuesnay and the physiocrats, although Mill and Sraffa might be interpreted that way.\nBut who has thought what doesn’t matter. Quesnay’s idea is a mathematical\npossibility that must be addressed. I’ll get there soon.\nHuman capital is inalienable. That means that its decapitalization simplifies to\nhuman depreciation. The firm’s added possibilities of depletion and liquidation\ndon’t apply. The output of human capital is called work. Then (6.1) through (6.8),\napplied to human capital, give\nearned revenue = pay – prior claims\n= gross realized work\n= realized work + recovered human depreciation. (6.15)\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 9\nThe pay rule argues that prior claims are zero and that all human depreciation is\nexpected to be recovered in pay and work products as a norm.\nChapter 2 offered two logical proofs of the second point. The alternative to recovery\nis deadweight loss. Capital is discounted foreseen cash flow, and cash flow is\nrealization in transfer or taste satisfaction. Deadweight loss, or unrealized\ndepcatialization, is therefore implicitly unforeseen. Human depreciation, like plant\ndepreciation, is foreseen from the start. Aging and mortality come as no surprise. It\nis therefore foreseen as realized in pay.\nThe second proof, stated in part by Becker, follows from the maximand rule. All\nbehavior is maximization of perceived risk-adjusted return to the individual’s total\ncapital. This follows from definitions, not from axioms. There are no exceptions\nbecause there are no square circles. The rule says that no one invests in anything\nwithout expected recovery with interest. Recovery means recovery of depreciation.\nWe do invest in human capital, of ourselves and our children, and consequently\nexpect recovery of human depreciation by ourselves or them. It’s that simple.\nOther proofs looked to evidence and experience. I offered the parable of the boss\nand her secretary, which had been decisive in converting me from Quesnay’s view.\nLet’s go through it once more. Assume that investment in each has ended before the\nlast year for each. First take the possibility that neither maintenance consumption\n(the supposed prior claims) nor human depreciation is recovered in pay. Then work\nand cash flow for each have simplified to realized work and pay. Human capital of\neach is remaining pay less the time discount. At the beginning of the last year, it is\nsomething less than one year’s pay. If pay measured work, return to each\n(work/human capital) would be something over 100% per year. It would rise to\n100% per day at the beginning of the last day, and 100% per second at the\nbeginning of the last second. At the end of the last second it reaches infinity. Yet the\nportfolio assets of each reveal their rates of time-preference (return) as only a few\npercentage points per year.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 10\nThis is enough to rule out the idea that pay recovers neither maintenance nor\ndepreciation. Does it say which is recovered? It does if we look at the cases of the\nboss and her secretary separately. Each earns the same pay throughout, and the\nboss earns ten times more. By the beginning of the last day, the human capital and\nwork of each is negligible. Pay is all depreciation recovery if I am right, or all\nmaintenance recovery if Quesnay was right, or maybe both. The boss’s pay, anyhow,\nremains ten times higher. Is that because her maintenance is ten time more, per\nQuesnay, or because her depreciation is?\nThe answer is easy. I concede that the higher-paid usually consume more. But not\nalways, and anyhow not in proportion and not because they have to. I learned in the\nquartermaster corps that the consumption needs of the general and the private are\nnot much different. The commanding officer, in the field, is expected to be the last to\neat, the last to sleep and the first up in the morning. Maintenance consumption, as\nopposed to the rest, is what we need to keep up strength and vitality and\nperformance. We can’t make do with less. More pay is more motive, but need not be\nspent on more consumption unless by choice.\nThe boss and her secretary are paid to apply skills. They are in trouble if the worth\nof those skills doesn’t cover their maintenance needs. But they will tap savings if it\ndoesn’t. Retirees need no money motive to consume. All they need is the means. The\nsource of skills applied is human capital. The application is gross realized work. The\ndifference between its human depreciation and realized work components matters\nbecause the maximand is net output (work) rather than gross. But it is not a\ndifference in kind. Skill applied is skill applied. Pay is all depreciation at the last\nsecond for the same reason as with the mortgage payment. There is no balance left\nto earn interest.\nThis argues strongly that human depreciation is recovered in literal pay and\ntransferred to work products. It also argues that maintenance is not. The problem is\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 11\nin the exact 10:1 proportion required throughout. Whatever was contributed to pay\nby maintenance recovery, on top of depreciation recovery, would have to hold the\nsame ratio in order for pay to cover both. Experience shows this as unlikely in any\ncase, let alone all cases. The boss and her secretary probably couldn’t hold\nmaintenance consumption to that ratio if they tried.\nAnother strong argument against the hypothesis of prior claims on pay is lack of a\nsource. The claimant would be whoever other than the worker had paid for the\nmaintenance consumption and needed to be made whole. Thus the employing firm\nwould hold a valid claim if it had provided the maintenance consumption in order to\nenable the work. That would put the firm in the position of a farmer who must feed\nthe livestock and must earn enough profit to recoup the cost. We went through this\nin the parable of Phil and Bill. But the employer firm does not advance the cost\nbecause it has no motive to do so. It knows that the worker will pay it anyhow if\nmeans allow. Where means don’t allow, as in retirement without adequate savings,\nthe worker looks to transfer payments from society generally rather than from the\nfirm alone.\nNow comes the evidence of age-wage profiles. This evidence is the substance behind\nthe parable of the boss and her secretary. The evidence is apt. Wage generally\nmeans hourly pay, while “earnings” means yearly pay. Wage-earnings profiles show\na rise with age, but peaking and reversing as workers reach their fifties or so. The\nreason is that they tend to work fewer hours. I consider pay per hour a better\nmeasure of human capital than pay per year. If someone is worth $30 per hour half\ntime, my impression is that she would be worth $30 per hour full time. If she prefers\nto stay home, her leisure must give her that much psychic pay instead. Psychic pay\ncuts just as much ice with me.\nMy boss and secretary were cases preferring to work full time. Age-wage profiles\nbear out the scenario I imagined for them. They illustrate the logical certainty that\nhuman depreciation is expected to be recovered in pay, and support the\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 12\nconvergence axioms leading from prediction to probable outcome. More than that,\ncontinuance of the 10:1 ratio through the last day tends to confirm that no\nmaintenance consumption is recovered alongside human depreciation. If it were,\nage-wage profiles show that it would have to hold the same 10:1 ratio throughout.\nExhaust Pay\nThe present value and maximand truisms affirm that all including human\ndepreciation is expected to be recovered in positive cash flow. Positive cash flow is\ntransfer out plus exhaust. In human capital it is pay less plowback. Might some\nhuman depreciation be realized in exhaust? I thought all was when I also thought\nmaintenance consumption was recovered in pay and work products. The boss and\nsecretary parable turned my thinking around on that. But it doesn’t follow that none\nis.\nSome pretty clearly is. I argued that even suicide expresses the maximand rule.\nDeliberate self-maiming exists and expresses it again. Just as Citizen Kane destroyed\nhis showcases because the fit was on him, some destroy their bodies. So long as the\ndestruction is intended and compos mentis, it counts as economic behavior.\nAre there sunnier examples? What about voluntary unpaid vacations and voluntary\nretirements? What if the boss and her secretary enter convents in mid-career?\nThese choices surrender human capital on the face of things because they surrender\nliteral future pay. But the psychic pay of leisure makes up for it. Otherwise we would\nhave stayed on the job track.\nThen some human depreciation is exhaust. Call the psychic pay for it “exhaust pay”.\nIt seems mercifully small in the big picture. I tend to neglect it in modeling for that\nreason, just as with invested consumption after full-time job entry. But I claimed\nlogical certitude as to expected recovery of human depreciation in pay. I’d better not\nleave loopholes. There are none. Some of the pay is psychic, and some of the tastes\nsatisfied are not pretty.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 13\nTweaking the Axioms\nMy last argument reasoned from experience that we need no money motive to\nconsume, and that pay tends to cover our maintenance needs. But that wasn’t\nstrictly in the axioms. I assumed a mortal and reproducing population strategizing\nfor means to satisfy tastes, and more generally aims. I didn’t say out loud that the\npopulation in fact survives. Now I do. Let’s specify that the population has motive\nand means for lineage survival, whether in a group selection or kin selection sense.\nThe means can be specified as skill sets, as an adult norm, sufficient to earn\nmaintenance consumption needs for themselves and invested consumption needs\nfor their young together. As to motive, I will specify at last that maintenance\nconsumption is exhausted in satisfying our taste for survival. I already as much as\nassumed this in arguing that we need no money motive to consume.\nThis assumption of motive and means amounts to the biological imperative. It is\nhardly new to economics. It is the essence of Petty’s overlapping generations model\nof 1662 in A Treatise of Taxes. It is the essence of the equilibrium wage theory of\nSmith in 1776 and Ricardo 1817, where pay converges to the level holding the work\nforce intact. It is the essence of Malthus’ population principle of 1798 and 1801,\nchosen by Senior as his first axiom in his Outline of 1836. It is the essence of the\nproductive consumption theory developed from Malthus through Mill in 1848.\nIt lapsed from attention with the marginalist revolution beginning with Jevons and\nMenger in 1871, ironically the year of publication of Darwin’s The Descent of Man,\nbecause the marginalists treated explanations of tastes as irrelevant. I happen to be\na huge fan of the marginalists. But they’ve made their point. The microeconomics\nthey founded is a rich and mature science. It needs no assumptions as to what\nexplains our tastes. But macro is not doing so well. I believe that it must start over,\nand that a grasp of motives helps.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 14\nQuesnay’s Idea\nWhat Quesnay wrote, in his entry for “man” in Diderot’s Encyclopedia of 1750, was\n“Those who make manufactured commodities do not produce wealth…they\nspend their receipts in order to obtain their subsistence. Thus they consume\nas much as they produce…and no surplus of wealth results from it.”\nQuesnay, like Petty a century before, came to economics from medicine. He was\npersonal physician to Madame de Pompadour, and then to the royal family. His\nargument was that value is added in agriculture alone, not in manufactures. His\nconclusion that only landowners can afford to pay taxes did not enchant the landed\naristocracy of Versailles.\nMill’s Essays 1 includes\n“as much as is necessary to keep the productive worker in perfect health and\nfitness for his employment, may be said to be consumed productivity. To this\nshould be added what he expends in rearing children to the age at which they\nbecome capable of productive industry.”\nMill’s Principles of 1848, which I quoted earlier, said the same:\n“What they consume in keeping up their health, strength and capacities of\nwork, or in rearing the productive laborers to succeed them, is productive\nconsumption.”\nSraffa’s parallel idea is expressed in his 1960 paper Production of Commodities by\nMeans of Commodities.\nMy impression is that Quesnay’s “surplus of wealth” means value added, and that he\nthought maintenance consumption should be deducted from revenue in finding it.\nMill can’t have meant what I think Quesnay did, in view of Mill’s evident belief that\noutput is investment plus consumption. Rather, when I like Quesnay argued that\n1 Essays on Some Unsettled Questions of Political Economy (1844).\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 15\nmaintenance is recovered in pay work products, I thought Mill and Sraffa might have\nreasoned partway there.\nMy belief then that human depreciation is exhausted is satisfying tastes seemed\ndefensible then. I argued, sensibly to a point, that getting older meant surviving. I\nsuppose I might still argue the same but for the parable of the boss and her\nsecretary.\nAnother Look at Depreciation Theory\nMy pay rules, illustrated in the parable of the boss and her secretary, depends on my\nidea that depreciation and amortization are the same. Capital means present value\nof a typically finite series of forseen cash flows. As each year passes, present value of\nthe most distant and most discounted one is lost. Depreciation/amortization is that\nloss. It begins at a maximum, and rises steadily as the end point nears.\nI faulted national accounts for projecting an opposite trajectory from evidence of\nactual sales. I suggested a second look at likely circumstances and motivations.\nDepreciable assets are mostly structures and equipment. They tend to have been\ndesigned and modified for original users. Original users typically expect to own and\noperate them to the end. Then what is the likely driver of exceptions? Are secondary\ntrades of plant and equipment likelier to be driven by pressure to buy or pressure to\nsell?\nHuman capital, anyhow, is exempt from both pressures. We’re struck with what we\nhave. We can invest more, as a homeowner might add a pool room, but we cannot\nsell. The years roll by, and present value of the most distant one’s pay is lost.\nConsider what happens when the expected end point changes. Say that the boss and\nher secretary, at the beginning of what was to be the last day, are both persuaded to\nre-up for another five years at the same pay. Human capital of each jumps from a\nlittle less than one day’s pay to present value of five years’ pay. But human\ndepreciation of each is sharply reduced! At the beginning of what seemed the last\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 16\nday, it was substantially to be the whole of pay. Now it becomes present value of a\nday’s pay five years off.\nAnother Look at Risk Theory\nI made the point that the boss and her secretary reveal their time preferences in the\nsecurity portfolios they assemble, and discount their pay at the same rate of return\nto reveal their human capital. Is that too simple? Does it overlook risk, or other\nfactors?\nI argued that human capital is the risker and higher-return factor because its\nexceptional versatility makes it as risky as we like, and because it is owned\ndisproportionately by the risk-tolerant young. Does that make the bosses’ or\nsecretary’s human capital riskier and higher in return than her portfolio assets? It\ndoes not. She molds all capital to her single risk-preference level at her current age.\nThis is not to claim that age is the only determinant. Gender seems to count too, with\nmales usually more risk-tolerant. Bob Trivers tells us why. And there is a wealth\neffect. We tend to tolerate more risk when wealth gives us more cushion against\nsetbacks. But each of us, in present circumstances, has just so much tolerance.\nTastes are properties of owners, not of assets. We assemble and modify assets of\nboth factors to suit them. Human capital is not inherently riskier. It is riskier at the\ncollective scale only because it is owned disproportionately by the risk-prone young.\nEach cohort, from youngest to oldest, molds it to suit that cohort’s characteristic risk\nprofile. The boss and her secretary each molds all her assets of both factors to her\nsingle risk tolerance at the time.\nTweaking the Life Cycle Model\nI consider Ben-Porath’s life cycle model of 1967 the most important paper in 20 th\ncentury economics. I agree with all of it more or less. Now it needs clarification and\ncompletion.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 17\nAll studies of human capital, as far as I know, effectively treat human depreciation as\ndeadweight loss. Ben-Porath’s model seems no exception. How does he model pay?\nHe multiplies human capital by a productivity factor, and then again by the fraction\nmarketed for pay rather than self-invested. That gives what I call realized work. Pay,\nif I am right, measures gross realized work. That is the main amendment I would\npropose for his model.\nBen-Porath’s first three equations summarize what I call the growth truism (6.14).\nIn my terms, not his, he models\nhuman growth = invested consumption + self-invested work\n– human depreciation.\nHe means positive self-invested work in the form of learning. Meanwhile the\ninalienability of human capital leaves its depreciation as its only avenue of\ndecapitalization. Invested consumption corresponds to gross transfer in as meant in\nthe growth truism (6.14c) while self-invested work is the same as proprietary\noutput. Then (6.4c) applied to human capital could show as\nconfirming (5.2) and (5.3a).\nhuman growth = invested consumption + positive self-invested work\n– human depreciation,\n= invested consumption + self-invested work\n– recovered human depreciation,\nLogic also seems to agree with Ben-Porath’s interpretation that self- invested work\ncontinues late into careers, and that it must stop when time for recovery runs out.\nBut I would specify that invested consumption stops, for modeling purposes, at fulltime\njob entry or a little later to allow for initial job training.\nThis needn’t follow from my adjusted axioms. It’s just an impression from what I see.\nI don’t agree with Schultz that outlays on medicine or worker relocation are\ninvestment. I see them as maintenance consumption preserving skills, not\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 18\ninvestment building skills. I don’t see much avenue for investment in adult human\ncapital except through textbooks and tuition. Some happens. I went back to school at\nthe Conservatory myself, and I buy lots of textbooks. But I just don’t see enough of it\naround me. Models must simplify. Mine would end invested consumption at\nindependence more or less.\nI would also model adult self-invested work as subliminal and costless job\nexperience. I don’t see it as taking a second away from work for pay. This again is\nmeant to describe the usual rule only. Ben-Porath’s model, I think, allows an\nimpression that workers can choose between earning and learning by allocation of\ntime. The quotes from Schultz in Chapter 5 described that as common. I just don’t\nsee much of it happening. Rather we tend to work fewer hours at the end of careers,\nnot the beginning or middle when time for recovery of self-invested work remains.\nI said that Ben-Porath’s equations imply\npay = realized work.\nI would substitute the pay rule\npay = gross realized work\n= realized work + human depreciation\n= work – self-invested work + human depreciation, (6.17)\nas a norm or expectation. It isn’t a guaranteed outcome because deadweight loss\nhappens to human capital too. We may be hit by a bus, or lose our jobs in a slump, or\nbe sent to prison or drafted into the army. The pay rule means that recovery is\nforeseen. If (6.17) were stated in terms of outcomes, “recovered” would have to be\ninserted before “human depreciation”.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 19\nI believe that the case for this rule is very strong. The deadweight loss rule and the\nargument from the maximand rule give logical certitude that human depreciation is\nexpected to be recovered in pay. The convergence axioms would then give actual\nrecovery as a norm. The rule disallows the prior claims hypothesis, or possibility\nthat maintenance is recovered too, from an accumulation of implausibilities that led\nme finally to rule them out by adjusting the axioms.\nThe life cycle model should also specify that human capital continues after\nretirement. I admit that this rules out the simplicities assumed in the boss/secretary\nparable. It continues because we earn imputed pay until the end, and human capital\nremains as its present value.\nI would also model in my depreciation theory. Pay, like the mortgage payments, is\nall realized work (interest) at the start and all human depreciation (amortization) at\nthe end. No other explanation of age-wage profiles will hold water.\nA New Approach to the Pay Rule\nI reasoned to the pay rule from the maximand and deadweight loss rules. Another\napproach can reach the same conclusion.\nThe total return truism finds\noutput = capital growth + cash flow.\n(6.16) expressed Ben-Porath’s equation as\nhuman growth = invested consumption + self-invested work\n–recovered human depreciation.\nCash flow is the flow discounted to present value. Tradition, since Farr in the midnineteenth\ncentury, has seen human capital as present value of future pay less what\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 20\nI call invested consumption. I argued in Chapter 3 that this tradition is sound,\nalthough not logical certitude. I put it as\nhuman cash flow = pay – invested consumption. (6.18)\nWork is defined as the output of human capital. Summing (6.16) and (6.17) now\nshows the pay rule\nwork = pay + self-invested work – recovered human depreciation,\nafter cancellation of invested consumption.\nThis says that the pay rule is not so exotic after all. It has been staring us in the face\nsince the Schultz-led consensus, with Ben-Porath, figured out the human growth\nequation a half a century ago. We had effectively recognized human cash flow as\npay less invested consumption since Farr a century before, without putting it in\nthose words. The total return truism does the rest.\nA New Approach to the Y Rule\nThe marginalist tradition, which has dominated economic thought since its\nintroduction by Jevons and Menger in 1871, has treated all consumption as the end\npoint exhausting capital in satisfying tastes. It doesn’t follow that marginalists were\nunaware that some is invested in human capital. At least three of the leading ones\nunderstood human capital well. That includes Leon Walras, a third co-founder of the\nmarginalist revolution in 1874. I also mentioned Marshall, who agreed with Farr in\ndisputing Petty, and Irving Fisher. But all three, and marginalsts in general,\npreferred to locate human capital outside the economy proper. Whether they spoke\nof labor measured in dollars per unit time, or human capital meansured in dollars\nalone, the larger factor was taken to arrive exogenously. It provided its services\nfrom outside and was paid their market value in return, as if on the books of a firm.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 21\nMarshall’s pupil Keynes was thoroughly a marginalist, as are economists in general\ntoday and as am I. One of the features of his General Theory of 1936 was a kind of\ndouble-entry accounting for national product. Product was output and equivalently\nincome. Output meant the sum of prices of final products produced within the year,\nwhile income meant the shares of that sum paid to the workers and investors\nproducing it. His double-entry idea can be put as\noutput = investment + consumption = income = pay + profit. (6.19)\nI showed why I disagree. But let us see how the total return truism might seem to\nhave led to that inference if we leave workers or human capital outside the economy.\nTo treat them as arriving exogenously from outside is essentially to treat the\nnational economy as if it were a single firm. Output inside is simply profit. Output\noutside is work, meaning creation of value by the workers. This gives the truism\noutput = work + profit,\nconfirming that total output is the sum of factor outputs.\nSo far, so good. But now Mill and Keynes and most tradition slip by arguing that pay\nequals and compensates all of work and nothing else. That’s why (6.18) equates\noutput to pay plus profit. Schultz and Ben-Porath and other students of human\ncapital correct this in part by recognizing some work as self-invested rather than\nmarketed for pay. My pay rule adds that pay recovers human depreciation as well as\nrealized work. (6.19) should have reasoned\noutput = income = work + profit\n= pay + self-invested work – human depreciation + profit. (6.20)\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 22\nWhere Keynes and Kuznets and macroeconomic tradition have been right is in\nreasoning that pay and gross profit, meaning gross of depreciation, sum to the\n“expenditure” spent on consumption and gross investment. This fact of arithmetic is\nthe logic behind Say’s law: pay plus profit are always enough to buy what is\nproduced. We saw that this truism gives cold comfort when calamity or\nmisjudgment make profit negative, as with the subprime houses of 2008. What it\ncertifies, anyhow, is\nexpenditure = pay + gross profit = consumption + gross investment. (6.21)\nWe can subtract depreciation to reach\npay + profit = consumption + investment. (6.22)\nNow (6.19) can be corrected as a whole to show\nincome = pay + profit + self-invested work – human depreciation\n= output\n= consumption – investment + self-invested work\n– human depreciation. (6.23)\nMy main goal in this book has been to further the work of Solow in exogenizing\ngrowth, and also the work of Ben-Porath in endogenizing human capital as\nsomething produced within the economy. It was in that spirit that I derived the Y\nrule in Chapters 2 and 5 by putting human capital inside. I reached\noutput = investment + human capital growth + cash flow.\nHere “ex post net” is understood before output and investment, so that investment\nmeans physical capital growth. (6.16) applies the growth truism to human capital.\nThe cash flow truism shows that cash flow is net transfer plus exhaust realized in\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 23\ntaste satisfaction. These are all ex post descriptions of realized outcomes rather than\nintentions. Together they give\noutput = investment + invested consumption + positive self-invested work\n− human depreciation + net transfer + exhaust\n= investment + invested consumption + self-invested work\n− recovered human depreciation + net transfer + exhaust. (6.24)\nThis much is certitude. I now apply (5.9), which includes\nconsumption = invested consumption + pure consumption,\nto reach the Y rule in its general form:\noutput = investment + consumption + self-invested work\n− human depreciation + net transfer. (6.25)\nThe net transfer term disappears at the collective scale.\nAlthough (6.24) is logical certitude infered from definitions, (5.9) and consequently\n(6.25) are not. I cannot rule out the possibility of a third kind of consumption\nrecovered in work products as per Quesnay. I hope that my interpretation of agewage\nprofiles in the light of the boss-secretary parable has revealed that as\nimprobable. The same holds for my derivation of the pay rule through Ben-Porath’s\nequation and (6.18). (6.18), my inference that human cash flow equals less invested\nconsumption, also trusts that all maintenance consumption is exhausted in\nsatisfying tastes.\nSummary\nAccounting for human capital is much like accounting in a firm. Expected recovery of\nhuman depreciation in pay is logical certitude illustrated in age-wage profiles and in\nthe boss-secretary parable. The pay rule is not entirely logical certitude, however, as\nit also asserts that maintenance consumption is not recovered. Age-wage profiles\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 24\nsupport this hypothesis too, as the constancy of pay differences to the end would\notherwise be improbable. I made it the Darwinian axiom: maintenance is exhausted\nin satisfying our taste for survival.\nBen-Porath’s life cycle was adjusted to express these features. Factor risk theory\nargued that human capital is the riskier and higher-return factor because capital of\nany kind takes on the risk characteristics of its owners and human capital is owned\ndisproportionately by the risk-tolerant young.\nThe Y rule contradicts the Y = I + C equation, while the pay rule contradicts the\ndogma that output equals pay plus work. National accounts are founded on both.\nThat means I can expect tough resistance. I have tried to prepare for it by adding a\nlittle more to each argument with each chapter.\nThroughout this chapter, and throughout this book, I have bent over backwards to\ndistinguish logical certitudes from falsifiable hypothesis. Economics needs both. But\nit needs to know which is which. The pay and Y rules, for example, are each\ncertitude in part. The certain part is the heretical one. The present value and\nmaximand rules follow from definitions, and compel expected recovery of human\ndepreciation in pay. I then relied on the convergence axioms to infer actual recovery\nas a norm, not a invariable outcome, and on the new axiom of the biological\nimperative, as well as evidence from age-wage profiles, to infer that maintenance\nconsumption is exhausted rather than recovered in pay as well.\nChapter 6: Parallels with the Firm 2/4/16 25\nCHAPTER 7: PETTY’S IDEA\nHow We Got to this Point\nI said that if I had any sense, I would have left the worms in the can by pretending to\nbelieve (4.1) as Mill did and as the rest of the world seems to do. Charts and tables\nconfirm his prediction in his and their terms as well as mine. But Piketty’s argument\nwas rightly criticized for leaving human capital out. Someone might or might not\nhave faulted mine on the same ground if I had stopped at the end of Chapter 4.\nWhether they would have or not, every composer knows that the critic to hear is the\none inside. What that critic told me was to gamble a case already won, open the can,\nand follow the argument and worms wherever they lead. That’s why my title\npromised other surprises.\nI risked following it past clarification into digression when I argued the pay rule. I\nsince tried to justify the digression, if there was some, by showing how that rule\ncould explain Piketty’s data for pay/net profit ratios in the twentieth century. And I\ntried to show how the pay rule and depreciation theory combined, making pay all\nhuman depreciation and no realized work at the end, gives the only convincing\nexplanation of age-wage profiles showing rising or steady pay as human capital\ngrades smoothly to zero. Risk theory reinforced this argument by revealing time\ndiscount rates for human capital as those made plain for physical capital owned by\nthe same ageing cohorts. Every step was an adventure, and every step led to the\nnext one. But I opened other questions and cans along the way, and the same critic\ntells me to follow the worms a little farther.\nI said that the cost of survival is adult consumption for the sake of investment in the\nnext generation, that pure consumption is more or less the same, and that we will\nunderstand the maximand when we understand pure consumption. These threads\nlead into evolutionary biology, which reasons how traits are selected for lineage\nsurvival. The faithful need not take alarm. Although I mean natural selection, divine\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 1\nselection should probably do as well. We are all at peace with the fact that people\nand other creatures care for their young.\nEconomics and evolutionary biology are much the same. Helen Keller, born blind\nand deaf, might still have reasoned her way through much of both. Hamlet would\nhave loved them. I love them most when they test the limits of logic, and consult the\ndata only at the end. The theme from which both reason, as Herbert Spencer taught\nin the nineteenth century, is what he called “survival of the fittest.” Another\nphilosopher, Karl Popper, found fault with this idea a century later. Popper was one\nof those I mentioned who disapprove of truisms. I haven’t read Popper, but gather\nthat he thought it improper to define fitness as potential survival, and then measure\nit as survival. That objection is close to being understandable from an anti-truism\nviewpoint. But the reason why it is not quite a truism is instructive. Measurement\nimplies an “empirical” world of data in external and observable reality. Spencer’s\ninsight, really his paraphrase and generalization of Darwin’s, is not quite a truism\nbecause it carries the hypothesis that “potential” has an empirical meaning.\nAristotle’s idea that potency precedes and explains act is called causality. Adam\nSmith’s friend and fellow Scotsman David Hume scarcely doubted causality, but\nargued correctly (I think) that it cannot be proved either by logic or by experiment.\nThe fittest prove themselves such by surviving if and only if Aristotle was right.\nNatural selection simply means the untestable but little-doubted theory of causality.\nSpencer or Darwin or Gertrude Stein might be faulted for insulting our intelligence\nby stating the obvious. That shoe would fit Gertrude Stein. But Spencer and Darwin,\nlike the little boy in Hans Christian Andersen’s The Emperor’s New Clothes, were\nstating the obvious unseen. Andersen’s point was that intelligence was not the thing\nlacking or what the little boy supplied. It was about how tradition and mind-sets and\nin-groups might sometimes need a look from outside. Peer review is not enough.\nSometimes it perpetuates nonsense. The little boy was not a peer, but he could tell\nclothes when he saw them. (“Peer”, as any theorist knows, means someone who\npees on your theory.)\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 2\nI confess that this book casts me as that little boy crashing the economic party, and\nmaybe the evolutionary biology one too, in trust that outsiders might have better\nchances to spot the obvious unseen. What else was the pay rule? I derived it easily\nfrom doctrines already accepted, I think, and anyhow hard to refute. Those were the\ntotal return turism and Ben-Porath’s equation for human growth. The maximand\nrule or deadweight loss rule would prove it as well. How could Becker have missed\nthat what holds for investment in job training by employers holds for any\ninvestment by anyone in anything? How could students of the age-wage problem\nhave missed the obvious solution? Investment implies expected recovery with\ninterest, by the investor or a chosen donee, and recovery means recovery of\ndepreciation. I belabor this point because tradition dies hard, and naturally tends to\ncircle wagons under attack. I doubt that my surprise attack will meet the resistance\nDarwin’s found. Darwin’s met resistance founded on faith. I took pains to show that\nmy version requires only selection for lineage survival, and that a benign Artificer\nmight ordain the same.\nEvolutionary Biology and Hamilton’s Rule\nEconomics, meaning any quantitative rationale of choice, normally describes\nhumans and human choice. That goes for this book too. But some treatments of\neconomics including this one are meant to fit other creatures as well. My axioms\nhave kept that in mind. The mortal and reproducing population need not be human.\nMuch of the animal kingdom, I think, shows convergent tastes and predictions or\nacts as if it did. The biological imperative is meant to apply to all. All, as I see it, own\ncapital of both factors. Even protozoans own (“monopolize”) the nutrients they\nassimilate and the space they occupy. Humans are exceptional in their cultural\naccumulations of learning and technology shown in our secular (lasting) growth.\nBut I did not make those features axioms.\nI argued that economics tended to reason explicitly or implicitly from the biological\nimperative, meaning what I call “ends” in lineage survival, from Petty through Smith\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 3\nand Ricardo and Malthus and Mill, until the marginalist revolution shifted focus\nfrom objectives to the mechanics in supply, demand and price. Bioeconomics awoke\na century later, largely it seems in response to the challenge of Hamilton’s rule. Now\nI will look at it too.\nMy term “lineage survival” is unusual. It is meant not to take sides between “kin\nselection” and “group selection.” The kin selection idea was another word for\nHamilton’s rule from his doctorial thesis in 1964. It said that genes encoding\ninvestment in close kin encode investment in likeliest sharers of those genes, and\nshould tend to entrench and perpetuate themselves. His condition for investment\nwas r 〉 bc . r here meant relatedness: ½ for offspring or siblings, ¼ for nephews or\nnieces or grandoffspring, and so forth. b meant benefit to the donee, and c meant\ncost to the investor. The sign > means “greater than”. The cost and benefit were\nmeasured in fitness itself, meaning chances to survive and breed. But that too meant\n“inclusive fitness” where investing in kin counted as breeding when adjusted for\nrelatedness. The idea was that I give up some of my chances if I can increase yours\nto my net genic advantage in the long run. Hamilton allowed for exceptions\nincluding meiotic drive, which sometimes forecloses gene competition. His rule\nprevailed because it made mostly good predictions. Humans and creatures in\ngeneral usually care for their own young first, if they have any, and for closely\nrelated young if not.\nHamilton made it clear that cost c and benefit b in his hurdle rb > c respectively\nmeant fitness given up by the investor and fitness grained by the investee. He\nfurther made it clear that fitness could be measured as R. A. Fisher’s “reproductive\nvalue” V(x) published in 1930 and 1957. V(x) meant likelihood at age x of\nreaching each successive age times expected offspring at that age. V(x), or Bob\nTrivers’ “reproductive success” RS, which simplifies V(x) to expected remaining\noffspring, is implicitly constant at the population scale unless there is population\ngrowth (Fisher’s “Malthusian parameter”). For creatures other than us, the\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 4\nparameter typically fluctuates around zero and group fitness holds about where it\nstarted.\nHamilton’s rule, applied to diploids like us where closest relatedness r absent\ninbreeding is ½, forbids investment where fitness gained (benefit) is less than twice\nfitness given up (cost). I see no escape from the inference that fitness would double\nwith each generation, or more to account for cases where relatedness fell below ½. I\nsee no relief in an interpretation, say, that each successive generation cures this\nimbalance by investing only half or less of its fitness and letting the rest lapse.\nFitness is likelihood of leaving descendants of equal fitness. It is not strictly\nconserved, because likelihood is generally not identical to outcome. There is ex ante\nand ex post fitness. But the ex ante kind is meaningless unless potency, in Aristotle’s\nterms, is expected to converge to act. Hamilton’s rule should not have escaped this\ncritique for half a century. It clearly has merit, but needs some different expression.\nSuch a reformulation might treat rb/c as a maximand within practical constraints.\nWe can see how it might be by looking at the context. Darwin’s idea is a competition\nfor breeding success. This biological imperative is a powerful predictor in nature. It\npredicts that traits are selected for successful reproduction to the exclusion of all\nelse. Evidence is impressive. “Semelparous” creatures who breed only once and do\nnot invest postpartum care, like salmon and soybeans, die within hours. An octopus\nmother breeds only once, cares for her young a few weeks, and dies as they disperse.\nNature is on a tight budget. Resources wasted soon become resources lost to\nthriftier lineages.\nHamilton saw this. He was right in stressing the role of competition among\nindividuals and individual heritable traits. Darwin did the same. One thing\nHamilton’s rule leaves out, which is not to claim that he overlooked it, is that traits\nand their genes best at prioritizing self-replication might for that reason hurt\nchances of achieving it. We know this happens. Human tradition everywhere resists\nand punishes nepotism when it crosses a line. Jane Goodall reported the same for\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 5\nher chimps at Gombe. I think I have seen it among the pack of dogs, led by my\nfather’s favorite “Sean”, at Sutton Place. That would count as one of the practical\nconstraints. Too little support for family over equally deserving others is seen as a\nfault, and too much as another.\nThe reason is obvious. Jack’s ambitions for kin will eventually conflict with Zack’s,\njust as with ambitions for food and nest sites and mating opportunities. Not\neveryone’s firstborn can be king of the hill. Social creatures evolve agonistic rules to\nsettle such conflicts peacefully. Losers in mating tournaments, or in contests where\nmales display and females choose, usually survive to compete again next year. The\ncontest is in the group interest because the traits of strength and skill proved in the\nwinner will be those passed on. Our genes tell us to compete as best we can for the\nsake of a fair test, and to stop when the verdict seems clear. And soon enough it does.\nThe quarterback tries his best for three downs to move the yardsticks, but trots to\nthe sidelines on fourth down for the sake of another chance later. If genes can\nencode this farsighted strategy for those other kinds of competition, why not for\nnepotistic competition too?\nFor decades, biologists wondered why genes need so much selecting in species long\nestablished. Shouldn’t earlier contests have selected the fittest genes once and for all,\nwith no need for further ones but to screen out recent and harmful mutations?\nShouldn’t the best traits have become clear millennia ago? Why need males contest\nin tournaments or beauty contests every breeding season, with mostly the same\ncontestants, when best genes ought to have proved themselves soon after the\nspecies began? Then there would be no genetic diversity except for recent\nmutations not yet screened out. Population genetists such as Fisher, J. B. S. Haldane\nand Sewall Wright had written mathematical models showing that even the slightest\nselection pressures should drive a gene to fixity, and its rivals to extinction, within a\nfew generations if selection favored it consistently. Their argument was Malthus’\ninsight: breeding success is geometric. Yet there is rich allelic diversity wherever we\nlook. There are some gene sites in some species where the most common allele\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 6\nholds frequencies under ten percent, and those frequencies are constantly shifting.\nThe flux proves that losers are allowed mating opportunities too, though not as\nmuch, and leave young to compete in the next generation.\nHamilton explained why that could make sense in a paper published with Marlene\nZuk in 1982. George Williams in 1976 and John Tooby in 1980 had argued that\nfittest genes in one generation might not be fittest in the next if niche pressures\nvaried to counter current gene choices. Tooby had pointed to parasites and\npathogens, particularly single-cell ones whose life cycle runs less than an hour. They\ncould evolve new strains to outflank our old defenses and call for new ones.\nHamilton and Zuk continued this theme. They suggested that genes might have long\nmemories, put in human terms, and might have seen the same parasites and\npathogens pull such tricks before. If some individuals in the host population still\ncarried the antidote gene that worked the last time the same unexpected strain\narose, or something close enough to it, hosts collectively could weather the threat if\nthat antidote gene could be identified and spread fast enough. Then how? Hamilton\nand Zuk proposed that what winning males display in contests of singing or\ncroaking or agility or symmetry, or bright colors in the right places, was possession\nof the genes needed to counter the current strains of pathogens and parasites.\nLosers in the same contests carried genes that had proved best against strains of the\npast and might come back in the future. Nepotism practiced by winners would\nspeed up the spread of the current antidote. But losers carried genes that had\nworked against other strains that might recur. A way had to be found to keep all\nthose potential antidotes somewhere in the medicine cabinet. Current losers had to\nbe saved for later. Gene diversity was the key to group survival in the long run. The\nquarterback trots to the bench on fourth down because that is better for himself and\nthe team than being carried to the hospital. He realizes that other players are best\nfor punts or field goals or defense until he gets the ball again. Selection pressures do\nnot favor the same traits and genes every time.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 7\nHamilton’s Parasite Theory\nMy take on Hamilton’s 1982 paper, which I consider his masterpiece, is a blend of\nhis thoughts, Bob Trivers’ from a decade before, Richard Alexander’s, and maybe\nmine. Mine sees a population arranged in local “demes” which intrabreed in most\ncases for best adaptation to local pressures including pathogens and parasites. A\nlocal strain to which the local deme is adapted might spread to other demes which\nare not. Hosts in the invaded demes become sick. Female ones there intuit the\ndegraded conditions, breed less often, and breed mostly females (mothers can\nchoose) because males with their now ill-adapted anti-parasite (histocampatability)\ngenes will find few willing mates. This begins the part from Trivers. I’ll come to\nAlexander’s later.\nMothers in the source deme see an opposite picture. Conditions are not necessarily\nbetter than before, but they are better than in the invaded demes. They intuit this,\nbreed more often, and breed mostly males. The males migrate to those invaded\ndemes, carrying histocompatibility genes pre-adapted to the invaders, and find\nwilling mates there if they can show the signs. The idea that mothers choose to\nbreed mostly males in prosperous conditions is the other half of Trivers’ idea. The\nidea that the invading parasite and the males with antidote genes might tend to\noriginate from the same deme may be mine.\nThat presupposes that females can trust the signs. Nature makes sure they can. She\nprovides resistant males with hard-to-feign ones to prove it. This was one of\nHamilton’s key insights. His idea has been called the “truth in advertising” theory.\nSymmetrical antlers, deep croaks, accurate songs and bright colors where they\nshould be tell the females whose genes can be trusted. Parasites and pathogens\nwould fake them in afflicted host males if they could. It seems they can’t.\nHamilton, I believe, had solved three nagging puzzles at once. Why does nature\nwaste resources on beauty displays that seem at first glance to hinder fitness? A\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 8\npeacock’s tail feathers are an encumbrance in running from predators. And why give\nthe expensive displays mostly to males? Why do males exist at all in species where\nthey contribute genes but no care?\nWe just saw the answer to the first. Answers to the second two again build on an\ninsight of Trivers in 1973. Males produce cheap sperm carrying genes alone.\nFemales produce eggs packed with costly nutrients. A male can pass genes to many\ndescendants through many mates if they approve his signs. That speeds up the fight\nagainst parasites. Nature evolved males and their self-promoting signs and their\ncontests for fastest spread of antidote genes to catch up to shifts in parasite load.\nWhere Do Losers Go?\nA key point in the Hamilton-Zuk theory is that losers’ genes in the beauty contest are\ntypically not driven to extinction. They are driven to low frequencies until needed\nagain. Kin selection, up to a point, helps maintain genic diversity by preserving\ncurrent losers within the gene pool. Selection pressures punish and restrain kin\nselection when it conflicts with preservation of other genes whose time will come\nagain. I met Hamilton at a conference in Squaw Valley, where Bob Trivers had\nhelped us attract him, and told him this reason why I thought his 1982 paper helped\ncomplete and qualify his 1964 paper. He was the absent-minded professor to\nperfection. Moody, distracted, profound. He smiled, a rare thing for him, and said\n“It’s been a long search.”\nThis explains what I mean by lineage survival or fitness. Much of this book assumes\nits maximization even among modern humans, who create our own urban\nenvironments in place of the ancestral savanna for which we were adapted. And\nmuch of economic history, although written in cities by city-dwellers, appears to\nassume the same. Chapter 2 listed some examples. Let’s review them. There was\nPetty’s of 1662. The similar equilibrium wage theories of Smith and Ricardo\nexpected pay to converge to the level maintaining and replacing the work force,\nwhich is trusted to spend it on both. Malthus’ population principle in 1798 and 1801\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 9\nadded the mechanics. Nassau Senior made that principle his first axiom in his\nOutline of 1836. The biological imperative lapsed from attention when the first\ngeneration of marginalists, led by Jevons and Menger, with Walras soon to follow,\nthought it unscientific to explain or justify tastes. It reemerged a century later in\nbioeconomics, much of which looked for economic implications of Hamilton’s rule.\nWe will see how it might clarify pure consumption and the maximand.\nEnlightened Kin Selection\nHamilton’s rule needs completion because the quarterback and his genes have\nfigured out that the bench is better than the hospital. What really happens, I think, is\na long-range example of Bob Trivers’ “reciprocal altruism” of 1971 as generalized by\nRichard Alexander. Bob wrote that creatures might invest in non-kin if the\ninvestment were expected to be repaid with interest. Alexander added that the\nrepayment could be to the investor’s kin with equal genetic benefit if Hamilton’s\nhurdle rb > c were cleared from the investor’s perspective. The quarterback yields\nto special teams on fourth down, and they to the defense until possession changes\nagain, for the best interests of each and all in the long run. The interest they receive\nin turn for deferring to non-kin is the cost of maintaining themselves on the bench. It\ndoes not accrue and compound because it is paid out continuously. It is an insurance\ncost that each temporary winner dares not trim. Group selection is enlightened kin\nselection.\nThree or four decades ago, this much acknowledgement of group selection would\nhave met more resistance than I expect now. It shouldn’t have. Half the beauty of the\nHamilton-Zuc scenario is in explaining allelic diversity as a result of agonistic rather\nthan lethal competition. Zack and Jack and their genotypes are rivals now because\nthey are teammates in the big picture.\nKin selection is a help until it crosses the line and becomes a hindrance. Some\nmothers in the source deme will carry higher frequencies of the antidote gene than\nothers. They will tend to be healthier, and so able to invest more energy in more\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 10\nyoung. If all mothers invest preferentially in their own, or maximize Hamilton’s\nstandard rb > c , healthier mothers will produce more young with higher doses of\nthe antidote genes, while sicklier mothers will produce less with less. Here it is\nfemales who compete to prove the same better genes that males just proved in the\ntournaments or beauty contests.\nThe race against parasites speeds up again with Trivers’ fine insight about healthier\nmothers choosing to dial up the ratio of sons to daughters (“primary sex ratio”), and\nto expand the reproductive period at both ends with shorter birth spacing for more\nmale offspring still. (Some of this may be my idea rather than his.) Nature proves\nbest current genes twice. Fathers prove them by duking it out or strutting their stuff.\nMothers carrying the same best genes prove it by winning the breeding contest\nagainst other mothers after.\nThe ex ante/ ex post distinction counts as much in biology as in economics. Here it\naccelerates the selection process. Offspring carrying the antidote gene to meet\ncurrent parasites will generally not on that account cost more ex ante invested\nconsumption to raise. If they are males, who can turn that advantage into many\noffspring, the ex post value of that same investment can be far higher. The converse\nworks for offspring lacking the gene. Their mothers can make the best of it by\nproducing females who will find breeding opportunities anyhow with mates\ncarrying the gene, since she knows which they are and males always have cheap\nsperm to spare, and will so keep their own genes in the gene pool.\nParasites got the last laugh by killing Hamilton on research in Africa a few years\nafter I met him. I never knew well enough to call him Bill. Bob Trivers called him the\ndeepest thinker in the world. That couldn’t be wrong by much.\nParasites and Demes\nErnst Mayr, Bob Trivers’ doctoral advisor at Harvard, defined a deme as a race or\nsubpopulation that intrabreeds at least 95% of the time. I hypothesize that it does so,\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 11\nin some cases, to maximize frequency of a histocompatibility gene which is an\nantidote to the local strain of parasite or pathogen. This idea could complement the\nHamilton-Zuc parasite model nicely. It would give a safe home to which both gene\nand parasite could retreat until their times come again.\nPeriod of Production Theory\nBack to economics. Chapter 4 mentioned John Rae as a contributor to what later\ndeveloped into Mill’s free growth theory. Rae’s book, published in 1834, also begins\nwhat was called period of production theory. The idea was that production took\ntime, and that profit compensated the investor’s patience over the production\nperiod. Senior, who had sent Rae’s book to Mill, adopted this idea in his own betterknown\nOutline in 1836. Rae’s book itself found few readers, despite its warm\nendorsement by Mill in his own magnus opus of 1848. Jevons adopted the idea from\nSenior in 1871, and Boehm Bawerk from Senior and Jevons in his book of 1889.\nBoehm Bawerk soon learned of Rae’s work, and dedicated later editions to him.\nPeriod of production theory thrives today in the Austrian School, which had been\nfounded by Boehm Bawerk’s teacher Carl Menger in 1871. (Menger was the guy who\nsquabbled with Schmoller in Chapter 2.)\nIt has found little favor elsewhere. The period seemed impractical to define or\nmeasure, and so gave little predictive value. Joseph Schumpeter, a student of Boehm\nBawerk who disagreed with him on this point, argued in 1911 that the period of\nproduction is zero; capital is present continuously. Frank Knight, who had\nanticipated Schultz in realizing that some consumption is investment in human\ncapital, argued as Schumpeter had.\nBut the theory is true by definition. Any rate is the inverse or reciprocal of a period.\nThe inverse of 4% per year is 25 years. Return is the ratio of net output to capital\nproducing it, meaning the rate of production, and its reciprocal is the period of\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 12\nproduction. Where the critics were right was in finding a lack of clarity and\npredictive value in the theory. Where does it lead? Rabbits and redwoods have\ndifferent periods of production, at first glance, but should nonetheless agree in\nreturn if in risk. Jevons wrote that he meant production of the “wage fund” as a\nwhole, meaning the universe of consumer goods. But he pointed to wine and timber\nas examples to help pin down the period. Boehm Bawerk picked nine years for no\nreason I can see.\nAll went wrong by considering physical capital only. The factors blend into each\nother; physical becomes human capital through invested consumption, and\nconversely when human depreciation is recovered in products. The generation\nlength gives the replacement period for total capital if total capital is interpreted as\nfitness and if all fitness of each generation is passed to the next.\nJevons and Boehm Bawerk assumed growthlessness for simplicity, and would have\nrealized that they were modeling only the replacement component in net output.\nBoehm Bawerk’s contribution, anticipated by Petty, was his insight that time\npreference rate explains rate of return by pricing the capital denominator, and not\nthe reverse. This had not been clear in Rae or Senior or Jevons. I give all four high\nmarks for a near miss. But they could have come closer. Remember that Senior’s\nfirst axiom had been Malthus’ population principle. He and the others would also\nhave known of Petty’s human and total capital idea, which was occasionally revived\nand critiqued. They didn’t quite connect the dots.\nNext Generation Theory\nPetty wrote A Treatise of Taxes in 1662. The whole title continues to about as many\nwords, counting ampersands, as pages in the book or pamphlet. His son tells us that\nPetty dictated his books overnight to secretaries who slept by turns. It is easy to\nbelieve that Petty didn’t need much sleep. He was a go-getter who had sailed to\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 13\nIreland as chief medical officer to Cromwell’s ironsides, stayed on to survey the Irish\nland with which Cromwell would pay his troops, and then got Parliament’s approval\nto invest in that high-risk land to make a fortune. It is rare for a man of practical gifts\nto be a deep thinker too. Petty, like my father, was both. His Verbum Sapienti of 1664\nwas first to apply the ancient capitalization formula to both factors, meaning\nworkers as well as tradeable things, and so originated the concept of human capital\nas present value. He applied this insight there and his Political Arithmetick in 1676,\nand again in The Total Wealth of England in 1683, to measure the total wealth of\nEngland including human capital. That makes him the father of national accounts.\nBut his greatest achievements, I think came in A Treatise of Taxes.\nChapter 4, paragraph 9 of that book begins with\n19. Having found the Rent or value of the usus fructus per annum, the\nquestion is, how many years purchase (as we usually say) is the Fee simple\nnaturally worth? If we say an infinite number, then an Acre of Land would be\nequal in value to a thousand Acres of the same Land; which is absurd, an\ninfinity of unites being equal to an infinity of thousands.\nPetty clearly recognizes that time preference, meaning our taste for impatience,\nexplains productivity, or ratio of output to capital, rather than the other way around.\nThis powerful and counterintuitive insight is usually credited to Boehm Bawerk in\n1889, who showed that it is true for man-made things as well as land. The utility or\nusus fructus being a given, we bid less for the land or other capital producing it if we\nare less patient, and more if more. Bidding less for this denominator of rate of return\nbids that rate itself up if the numerator is a given, and conversely. That’s why riskier\nassets offer higher return. Petty’s reductio ad absurdam of a hypothesis of infinite\npatience is obvious in hindsight, but may not have been written down before. Petty\ncontinues:\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 14\nWherefore we must pitch upon some limited number, and that I apprehend\nto be the number of years, which I conceive one man of fifty years old,\nanother of twenty eight, and another of seven years old, all being alive\ntogether may be thought to live; that is to say, of a Grandfather, Father and\nChilde; few men having reason to take care of more remote Posterity: for if a\nman be a great Grandfather, he himself is so much nearer his end, so as there\nare but three in a continual line of descent usually coexisting together; and as\nsome are Grandfathers at forty years, yet as many are not till above sixty, and\nsic de eteteris.\n20. Wherefore I pitch the number of years purchase, that any Land is\nnaturally worth, to be the ordinary extent of three such person their lives.\nNow in England we esteem three lives equal to one and twenty years, and\nconsequently the value of Land, to be about the same number of years\npurchase. Possibly if they thought themselves mistaken. . . .(as the observer\non the Bills of Mortality thinks they are. . .)\n21. . . . But in other Countreys Lands are worth nearer thirty years purchase,\nby reason of the better titles, more people, and perhaps truer opinion of the\nvalue and duration of three lives.\n23. One the other hand, Lands are worth fewer years purchase (as in\nIreland) . . . by reason of the frequent rebellions. . .”\nThe “other Countreys” could include France and especially Holland, then models of\nprosperity. Petty had made his fortune in Irish mortgages, and knew the years\npurchase there.\nBut the argument is a puzzle. There is a focus on longevity and mortality, as if the\ngenerations are providing for old age. But Petty’s overlapping generations model\ncannot be much like Paul Samuelson’s of three centuries later, where a generation of\nproductives leaves a nest egg for retirement. Samuelson’s productives are\nreplenished exogenously, with children left to the imagination. Why would Petty\nhave mentioned their ages? And retirement at age 50, as a norm, would have made\nno sense to Petty or his readers. The grandfather will stay in harness.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 15\nThe one and twenty years could mean remaining life expectancy at age 50. But Petty\ncould easily have spelled that out, or the implied 71 year terminus. He does spell out\nthe ages of the three generations. Their average difference in age rounds to 21\nyears.\nPetty’s readers, like Smith’s and Ricardo’s after, would have taken it for granted that\neach generation provides for the next. “Few men having reason to take care of more\nremote posterity” would have registered in the context of that provision. “Posterity”\nusually meant and means descendants.\nHis description, like mine, is incomplete. He may mean that life expectancy is also a\nfactor in calculating the years purchase. If so, he apparently leaves that thought to\nbe followed up later. There is also room to argue that the grandfather looks two\ngenerations ahead, so that the years purchase becomes 42 years. But that would\ngive the usus fructus at 2.3%. All the rates Petty reports elsewhere in the tract are\nmuch higher. One generation length is what he seems to apply. My reading is that\nthe grandfather provides for the grandson by passing all to the son.\nPetty’s overlapping generation insight has been one of his least noticed, just as with\nMill’s on output growth preceding and explaining capital growth. I first read of\nPetty’s idea in a collection of Lionel Robbins’ lectures at London School of\nEconomics delivered in 1979-1980, but published in 2000. I learned from these\nlectures that Gustav Cassel had published the same idea in his The Nature and\nNecessity of Interest in 1903. I hunted that down. Robbins misremembered in telling\nhis students that Cassel had arrived at the idea independently. In fact Cassel and\nRobbins both quote the same excerpts from A Treatise of Taxes that I just did. Cassel\ninferred that interest rates cannot stably be less than 2% per year.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 16\nI arrived at the same idea independently, anyhow, and published it in Social Science\nInformation in 1989. To date it is my only publication in a refereed journal, and\nremains uncited as far as I know. Alan Rogers, a biologist at University of Utah,\npublished almost the same idea in 1994 1 and 1997 2 . Neither of us knew of Petty or\nCassel or each other. Both of Rogers’ two papers are included in my appendix.\nPetty’s great idea has otherwise remained unnoticed as far as I know.\nHis idea in modern terms comes from the same ancient capitalization formula.\nSumerian temples knew how to evaluate land as well as mortgages and annuities by\ndiscounting to present value. In the simplest case, where cash flow is expected to\nhold constant forever, the logic begins with the definition\ncash flow rate =\ncash flow\ncapital\n.\nAlgebra allows\ncapital =\ncash flow\ncash flow rate\n. (7.1)\nYears purchase, given those simplifying assumptions, meant\nyears purchase =\n1\ncash flow rate , (7.2)\n1 The Evolution of Time Preference.\n2 Evolution and Human Choice over Time.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 17\nSuppose for example that cash flow rate is known to be 4%. Using (7.2), we would\nfigure\nyears purchase =\n1\n4%/ year = year\n4% = year\n4 /100 = 100years = 25 years.\n4\nThat allows (7.1) to be reexpressed as\ncapital = (cash flow) x (years purchase). (7.3)\nWhere cash flow and cash flow rate are assumed constant over time, they become\nidentical to profit and rate of return. Sumerians realized that return is the universal\nmaximand, three millennia before Turgot wrote that down, and that competition\ntended to equalize it to a current market norm. Then it would also equal years\npurchase.\nPetty was searching for the rationale of years purchase, and found it in the\ngeneration length. Petty’s idea I think, and mine anyhow, could begin with\ncapital = means of accomplishing goals= means of lineage survival= fitness. (7.4)\nNature’s way is transmission of all fitness, meaning total capital for humans, to the\nnext generation. Nature cares just as much for later generations, but trusts each\ngeneration of immediate descendants to know best what their own immediate\ndescendants will need for that long-range goal. Each passes the baton and retires.\nWe invest everything in the next generaton precisely because we care about the\nones after. Hamilton’s rule reflects this reality. Grandoffspring are only ¼ related to\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 18\ndonors, while offspring are ½ related. Hamilton thus predicts grandoffspring to\nreceive investment only when benefit/cost ratio is double. My own analysis allows\nmore role for group selection, without saying how much, and shifts attention from\nwho benefits to when.\nPetty’s idea, if I understand him, is\nyears purchase = generation length = 21years, (7.5)\nwhich would give\ncash flow rate\n1\ngeneration length = 1\n21 years\n= 4.7%/year. (7.6)\nThis would tally well enough with rates of return and interest rates as Petty knew\nthem.\nI would adjust Petty’s estimate of the generational length. Petty’s primogeniture\nmodel may have been true to law and custom for land inheritance, but it is not true\nto biology. I prefer R. A. Fisher’s 3 method equal-weighting all births from first to last,\nand equal-weighing ages of both parents at each birth. We have some evidence that\nthe maternal generation length in recent decades, by that method, has run near 26\nyears over recent decades. If fathers are five years older on average, Fisher’s method\nwould arrive at 28.5 years. Rogers found 28.9 years from other sources. Then (7.6)\nwould give\ncash flow rate =\n1\n= 3.5%/year. (7.7)\n28.5 years\n3 The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection (1930).\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 19\nAll this has assumed has assumed constant cash flow indefinitely. That would imply\nzero growth. Only under zero growth do output and rate of return simplify to cash\nflow and cash flow rate.\nNow let’s model growth in. I divide the Y rule by total capital, as in Chapter 4, to get\noutput\ntotal capital\n=\ntotal capital growth\ntotal capital\n+\ncash flow\ntotal capital ,\nor more compactly\nrate of return = growth rate + cash flow rate. (7.8)\nAt the collective scale, cash flow rate simplifies to pure consumption rate. That\nwould be written\nrate of return = growth rate + pure consumption rate, (7.9)\nas in Chapter 4. Then (7.6) through (7.9) allow\nrate of return = growth rate + 3.5%/year (7.10)\nat the collective scale.\n(7.10) would be wrong if growth rate were a function of cash flow rate. I said that\npoliticians, and even economists to a degree, teach that faster growth needs\nconsumption restraint first. That corresponds to cash flow restraint in (7.10). Free\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 20\ngrowth theory says such restraint doesn’t happen. Data say the same. I apply the\nsame idea in next generation theory.\nMy 3.5% is a rough estimate. What counts is the generation length. The length was\nprobably higher, and the rate lower, before medicine and sanitation lowered\nmortality rates, and let two or three births per couple meet the need for population\nreplenishment.\nThe cash flow or pure consumption rate modeled at 3.5% might also vary for\nreasons other than changes in the generation length. My charts show the pure\nconsumption/total capital rate as higher in the middle part of the twentieth century\nas people drained capital reserves to keep up consumption in times of world-wide\ndepression. I’ll say more about these reserves.\nFirst Interpretation\nNext generation theory says in effect that R. A. Fisher’s version of the generation\nlength, not Petty’s primogeniture version, gives the period of production of total\ncapital. We would miss the point if we focused on the period production of human\ncapital separately. Total capital is our means of lineage survival. This reinforces my\ntheme that human capital does not mean humans. It means skill sets priced at\npresent value of foreseen cash flow. Skill sets are not enough for lineage survival.\nWe also need things. We should not fall into the trap of surplus value theory, which\nhad been taught by communists for decades before Karl Marx joined their ranks, in\nsupposing that skills make things. It is only half the truth. Skills plus things make\nskills plus things as the generations repeat.\nNor should we make the mistake of supposing that the generation length begins and\nends uniquely from birth to birth, so that the remaining period of production grows\nshorter over adult life and the time discount rate steeper. The period of a cycle is the\nsame at any point. The young, simply by maturing, are already investing in their\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 21\ncounterparts in the next generation. Each cohort (same-age group) invests\neffectively in its immediate descendent. Eight-year-olds are investing in the next\ngeneration of eight-year-olds, and so to the end. That’s why Fisher’s version of the\ngeneration length is best. It prioritizes each cohort and gender without judgment as\nto which matter more. The period of production gives our patience horizon. The\nhorizon and its reciprocal, the pure consumption rate, both hold the same at any age.\nCash Flow and Risk\nThe maximand rule notes that time preference and return vary with risk. Return is\ngrowth rate plus cash flow rate. Is variance with risk captured more in one of these\ntwo components than the other?\nWe might intuit that riskier and higher-return assets grow faster on average, over\nenough time for the bumps of risk to even out. But if that tended to be true, the\nuniverse of assets would grow progressively riskier over the decades and centuries.\nThat is not my reading of history. My impression is that smoother and rockier\nperiods come and go without overall trend. In the world we know, then, it is cash\nflow rate rather than growth rate that varies from asset to asset with risk.\nFor illustration, consider factor risk. I argued that human capital figures to be the\nriskier and higher return factor because assets tend to reflect the risk appetites of\ntheir owners. The young are more risk-tolerant, and own human capital\ndisproportionately. If this higher return were reflected in higher growth, rather than\nin higher cash flow, the ratio of human to physical capital would tend to rise steadily\nover the millennia. Most readings have tended to see it the other way around. I\nmyself favor the neutral assumption that the factors keep pace. Then cash flow rate\nbecomes higher for human than physical capital, with 3.5% the cap-weighted\naverage.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 22\nConsider also the history of corporate leverage. Equities are riskier because bond\ninterest is paid first. If equities grew faster, however, leverage would constantly\ndecline. That is not what we see.\nThis inferred concentration of risk premium in cash flow rate is convenient for\ntesting. Growth and return are two of the most closely followed variables in\neconomics. We have no direct measure of the pure consumption rate, or cash flow\nrate at the collective scale. Nor have we any direct measure of growth and return to\ntotal capital at any scale. But we have a good idea of average return and growth and\ncash flow to securities and business assets. By the maximand rule, return to human\ncapital should be the same but for differences in risk. I model human capital as\nsomewhat riskier, for reasons just given, and human capital is the larger factor.\nThen if I am right in placing the risk premium within the cash flow component of\nreturn, and in estimating average-risk cash flow rate at 3.5%, cash-flow rate to the\nbusiness sector as a whole should be somewhat less.\nNext generation theory predicts at the collective scale. Collective return is implicitly\naverage return, and that means average-risk return. My reading of history, which\nrules out progressive growth of higher-risk assets at the expense of lower-risk ones,\nsimplifies that to average-risk cash flow plus whatever collective or average growth\nhappens to be at the moment.\nDon’t Grandparents Invest?\nNext generation theory assumes that each generation invests all its capital of both\nfactors in the next within the generation length. We expect it to do the same in turn.\nWe care about grandoffspring too, but serve them best by trusting and enabling\ntheir parents only.\nA first reaction is that this denies the obvious. Humans today, in advanced countries,\nnormally live to nearly three times the generation length. (3 x 28.5 = 85.5). Even\nretirement at age 65 comes eight years after twice that length. And job number one\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 23\nfor grandparents seems to be helping take care of grandchildren. Doesn’t that falsify\nnext generation theory?\nNote quite. Retirement typically means dependence on savings or subsidy. The\nparental generation subsidizes both the young and the old. Retirees can be\ninterpreted to some extent as hired though willing caregivers paid for by parents.\nThat explains part. The rest, I think, is best explained as replenishing a capital\nreserve. Nature builds up reserves in good times and depletes them in bad times. A\nrise in longevity from what is normally needed for lineage survival is a rise in\nhuman capital reserves. Human capital is the most versatile kind. We geezers have\nlost a step. But we remember how it’s done. We particularly remember how\nparenting and homemaking are done, since those change least with technology.\nJulius Caesar’s nanny, with a few pointers, could probably fill in as a nanny today. If\nthe parental generation were pulled away to fight a war, or rebuild after a\ncatastrophe, we oldsters could keep up the home front.\nFree growth theory, abundantly proved in the data, is essential to next generation\ntheory. What each generation invests in the next is all its fitness (total capital). All ex\npost growth, up or down, is added or subtracted for free. Catastrophes and windfalls\nare the random kind of free growth. Tech gain is the accumulating “secular” (of\nages) kind. I wouldn’t put it past nature to have learned that sustained growth\nmeans rising risk. She could adjust with reserves. We may be selected (a nicer word\nthan programmed) to build human capital reserves intentionally, whether or not\nseeing nature’s motives for the buildup as distinct from our own, when real wealth\ndoubles with every generation.\nThat intentional or ex ante part would mean investment in the reserve. It isn’t\ntargeted to the grandoffspring generation, because they aren’t expected to draw it\ndown unless needed. All the rest of the buildup of human capital reserves in lifespan\nprolongation is best explained as random free growth if my interpretation holds\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 24\nwater. Next generation theory is not contradicted because it describes cash flows\nonly. It treats all growth at the collective scale as free and exogenous.\nTesting Next Generation Theory\nThe proxies for the pure consumption rate (Schultz’ pure consumption over total\ncapital) in security markets would be dividend yield for equities, and interest for\ndebt claims. Ibbotson Associates’ SBII (2012), Chapter 4, shows average real\ninterest on U.S. corporate bonds as 3.0% over the period 1926-2011. Real corporate\ndividend yield rate over the period can be estimated from the same source at about\n2.9%. Jeremy Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run (2002), Table 1-2, reports data\nextending back to 1802. Real return over the period 1802 – 2001 is shown as\naveraging 3.5% for long-term governments, and 2.9% for short-term governments.\nCorporate bond returns would have run somewhat higher.\nGlobal Financial Data shows stock market information for 95 countries. Data for U.K.,\nU.S., Germany, Australia and France begin from 1701, 1801, 1870, 1883 and 1896\nrespectively. My charts and tables, and my website Free Growth and Other Surprises,\nshow this information along with evidence for free growth.\nThe eighteenth century is represented by U.K. alone. U.K. then showed real price\nreturn, dividend yield and total return at 21.4%, 7.9% and 29.3%. Volatility of\ndividend yield was exceptional. From 1801 forward, U.K. averages for these flows\nwere 2.2%, 4.2% and 6.4%. U.S. figures from 1801 forward were 2.9%, 5.3% and\n8.3%. Global Financial Data also shows collective flows for Europe and the world\nsince 1926. Here the figures were 3.3%, 3.9% and 7.3% for Europe, and 3.5%, 3.8%\nand 7.3% for the world.\nModeling of the pure consumption rate before the emergence of security markets\ncould refer to the history of interest rates alone. Interest is rate of return to senior\nclaims. Rate of return to any claim is realization by investors net of all expense.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 25\nInvestors as to interest means lenders, not borrowers. Interest rates published\nhistorically are rates borrowers are contracted to pay. Interest rates realized by\nlenders are less for two reasons. There are friction costs of due diligence,\ncontracting and collection. Default costs, slight when times are good, can be\ncatastrophic when times are bad.\nHomer and Sylla describe normal contracted rates, not realized rates net of those\ncosts, as 10% − 40% in Sumer and Babylonia, 6% − 18% in ancient Greece, 5% −\n24% in Egypt, and 4% − 12+% in Rome and the Byzantine Empire. 4 After higher\nrates in the dark ages, European mortgages and commercial loans found the range\n7% − 25% in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. 5 The range settled down to\n4% − 14% in the sixteenth century, 6 and to 3% − 10% by the seventeenth and\neighteenth 7 . The authors comment: 8 “…interest rates declined during much of the\nlater Middle Ages and Renaissance. The earliest short-term rates quoted were\nsomewhat higher than the last and highest of the western Roman Legal limits. They\nwere not too different from early Greek rates and were within the range of\nBabylonian rates… The later Renaissance rates were well within the range of\nmodern rates and the lowest were far below modern rates in periods of credit\nstringency.” Merchants of Venice in Shakespeare’s time and long before borrowed\nfrom banks, not from Shylocks, and at rather lower cost than merchants of the\ntwentieth century.\nEconomics and Biology\nBioeconomics has meant economics informed by biology. I argued that this\ndescribes much or all of classical economics from Petty through Mill, then lapsed\nwhen the marginalists preferred to do without any explanations or justifications of\ntastes, and revived a century later to explore Hamilton’s rule.\n4 A History of Interest Rates, Rutgers, 1996, Table 4.\n5 Ibid. Tables 6 and 7.\n6 Ibid. Table 9.\n7 Ibid. Tables 10 and 14.\n8 Ibid. Chapter 10.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 26\nI too reason from biological axioms, and from much the same ones implicit or\nexplicit in the classical period. But I end up framing ideas of biology in the language\nof economics rather than the opposite. I begin with\ntotal capital = means of ends = means of replication = fitness,\nwhere fitness is understood as a stock. The concomitant flow and rate would be\noutput (creation of fitness/total capital) and return (ratio of the two).\nFree growth theory gave the inference\noptimum ex ante output = optimum controllable output\n= exact offset of pure consumption, at the collective scale.\nNext generation theory specified the period of this exhaust and recovery as the\ngeneration length.\nConsider Hamilton’s rule in this context. All ex ante output, continuing steadily at\nthe generation rate, must be invested concurrently in the next generation or stored\nfor later investment within the deadline. It is the problem of Brewster’s millions.\nAdults must invest or store as efficiently as practical (the maximand rule) before the\noutput means has slipped by. And the more stored instead, the more pressure to\ninvest later within the deadline. Time left for investment is another of the practical\nconstraints on maximization of rb/c.\nWhat I sense is a watering down of Hamilton’s rule from what seemed logical\ncompulsion a few decades ago to something more like a target of opportunity. A\nprediction maximizing rb/c has proved its value as a useful rule of thumb. I\nsuggested why some nepotism might be more adaptive than none in my review of\nthe Hamilton-Zuk parasite theory. It’s about giving all genes a fair but speedy trial.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 27\nThe quarterback gets three downs, and the batter three strikes, before they go back\nto the bench. Some nepotism directs healthier mothers to invest in more and\nhealthier offspring, and sicker ones conversely, long enough to demonstrate which\nis really which. Males passing the test carry the signs to prove it. Females choose\nthem to spread the antidote gene to the whole population. Losing genes and losing\nparasites retreat until their time comes again.\nSummary\nThis chapter trades my wannabe economist hat for my wannabe biologist one.\nHerbert Spencer called those fields the same at bottom. I never read Spencer, and\nknow him mostly from Bertrand Russell’s books on the history of philosophy.\nSpencer rates a subchapter there. Yet he was an autodidact with less training in\neither field than mine. He even had less training in philosophy than mine. He was a\nphilosopher all the same, by Russell’s tough standards, and knew that logic comes\nfirst. Data eventually prove their worth when it’s time to test. The data I’ve found\nfits net generation theory more or less. What I really have on, all the while, is my\nwannabe philosopher hat.\nPopperians make no sense. Are we supposed to find that a rose is not a rose? Or that\nall reasoning from definition is as transparent as that example? Wiles’ proof of\nFermat’s last theorem ended a search that took some pretty bright minds three\ncenturies. My best guess would be that Popperians confuse the concepts of logic and\nquestion-begging. They are opposite. Logic (reasoning from definition) means\ntaking out no more than you put in. Truism or tautology usually means obvious\nexamples of the same, but sometimes includes subtle ones too. Question-begging\nmeans taking out what you never put in 9 .\n9 Circularity is question-begging which claims to take out as inference what it put in as assumption.\nAssumption that Socrates is a man and that all men are mortal does not confirm that Socrates is a\nman. It confirms that Socrates is mortal if assumptions are sound.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 28\nSpencer’s “survival of the fittest’ doctrine would be a truism if we could prove the\ntheory of natural causality. We can’t by any means known to me. Science takes it as a\nworking assumption. So did Hume, and so do I. If God intervenes only a little, so that\nlaws of nature comes close to reality most of the time, we’re still in business.\nMy critique of Hamilton’s rule proposed that nepotism meets resistance when it\nconflicts with nepotistic goals of others. I proposed a modus vivendi through\nagonistic rules. Hamilton’s parasite theory with Zuk, written 18 years later, gives the\ngame plan.\nNepotism, meaning kin selection through Hamilton’s rule, is in the common interest\nto a point. It speeds up proof of best genes to beat the current parasites by testing\nfemale genes as well as male ones. Healthier mothers and sisters and aunts carry\nmore fitness to invest in more young. And females in most K-selected species,\nincluding humans, perform most care of the offspring and siblings and nepotes\n(nephews and nieces) that receive it 10 . Male competition alone does not determine\nbest current genes to nature’s satisfaction. Female breeding competition and\nnepotistic investment help prove them farther.\nAll agonistic rules are about keeping the contest fair and deciding when proof is\nenough. Long-term success against future as well as current parasites needs most\nlosers, not all, to go to the bench (low frequencies; source demes in my version)\nrather than to extinction. Most losers survived to enter the contest because they\n10 The burden is about 50-50 in pair-bonding birds. Fathers look to be the only caregivers in\nterritorial fish such as sticklebacks.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 29\nwere winners once before. Their cost on the bench, or on the taxi squad, is good\ninsurance.\nMy version of Hamilton’s parasite theory patched in some of Trivers’ ideas. One was\nthat mothers intuiting self-health and good prospects should tend to breed higher\nprimary sex ratios and conversely. Their male offspring can then find willing mates\nif health carries reliable signs as Hamilton proposed. Also the investment of\ninsurance cost by winners in maintaining losers on the bench can be interpreted as\nTrivers’ reciprocal altruism to be recovered when winners now become losers later.\nMy discussion of grandparental investment let still more worms out of the can. It is\nclear that humans in advanced economies today normally live to nearly three\ngeneration lengths. I proposed that we are replenishing a total capital reserve,\nmeaning mainly a human capital one, when recovering from hard times in the world\nwars and world depression. No one really knows.\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 30\nCHAPTER 8: BANKS, MONEY AND MACROECONOMICS\nSplitting up Banks\nI started to write a book on banks and money a year ago. I stopped when I realized\nthat I don’t know enough about the subject. I have some experience and have done\nsome reading in those fields, but not enough to justify a whole book. A chapter, or\npart of a chapter, is more like it.\nSumerian temples doubled as banks, mostly for agricultural loans to finance the next\ncrop. It is from their records, in clay tablets, that we know they understood\ncompound interest and the capitalization formula.\nDeposit-and-lend banks as we know them today emerged in Venice and other\nEuropean cities in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. Chapter 1 said that equity\ninvestors cannot be attracted at leverage (deposit/equity) of less than 10:1, that\neven one tenth so much leverage is unstable in high winds, and that we rebuild the\nbanking system after every systemic failure because we blamed the high winds\nrather than the rickety structure.\nI said that the solution is to split up banks as we know them into deposit banks\nwhich invest in ETFs on the one side, and lending banks which raise funds from\ninvestors rather than depositors on the other. These entities would have separate\nstockholders, and would not interact unless incidentally.\nA different kind of bank split-up has been urged since the 2008 crash. Repeal of the\nGlass-Steagle act had allowed commercial (deposit-and-lend) banks to operate as\ninvestment banks (brokerage firms). Many blamed the crash on that repeal, and on\ninvestment bank innovations such as mortgage-backed securities. I think those\ncritics are looking in the wrong direction. The problem, as with most bank crashes\nover the centuries, was overleverage encouraged by nearly costless deposits. The\nsolution is not to peel off brokerage operations from the mix, but to peel off deposits.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 1\nI see no reason why lending banks should be separate from investment banks.\nRather the depositors’ money should not be risked in either.\nIt is also a mistake to blame Wall Street chicanery. Chicanery is a fact of life, and\nWall Street has more than its share. But I can testify, from a ringside seat, that many\nsound financiers and first-rate economists genuinely believed in the sub-prime\nderivatives they were selling. They were proposed to the trusts I run. I turned them\ndown as a business proposition because I saw too much complexity and no upside.\nBut my read was that the presenters were sold themselves.\nThe problem is not in the people. It is in the inherent fragility of deposit-and-lend\nbanks. Then what would the world be like without them? The answer first needs a\ncloser look at the problem.\nCredit Risk is More than Leverage\nSome leverage is a good thing. Firms issue bonds as well as stocks in order to attract\na wider range of investors. Risk-averse investors may choose the safety of bonds,\nwhose interest claims are paid first, while risk tolerant ones may be happy with the\niffier but more promising equity remainder. Leverage in general is a way to satisfy\nboth these constituencies.\nCredit risk rises with term (duration) as well as amount of debt. One of the most\ntelling points in Siegel’s Stocks for the Long Run is that corporate bonds of 15 years\nor more have proved more volatile in real total return than equities have. No\nwonder. A corporate bond will have ample debt coverage (gross profit/debt service)\nat date of issuance, and an appropriate credit rating. What will both be fifteen years\nfrom now?\nHomeowners also typically borrow long-term. They expect to have children in local\nschools, husbands and/or wives in local jobs, and other roots in the community. But\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 2\nwho knows that husbands and wives will still be married in fifteen years? Who\nknows that if they are, their careers will not have taken them to another city?\nIt seems to me that reducing the dangers of debt means reducing both term and\namount, and that the solution had better find ways that still accommodate the shortterm\nand long-term needs of firms and people.\nNow let’s look at how deposit banks might invest.\nThe Omnibus Fund Idea\nIf I were a couple of decades younger, I would try to create something I call an\nomnibus fund. It starts by seeming to contradict what I just said. I said that firms\nissue both stocks and bonds to reach different constituencies. The omnibus fund\nwould first erase that separation. In principle it would reconstruct the firm as a\nwhole, or put the pieces back together again, by assembling proportionate shares of\nthe debt and equity claims on it in a single portfolio.\nSuppose for example that the market cap (number of shares times current market\nquotation) for a firm’s equity shares is one billion dollars, while the market cap of all\ndebt claims together in half that. Then the omnibus fund, in principle, would buy\neach firm’s equities and debt instruments in that proportion at current market\nvaluation. In practice it could realize the same effect in a simpler way.\nThe omnibus fund would be a balanced index fund. Index funds are representative\nof all the funds in an index, such as the S&P 500, weighted again to market cap. The\nomnibus fund would pick a still more inclusive index, say the Russell 3000 or even\nthe Wilshire 5000. It would add in a corporate bond index, since balanced means\nmixing stocks and bonds, and cap weight the two. The object would be to model the\npublicly-traded corporate sector as a whole. The simplest way to get there would be\nto buy index ETFs (exchange traded funds) directly, rather than duplicating their\nwork of assembling portfolios of the underlying individual issues.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 3\nIf it stopped at that point, the omnibus fund would probably attract few investors. It\nwould offer the aggregate return and risk of the publicity-traded corporate sector as\nif it had never borrowed or issued debt. Aggregate means average. No one is exactly\naverage. Some like me and my father happen to be more risk-tolerant, and opt for\nthe higher returns that tend to come from higher risk. Some prefer the opposite.\nHow can the omnibus fund attract both?\nThe answer is derivatives. Derivatives are obligations whose benefits depend on\noutcomes imperfectly foreseen. I said in the forward that I’m all in favor of them so\nlong as we respect and manage the risks. Equities themselves are the classical\nexample. Mortgage-backed securities give another. Common forms include futures\nand swaps. The idea is about the same. Each typically picks an index, often the S&P\n500. One party, the “short leg”, bets so much money, the “notional amount”, that the\nS&P 500 index will go down tomorrow. Another party, the “long leg”, bets it will go\nup. The short leg gets so much, say Libor plus 20 basis points (hundredths of a\npercent) of the notional amount, in any outcome. The long leg gets the index change,\nwhether up or down, times the same notional amount.\nNo one actually invests the notional amount. It is called “notional” for good reason.\nRather each side (leg) commits a cash reserve, held by the firm managing the swap\nor future, in this case the omnibus fund itself, of 20% of the notional amount. The\nreserve is drawn down to meet payments required when market swings are averse,\nand replenished when favorable. When it falls to 10% of the notional amount, it is\nconsidered unsafe and the swap or future ends prematurely. Parties are warned,\nand new reserves can be committed in time.\nMonitoring of the reserve is continuous during market hours. Whenever the reserve\nfalls to 10%, even in the middle of the day, the account is closed immediately. This\ndiscipline keeps the other party safe.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 4\nRisk-averse clients in the omnibus fund can take short legs, and risk-tolerant ones\nlong legs. Management of the omnibus fund can handle the mechanics of the swaps\nor futures.\nThe effect would be not less leverage per se, since leverage at the individual account\nlevel is substituted for leverage at the corporate level. The difference is duration.\nSwaps and futures are short-term commitments. Three months is typical. Futures\ntrade in active markets, for good measure, and can usually be liquidated in seconds\nat current market during trading hours. So can ETFs themselves.\nWhat do these derivatives cost? Essentially nothing. Those who prefer safety and\nthe short leg are matched with those who prefer return and the long leg, while the\nmanager charges only for its time in working the mechanics.\nWhat About Asset Allocation?\nWhere the omnibus fund seems to violate common sense is in merging out what had\nseemed to be valuable distinctions. So it would seem with the blending of equity and\ndebt claims, but for an optional overlay of derivatives such as futures to restore\nwhatever risk and expected return we want. Many distinctions blended out,\nincluding that one, have been important to principles of asset allocation and modern\nportfolio theory. They are important because some investment sectors are less\ncorrelated than others, meaning less likely to risk and fall in lockstep. Lowcorrelation\nportfolios are better because less volatile as a whole without sacrifice of\nreturn. That’s why hedge funds typically assemble portfolios judged low or negative\nin correlation, and then try to reduce correlation still further with an overlay of\nderivatives. The omnibus fund seems to throw away all these options.\nNot really. One of the lessons of the 2008 crash is that everything but Treasuries\ntends to go down in high winds. Anti-correlation strategies failed when we most\nneeded them. The omnibus fund isn’t really giving up so much. Its exceptional\ndiversity makes it begin with less correlation than specializing portfolios. And\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 5\nnothing would prevent a sophisticated investor in the omnibus fund from\nmanipulating correlation further down with derivatives as hedge funds do.\nLiquidity, Risk and Return\nDemand deposits in banks today can be withdrawn at any time. Time deposits\ncannot be attracted without either competitive interest or quick liquidity. This\nliquidity requirement has been awkward in that bank deposits are usually reloaned\nfor years. A run on the bank soon finds no cash left to meet withdrawals. The runs\ncome when the high winds blow, and provide a coup de grace on top of high default\nrates.\nThe omnibus fund meets withdrawals easily because it is invested only in the most\nliquid securities. ETFs trade in seconds at current market quotations. Any mutual\nfund shares that might belong to the portfolio trade at current close.\nLike most funds, the omnibus fund would also maintain cash. Like some others, it\nwould “equitize” its cash by exposing it to swaps or futures. Equitized cash leaves a\nfund fully invested in effect, while adding instant liquidity around the clock. ETFs\ngive instant liquidity, but only during trading hours. Mutual funds typically trade at\nmarket close only.\nA risk-averse investor in the omnibus fund who opts for Libor plus so many basis\npoints is more or less in the same position as a bank depositor today. She knows\nthat her account will grow only by deposits and by interest (Libor plus basis points)\nleft in to compound. She knows that it will decline only by withdrawals. The investor\nwho prefers the long leg in swaps or futures, or stays unhedged, will also see her\naccount rise and fall with the market. There are infinite graduations around these\nthree simple choices. An account might be partly hedged and partly exposed, or\neven over-exposed to a notional amount larger than the account size where law and\nmarkets permit. (They usually do.)\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 6\nPayment Mediation\nBanks effect payments from depositors’ accounts. An omnibus fund can do the same.\nPayments out are directed “redemptions” in the language of brokerage accounts, or\nwithdrawals in the language of bank accounts. Payments in are “subscriptions” to\nbrokers and their clients, or deposits to bankers.\nAll these payments can be electronic. A payer, typically a customer, might swipe a\ncard or click a screen. A payee, typically a vendor, typically must verify first that the\naccount is authentic and covers the payment offered. An omnibus fund could be well\nsuited to give this quick transparency.\nFirst, it is essentially an index fund. It is composed of a published ratio of index ETFs\nand index mutual funds and index-equitized cash. Individual accounts are then\nhedged or exposed to index swaps or future overlays administered by the omnibus\nfund itself. The fund can track all these indexes online, and knows from tick to tick\nwhat each account is worth. This holds true even for volatile accounts where risktolerant\nclients have opted for long legs in swaps and futures. So long as\nmanagement effects all payments in an out, and constructs each account of index\nexposures itself, and tracks those exposures and payments in real time, it knows\naccount values exactly.\nRisk-tolerant clients will expect daily ups and downs in account size. That means\nthat they will have to carry larger accounts in order to be sure of covering payments\nin the downswings. That would be a problem if accounts yielded zero return, as\ncheckable bank deposits do. The gist of my answer to Milton Friedman was that no\namount of money is too much if it yields as much return as other assets of equal risk.\nAccounts are hedged or leveraged to do so. Omnibus fund accounts burn no holes in\npockets. We do not own one to spend, like a checking account, and treat it as a drag\non earnings until spent. We own it as a fully competitive investment, and spend it\nreluctantly when bills are presented.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 7\nWhy Invest in Indexes?\nThe last section showed that index funds offer easy trackability over market hours.\nWhat are the other pros and cons?\nOn sound microeconomic principle, professional asset management will add value\nover index results before deduction of fees. Otherwise they couldn’t stay in business.\nThe same principle says that the fees will converge to that pre-fee value added. Price\nconverges to marginal utility (value). Investors bid fees up when fees are less, and\ndown when they are more. As a rule of thumb, investors should expect to do equally\nwell in managed or index accounts when fee costs are considered too.\nThe mechanics of convergence is worth a look. Managed and index funds compete in\na kind of density-dependent flux like hawks and doves in game theory. It pays to be\na hawk when the hawk/dove ratio is too low, and a dove when too high. When\nhawks have only hawks to fight, they will win only half the time. Fighting becomes a\nlosing strategy when it risks more than winning stands to gain. More doves will\nmean easier contests.\nSo it is with asset managers. Index funds (doves) avoid commitment (fights) as to\nwhich firms and sectors will outperform. This neutrality saves the costs of research\nneeded for commitment (fights). Asset managers (hawks) pay those costs, and\nrecover them when outperformance results. That means outperforming the index.\nBut if asset managers collectively managed the whole market, they would become\nthe index. Some would outperform others, but the whole group cannot outperform\nitself. Then it could not recover its research costs. Many would have to close their\ndoors, leaving the field to index funds which don’t pay those costs, until market\nequilibrium was restored.\nThen what determines equilibrium? Is the critical variable percent of trades by\nmanaged funds? I thought so for a while. Now I think it’s percent of AUM (market\nvalue of assets under management). My reasoning now is that holds by portfolio\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 8\nmanagers reveal informed opinion on security values as clearly as trades do.\nResearch cost is the same for both. If a manger neither buys nor sells, she tells us\nthat she thinks the price is right. The critical variable is not trade volume, but\npercent of aggregate market cap controlled by asset managers collectively.\nThe number of asset managers is much less critical. There must be enough for\ncompetition within each specialty or sector of investment. Too many is not a\nconcern. Abler ones, on microeconomic principle, will displace the less able. That’s\nwhy Herbert Spencer taught that natural selection works the same in economics as\nin biology.\nA particular reason for preferring index ETFs as omnibus fund investments is for\ncheaper liquidity. The omnibus fund must compete with banks in accommodating\npayments and other withdrawals (redemptions). Popular index ETFs such as\nspiders (SPDRs, for Standard and Poor’s Depository Receipts) are bought and sold in\nseconds for a fee of a couple of basis points. So are Treasury ETFs. Thus the omnibus\nfund might do best not to include actual corporate bond ETFs in reintegrating the\ncorporate sector. Treasuries of equal value should do about as well at much lower\ntrading cost. Easy liquidity is essential.\nWhy Omnibus?\nOmnibus means for everyone as well as of everything. It is all-inclusive either way.\nIndividuals differ in risk tolerance. An omnibus fund provides for all. The portfolio\nof index exposures to riskier equity claims and safer debt claims is meant to satisfy\naverage risk tolerance as a whole. Individual accounts then choose short-leg hedges\nor long-leg exposure or anything between. An omnibus portfolio best matches\naggregate risk and return to individual claims on it.\nOther approaches would work too. A broad-based equity index fund, targeting say\nthe S&P 500 or Russell 3000, could give the same tick-to-tick transparency in\nindividual accounts. Hedging would still be available to cater to individual risk\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 9\nappetites within the risk-tolerant groups. A broad-based bond index fund would do\nthe same for the risk-averse.\nIt seems to me that the omnibus fund would do both jobs at once, and would attract\nmore clients collectively. Bigger is better for payment processing. The more clients,\nthe more “two-sided” payments from one client to another. These payments are\nalways cheapest.\nIf accounts cost little or nothing to open, vendors would logically need no urging to\nopen them. That again favors the simplicity and economy and immediacy of twosided\npayments by including both buyers and sellers within the fund.\nThe omnibus fund is also for everyone as a investor as well as a payer. Very few\npeople have the time or training to beat the market. I myself have not. What we have\nis a sense of our degree of risk-aversion. The omnibus fund gives the broadest and\nmost flexible coverage of risk appetites. It can poll and advise clients on risk\npreferences, and mediate hedges and exposures to suit.\nHow the Omnibus Fund Might Evolve\nI said that if I were a couple of decades younger, I would start an omnibus fund. Not\nto worry. If the idea holds water, as I think, someone else will.\nIt seems to me that banks could not offer much competition. Demand deposits\ntypically pay no interest, and process payments no better. Omnibus clients offer an\ninfinite range of returns according to client tolerance for risk.\nBanks offer the advantage of federal deposit insurance (FDIC). It will not be enough.\nThe omnibus fund carries no leverage, and needs no insurance. As it grows, banks\nwill take notice. They can keep up the uneven fight, or they can join the parade. My\nworking assumption is that many will prefer the latter. Banks are well positioned to\nmake the most of the idea. They have the needed expertise and systems and\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 10\nclientele in place. They can spin off their lending operations as separate ventures to\nfind funds from investors rather than depositors.\nIf there were no FDIC, there would be no deposits and no commercial banks. People\ncan read the newspapers. Anyone old enough has lived through periodic bailouts.\nI’m a free market fan who dislikes FDIC. But we would be rash to yank the rug from\nunder banks by repealing it. We shouldn’t even hint that we might. The world we\nknow is build around banks, and banks are built on FDIC. Let it stand. How can\nanyone know for sure that omnibus funds and independent lending banks will do\nbetter? I think omnibus funds figure to win despite that advantage for banks.\nLending Banks\nThis is the area least clear to me. Banks as we know them begin with expertise,\nsystems and clientele in the loans business as well as the deposit and payment\nprocessing business. That could position them to take the lead in both if spun off\nseparately. Lending can stand alone. There are many lending firms other than banks.\nThey raise funds from investors seeking returns, rather than depositors seeking\nliquidity, and somehow mange to compete with banks today. Lending banks\ndivorced from depositors could do whatever they do.\nIf interest rates must rise because investors demand competitive returns, some\ntraditional borrowers will be motivated to attract equity investment instead.\nCorporations and other firms could phase out structural (long-term) debt, and float\nnew stock issues in its place. The effect would be to lower leverage, risk and return\ntogether. Investors could then tailor risk and return more flexibly by hedging or\nleveraging their individual holdings through professional services.\nIf the same rise in interest rates makes it impractical for newlyweds to buy homes,\nthey can rent until their means improve. In ten or fifteen years their incomes will\ndouble. They will know if they are still married, how much house they need if so,\nand where their careers have taken them. Meanwhile they might rent the same\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 11\nhouse they would have bought. They will not have missed a sure-fire investment.\nThe crash of 2008 showed that houses are risky too. The time to commit to huge and\nilliquid investments, as houses are, is after ten or fifteen years of business\nexperience.\nI see no reason why lending banks should not make equity investments too. Loans,\nconvertible loans and equity investments need the same “due diligence”, or research\ninto prospects of success and return. All might serve the same clients. “Lending\nbanks” might simply be investment banks. That’s why splitting of investment banks\nand commercial (deposit-and-lend) banks may be a step in the wrong direction. The\nkey is splitting off deposits.\nMacroeconomics in General\nSplitting up commercial banks into omnibus funds and depositless lending banks\ncould change the nature of macroeconomics. Macro has meant the art of maintaining\ngrowth and money value stability at the same time. This has proved mostly a\ntightrope walk between inflation and recession. Easy money risks the first, and tight\nmoney the second. My idea is to disconnect the problems of underemployment and\nmoney value instability. If medicine for one has no side effect on the other, each can\nbe treated more freely.\nI would first dissociate money value from money supply. No supply is too large if\nmoney earns competitive returns while we hold it. That was one of the main ideas of\nthe omnibus fund. Milton Friedman thought my early version of this idea was\nanathema. Franco Modigliani liked it fine, but asked tough questions. I’ll try to\nanswer some of them below.\nMy approach to the problems of underemployment and the business cycle begins\nwith phasing out deposit-and-lend banks as I described. I more or less agree with\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 12\nLudwig von Mises and the Austrian school that slumps come from overinvestment\nenabled by overlending. In 1928 1 , a year before the crash, Mises wrote:\nSooner or later, the crisis must inevitably break out as the result of change in the\nconduct of the banks. The later the crack-up comes, the longer the period in which\nthe calculation of the entrepreneurs is misguided by the issue of additional fiduciary\nmedia 2 . The greater this additional quantity of fiduciary money, the more factors of\nproduction have been firmly committed in the form of investments which appeared\nprofitable only because of the artificially reduced interest rate and which prove to\nbe unprofitable… Great losses are sustained as a result of misdirected capital\ninvestments. Many new structures remain unfinished. Others, already completed,\nclose down operations. Still others are carried on because, after writing off losses\nwhich represent a waste of capital, operation of the existing structure pays at least\nsomething.\nHere Mises, writing in 1928, describes the crash of 2008 even more vividly than the\none in 1929. “Many new structures remain unfinished. Others, already completed,\nclose down operations.” These were mostly plant and office buildings in 1929, and\nmostly houses in 2008.\nMises argued that money should be backed by precious metals. He was right in\nthinking that it should be backed. But precious metals pay no return. The omnibus\nfund earns competitive return at the risk level chosen in each account. Accounts are\nowned for performance, and only incidentally for liquidity. No amount is so large as\nto tempt overspending.\nIt did not occur to Mises that divorcement of deposits from lending might prevent\nthe cycle in the first place. Nor did he mention the danger of 10:1 bank leverage, and\noften more, in amplifying consequences of bad guesses. His idea was better\ngovernance of commercial banks. Mine is ending them.\nFree growth theory also belongs to macroeconomics in that it predicts only at the\ncollective scale. It predicts that ex ante net investment, or attempted investment\n1 Monetary Stabilization and Cyclical Policy.\n2 Unbacked paper money. Also called government fiat money.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 13\nbeyond depreciation recovery, is simply less consumption with no growth to show\nfor it. My charts and tables show that this has been true wherever and whenever\ntested, in eight economies over 40 to 140 years. We crowd our niches like other\ncreatures, I think, and have no room for growth except as innovation widens the\nniche. The charts and tables seem to tell us that innovation costs no more in failure\nrates and learning curves that daily coping does.\nMacroeconomics and Keynes\nMacro emerged in the 1930s under the influence of Keynes. Simon Kuznets, the chief\narchitect of the U.S. national accounts, was one of the five economists Keynes invited\nto proof the chapters of his General Theory as he wrote them 3 . National accounts\nwere soon reorganized along Keynesian lines.\nTo read the General Theory, a beautiful work, one would think that counter opinions\nwere led by his close friend Arthur Pigou. But Pigou was already in print with\nrecommendations much like Keynes’ when it was published in 1936. Opposition\ncame rather from Mises, the other Austrians, Lionel Robbins and the Chicago school.\nThey argued that intervention tends to make things worse. So do many economists\ntoday. Keynes believed in fiscal and monetary policy as I describe in Chapter 1. He\nfavored fiscal policy.\nChapter 2 said that he made a basic distinction between investment producing new\nthings and repurchase of things already produced. Only the first counted as real\ninvestment. The difference matters because only the first puts plant and people to\nwork. Transfers neither add nor subtract value. Even so, my own language counts all\nas investment, and ranks investment only by return. I make no distinction among\ninvestment adding new plant and equipment, or investment in stocks and bonds\nalready issued, or in existing structures, or even under the mattress.\n3 The others were Harrod, Sraffa, Joan Robinson and Ralph Hawtree.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 14\nWhat matters is return. I don’t have to specify “risk-adjusted” return so long as I\ndescribe the collective scale alone. Collective return is implicitly average-risk return.\nI prioritize it on the reasoning that optimizing employment of people and plant is\nimplicit, and that optimizing means putting them to work most productively rather\nthan over the most hours.\nIf policy maximizes rate of return, at the collective scale, it will maximize true output\nperforce. Return is output divided by total capital producing it. More return is more\noutput per unit capital. Putting idle plant and people to work, in a slump, is a step in\nthe right direction. But it doesn’t get the job done unless they work productively.\nEven putting money under the mattress is better than investing at a loss. Zero\nreturn is better than negative return. I accept Keynes’ distinction between new\ninvestment and transfer payments. But I see the latter as part of the mechanics that\nends up in the former. Maximize return, and full employment will happen.\nKeynes’ opposition is now mostly the Chicago school and other “freshwater” schools\nbordering the Great Lakes and along inland rivers. Somehow the taste for Keynesian\nintervention resonated best in “saltwater” seaboard school such as Harvard, MIT,\nStanford, and University of California. It is probably no coincidence that the\nsaltwater states are the “blue” ones tending to vote Democrat, while the freshwater\nones are the “red” ones favoring Republicans. (I call myself a free market Democrat,\nwhether or not that’s a contradiction in terms.) Freshwater views tend to oppose\nintervention, but accept Keynesian basic definitions and equations such as the\nY = I + C doctrine and the distinction between “attempted saving” and investment.\nIt is these I question.\nI don’t think much of his view that intended saving (consumption foregone)\nbecomes actual saving only if invested, and becomes an equal amount of physical\ncapital growth if it is. Then (actual) net saving, net investment and physical capital\ngrowth would become synonymous. I said why I prefer a language where saving\nand investment are synonymous in the first place. What matters is rate of return.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 15\nInvestment (saving) under the mattress yields only the psychic value of liquidity.\nActual capital growth depends on rate of return as much as amount invested. If\nreturn holds the same as it was before, growth and net ex ante investment will be\nequal. Growth will be less than consumption foregone (remembering the asterisks)\nif return drops, and more if return rises.\nKeynes saw slumps as investment deficits. I see them as return deficits. Keynes\nassumed uncritically, I think, that new investment is the path out of slumps.\nInvestment will come when prospects of return do.\nAlthough the General Theory was published three years before Myrdal’s ex ante – ex\npost distinction, Keynes would have realized the same thing. I think he made the\nunderstandable mistake of supposing that the difference would balance out as\nrandom noise. The charts and tables show otherwise. The optimum ex ante\ninvestment target is enough to offset realistic depreciation exactly.\nKeynes was a great thinker, a lively writer and a decent man. I happen to endorse\nsome of his policy ideas. So did my father. When I asked him what he thought of\nfiscal policy, I expected something like Hawtree’s “crowding out” argument:\ngovernment investment preempts and prevents private investment. I got a surprise.\nMy father said “When people are out of work, that’s the time to build a new post\noffice.” It is, if you need a new post office, because returns can be higher when\ncontractors strapped for options bid construction cost down.\nBut it is no disrespect to point that the General Theory was published 80 years ago. I\ntend to support Keynes on some points, for example the usefulness of fiscal policy in\nrelieving slumps, but to agree mostly with Mises on their causes in the first place.\nWhere I differ from both is in the fundamental anatomy.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 16\nStabilizing Money Value\nModigliani’s main critique was that money earning full competitive return, so that\nno amount was too much, would make monetary policy impossible in its usual\nforms. My best answer at the time was that full-return money ought to remove\ninflationary or deflationary pressures. But I agreed with him that money value\nmight drift, even so, and that some control would be a safeguard if someone could\nthink of a way.\nThe best that occurs to me is continuous revaluation of the dollar. Legal tender laws\nspecify dollars, or other currency in other countries, as the default means of\npayment recognized in satisfying money obligations. Laws could be changed to\nspecify real dollars instead. Real means corrected for inflation or deflation.\nThis would have been impractical before the information age. The problem now\nseems less. Spendable money, called M1, now means currency plus checking\naccounts. Government publishes current inflation figures online. Omnibus accounts\ncould adjust automatically. They might show values in nominal and real dollars both.\nAccount value would not change. Correction for inflation would show fewer dollars\nworth more each. Correction for deflation would show the opposite.\nCurrency itself cannot adjust so elegantly. It would remain legal tender, but not\nnecessarily at face value. Currency would impose a translation cost on its spenders\nand receivers. Say for example that the change in legal tender laws was effective as\nof January 1, 2020. The real value of the dollar, whether accounts or currency, would\nmean its value of that baseline. Nominal value would be that plus inflation since.\nCalculators or iPads could keep track of the conversion rate. The cost and nuisance\nof this conversion should be manageable. But it would probably reduce demand for\ncurrency where cards or the equivalent do as well. The benefit is in encouraging\nlong-term contracts and saving “menu change costs.” That means costs of changing\nprices. There is no need to change them on account of inflation if prices are specified\nin real rather than nominal dollars.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 17\nPrice stability can matter. The United States has managed to avoid double-digit\ninflation since the Volker reforms of the 1980s. But the danger remains. Modigliani\nwas right to worry.\nA law making real dollars legal tender might prompt better measurements of\ninflation. Many economists agree that our official ones overstate inflation by\nallowing two little for quality improvements. A Lexus or Tesla is not a Model A. That\nwas the theme of the Boskin Commission report to President Clinton in 1995. The\nBoskin panel argued that quality-corrected inflation has run about 1.1% less than\nthe numbers posted in the consumer price index (CPI). I think so too. But making\nreal dollars legal tender, even by these imperfect measures, could still give more\nconfidence in long-term commitments than the status quo.\nSpeeding Up Fiscal Policy\nDesignating real rather than nominal dollars as legal tender would amount to an\nunfamiliar and more direct form of monetary policy. Meanwhile devolution of banks\ninto their separate deposit and lending functions, along with emergence of omnibus\nfunds, need put no constraints on fiscal policy.\nFiscal policy has prescribed tax cuts and government spending in slumps. It\nprescribes the opposite, at least in principle, in booms. A problem is that it has\nproved slow to implement. There is an “inside lag” while government diagnoses the\nproblem and calls for a vote in the legislature. An “outside lag” follows until taxes\ncome due and spending programs are put together and gradually put plant and\npeople to work.\nThe inside lag is unavoidable in a democracy unless the executive branch, or an\nindependent agency like the Fed, is given standing limited authority to diagnose\nearly signs of unemployment, and to address them with tax cuts or spending. And\nthere must be enough outside lag to make sure that the medicine has good\nprospects in rate of return. Return comes first.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 18\nTax cuts can be faster-acting than spending programs because they obviate the\nconstruction period. Freshwater economists argue plausibly that they are likely to\nprove ineffective. They foresee “rational expectations” of taxpayers as predicting\neventual restoration of the taxes when full employment resumes. This gives a\nmotive to save the tax cut rather than spend it as intended. I see it a little differently.\nMost consumption is maintenance or investment to keep up human capital. We will\nneed that earning power when taxes are restored.\nSay’s Law\nJean Baptiste Say, in writings I haven’t read, argued two centuries ago that supply\ncreates its own demand. The logic is sound to a point. The claims on output simplify\nto pay plus profit. The asterisks don’t matter here. Thus pay plus profit is always\nenough to clear that market. There could be “partial gluts” when we produced too\nmuch of one thing and not enough of another, but never a “general glut” where\nproduction got ahead of our means to pay for it.\nAll too true. Consumption plus investment equals pay plus profit. But the sad fact is\nthat profit can be negative. Deadweight loss happens. When it happens, at the\ncollective scale, even pay claims may be left unsatisfied. Say’s law gives no comfort\nexcept where outcomes are as expected.\nTax Considerations\nSchultz in 1962 argued that educational (human) capital is overtaxed. What he\nwrote was: “The established tax treatment takes account of both depreciation and\nobsolescence in the case of physical capital, but this accounting is not extended to\nhuman capital”. He was right. Income tax is charged on net profit of firms and pay of\nworkers. Pay measures gross realized work including human depreciation.\nTax laws now counter that imbalance by applying lower rates to pay as “earned\nincome”. If we could measure human depreciation, or model it with enough\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 19\nconfidence, we would know how much correction was enough. That’s a reason to\ntake depreciation theory seriously.\nMarket-Valued Capital in Macroeconomics\nAnother reason why macro should be reconceived from scratch is that its defining\nequations, written mostly over half a century ago, leave out capital. Change in capital\nshows as net investment, but capital itself stays outside. Flows are considered\nsufficient for description.\nPiketty, a good economic historian, tells us that this did not have to be. It seems that\nthe largest economies had good records of market-valued capital since the latemiddle\nnineteenth century. Piketty does not speculate why macro and national\naccounts ignored them when both took form in the 1920s and 1930s.\nPhysical capital and its changes can be measured at market or calculated by the\nperpetual inventory method used in balance sheets. I showed in Chapter 2 why that\nmethod is not the best. Depreciation accounting assumes norms in the loss of capital\nvalue with time, and gets the news of actual outcomes long after. National accounts\nreported positive real net investment, meaning growth in capital value, in 1929,\n1930, 1937 and 2008. They give little clue to reality in years of surprise.\nThe neglect of market-valued capital in macro and the national accounts until 1990\nor so may have to do with the influence of Keynes. The General Theory includes\nsome hilarious broadsides on the fickleness of market speculators. He put more\ntrust in the sober disciplines of accounting. Piketty trusts the market more, and so\ndo I.\nThen why does Piketty track new investment, or change in capital, by the accounting\nmethods used in national accounts? That seems inconsistent. My charts and tables\ntrack it at market. It seems to me that national accounts should track it both ways,\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 20\nand let each economist decide which version is more useful. Mine, at least, correctly\ndescribes those same four years as losing ones.\nNational Accounts Overall\nIt seems to me that national accounts are doing nothing wrong except in modeling\nthe depreciation curve from misleading sales evidence. Evidence seems to show\ndepreciation as fast at first, and slower later. That tends to be true when depreciable\nassets are actually sold. Structures tend to be customized for their original owners\nand occupants. They tend to be resold when results are disappointing. This\ndisappointment often comes when expectations are first tested. When distressed\nsellers market illiquid structures customized for themselves, prices too will be\ndisappointing.\nBetter to trust evidence of structures intended in the first place to pass from owner\nto owner, as with many standardized rather than customized apartment and office\nand warehouse buildings. Better still, from an economist’s viewpoint if not an\naccountant’s, is to trust logic. Capital is present value of expected cash flow. Its loss\nof value with time, under simplifying assumptions, is the present value of the most\ndistant and most discounted cash flow. Depreciation of structures we keep, rather\nthan sell, is least at first and greatest at the end. It is the same as with a levelpayment\nmortgage.\nNational accounts are nonetheless a magnificent achievement. They need\ninterpretation just as corporate accounts do. That’s where economics comes in. And\nnational accounts are not resting on past practices. They can be congratulated on\nincluding market valued capital, even if sixty years too late, and on extrapolating it\nbackward where practical. This book could scarcely have been written if they hadn’t.\nI would recommend the obvious next step. Net investment should be shown\nalternatively as change in market-valued, and output as that plus consumption. Let\neconomists decide which version is good for what.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 21\nNational Wealth Including Human Capital\nBy definition, pure consumption rate is pure consumption divided by total capital.\nThis can be arranged as\ntotal capital =\npure consumption\npure consumptionrate . (8.1)\nNext generation theory modeled the pure consumption rate as 3.5% per year.\nHistorical data showed dividend and interest rates as more or less in this region\nsince Sumerian times. I model pure consumption as about three fourths of all\nconsumption. I take consumption as personal consumption expenditure (PCE) plus\ngovernment consumption expenditure (GCE) per the national accounts.\nGCE includes government outlays, at all levels of government, on education and\nwelfare. These are easily recognized as consumption. It also includes costs of law\nenforcement, national defense, fire control, and maintenance of infrastructure such\nas highways and water systems and government buildings. These too count as\nconsumption, even if we mightn’t have thought so. They are part of the cost of our\nsurvival. That’s why I agree with Kuznets and tradition, although I didn’t always,\nthat consumption includes all of GCE.\nPCE in 2015 shows as $12.429 trillion. GCE is reported at $2.5855 trillion. Both are\nin 2015 dollars. their sum is $15.0145 trillion. Three fourths of that is $11.2609\ntrillion. Then (8.1) gives\ntotal capital =\npure consumption\npure consumptionrate = $11.2609\n.035/ year\n= $321.74 trillion,\nin 2015 dollars. This rough estimate can be borne in mind when we evaluate the tax\nbase and the risk of national debt. U.S. public and private debt together has been\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 22\nestimated at a little less than a fourth of this sum. My impression is that this\nexposure is not yet dangerous. But it needs watching.\nThe best method to estimate aggregate adult human capital separately is Petty’s. It\nis present value of future human cash flow. That means pay less invested\nconsumption. If I am right, meaning that Farr, Marshall and Kiker are wrong,\ninvested consumption is negligible among adults. Then Petty was right to capitalize\npay with no deduction. And he was right to capitalize aggregate current pay, with no\nneed to model the future. Growth of pay will tend to match growth of human capital.\nThe discount rate to find its present value is expected rated of return. Rate of return\nis growth rate plus cash flow rate. Evaluating human capital as constant current pay\ndiscounted by cash flow rate alone will give the same answer as if we modeled in\nexpected pay growth, but then discounted at cash flow rate plus the same projected\ngrowth rate.\nTotal human capital is adult capital plus that of the young. That part might be\nmeasured at current cost. I won’t attempt either of those calculations here, since\nthey seem to call for economists expert in interpreting national accounts.\nTo Do List\nBooks and papers on economics tend to lead to “policy prescriptions”. That means\nrecommendations on what governments and markets and educators should do. My\nlist begins with getting rid of the double tax on dividends. To get democrats on\nboard, make the effect revenue neutral by raising the corporate tax rate. Dividend\nrates have been far too low for about 50 years now. They should average 5% to 6%\nreal, as they did in the nineteenth century. The result of low dividends has been\ndangerous overinvestment in the private sector, with growth hampered rather than\nenhanced. Charts and tables make it clear that ex ante investment beyond\ndepreciation recovery is deadweight loss.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 23\nI would tax capital gains as much as ordinary income for the same reason. Level the\nplaying field. Solow saw most of the truth, but didn’t go far enough. Mill saw more.\nAnd even Mill stopped short. All we have to do is look at the charts and tables.\nCapital accumulation does not exist. Any attempt lowers consumption with no\ngrowth to show for it.\nKeep track of national wealth including human capital by my method here, and also\nby Petty’s of 1664, 1676 and 1685. What would we think of corporate management\nthat added up only the smaller part of corporate assets? We now consider physical\ncapital only. Political parties debate what taxes and the national debt should be\nwithout the key facts.\nPolicy prescriptions can also aim at schools and what they teach. Macroeconomics\nshould start over. It reached most of its present form in the “years of high theory”, in\nthe 1920s through 1950s, without the concepts of human capital or market-valued\ncapital. It is founded on the inaccurate Y = C + I equation and the concomitant belief\nthat output equals pay plus profit. It recognizes ex ante – ex post distinctions only\ncrudely as to saving, by taking it as either invested or uninvested, and not at all as to\ninvestment itself. By missing the lag between market effects and book reaction, it\nmisreads some of our worst years as our best and conversely.\nThe path forward is omnibus funds and devolution of commercial banks. Bank\nreform along the lines I suggested should need no help from lawmakers. But for\ngosh sakes, let’s not set up barriers against it. Commercial banks and 10:1 leverage\nmake slumps inevitable. Crashes are as sure as death and taxes until we phase them\nout.\nSummary\nMacro has meant a tightrope walk between the risks of inflation and recession. That\ndoesn’t have to be. The problems are detachable. Even today, It should be practical\nto redefine legal tender as real or inflation-corrected dollars. But the deeper\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 24\nsolution is to devolve commercial banks into their separate deposit and lending\nfunctions, with separate stockholders and only incidental interaction.\nIt is best for the free market to do this alone. The omnibus fund could be the decisive\ninnovation. It too is possible today. It would offer clients full competitive return, so\nthat no supply would be too large. It would match bank deposits in liquidity and\npayment services with the low service charges typical of other index funds, while\ntailoring risk and return to client needs with essentially costless derivatives. The\nintention would be obsolescence of bank accounts, and devolution of banks in result.\nDeposit-and-lend banks, inevitably leveraged at 10:1 or more, are the weak link\nexplaining economic collapses about once a generation since the system was\nfounded in the Renaissance. Misdeeds and misguesses and world events were only\nthe proximate cause. Chicanery will be with us forever. Honest bad judgment will be\nwith us forever. Supply shocks, as when OPEC raised oil prices in 1973, will be with\nus forever. Wars will be with us forever. Setbacks for our trading partners will be\nwith us forever. These bring the high winds. I don’t foresee much payout in trying to\ndial down the winds by upgrading human nature. The payout is in stabler structures.\nThe big bad wolf huffed and puffed, and the brick house stood. Omnibus funds will\ncarry no leverage. Accounts themselves will be levered to taste, but for short periods\nonly. Futures trade in seconds. The fund as a whole cannot become worthless until\neach and every security in its portfolio does. High winds and leverage can wipe out\nthe accounts of risk-takers who chose the long leg, but not of those who opted for\ncontractual interest and safety. That’s as it should be. Risk-takers may name their\npoison. Omnibus means for all, and all-inclusive.\nDerivatives are central to the omnibus fund idea. Some see them as dangerous. They\ncan be. They are powerful. But they have a good track record of performing as\ncontracted. Cash reserves, called margins, have proved enough to escape default\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 25\neven in 2008 and the flash crash of 2013. Short legs have been protected without fail,\nand long legs have got what they bargained for. The reason is that margin\nsufficiency is monitored from tick to tick. Checking every few seconds doesn’t rule\nout every doomsday scenario, but gives about as much confidence as we’re going to\nfind in this uncertain world.\nSaltwater and freshwater schools debate the wisdom of fiscal and monetary policy.\nBut both sides frame their arguments in Keynesian language. I find it wanting. The\nidea that intended consumption is either invested or not, and realized in equal\ncapital growth if it is, misses the essential mechanics. It measures employment of\nplant and people in hours rather than in production. This is a good reason why\nmacro should start again from scratch. Another is to recast its basis equations in\nterms of market-valued capital as well as flows. Another is to accommodate human\ncapital, for example by substituting the pay and Y rules for the doctrines that pay\nmeasures work and that output is investment plus consumption.\nNone of those good reasons refers to the possibility of omnibus funds. They are only\na gleam in my eye. If they come to pass, and succeed as I imagine, macro will have\nstill more novelty to digest. If they lead to devolution into separate deposit and\nlending banks, with the deposit banks operating as omnibus funds, good riddance to\nthe 10:1 leverage that has brought down economies every generation or so since\nMarco Polo’s time.\nThe lagged flow method of assessing efficacy of ex ante investment is outdated by\nthe simultaneous rates one outlined in Chapter 4. It should go to honorable\nretirement whenever market-valued capital is available. It superimposes the\ninevitable unintended lag of accounts themselves, even under best practices, onto\nthe intended one needed for the new tree planted to bear fruit. Both lags blur\ncausality.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 26\nSome famous economists are tougher on the current state of macro than I am.\nRecent books argue that it should no longer be taught, and should receive no Nobel\nprizes. My diagnosis is about the same. But my prescription is opposite. Reconceive\nit from scratch, and teach it right. Award Nobel prizes to those who help. My first\nnominees would be Piketty and Zucman. Not that I think much of Piketty’s\narguments. But his website with Zucman is as powerful a new resource for\nscholarship and the database as national accounts were eight decades ago.\nChapter 8 Banks, Money and Macroeconomics 2/8/16 27\nCHAPTER 9: SO WHAT’S NEW?\nTo claim originality in any field is rash. It is safer to say that some things in this book\nare new as far as I know. I know at least what I can’t remember reading elsewhere. I\nam more confident in judging what will surprise in the sense of conflict with what is\ntaught today. There we need only keep up with the current conversation. Judging\noriginality with confidence means having read everything before.\nMy surprises were not all new, and my novelties (if such) where not all surprises. A\nfew ideas met both descriptions. They pay rule, and the equally heretical Y rule,\nprobably count as both although Becker came within a step of getting there first.\nDepreciation theory is likely to be both. Other possible candidates might include my\nobservation that holds by money managers reveal prices as clearly as trades do, and\nmy hawks-and-doves analogy inferring from this that index funds should\noutperform managed ones when aggregate AUM held by money managers, not\ntrades by them, exceeds a critical percentage of the market to be determined. There\nmay also be both surprise and novelty in my suggestion of monetary policy by\nestablishment of real dollars as legal tender. In my wannabe biologist role, I just\nmay have been first to the point out the gaffe in the math of Hamilton’s rule.\nFree growth theory takes Mill a little farther by ruling out growth by thrift at the\ncollective scale. It should prove a major surprise to lawmakers, who incentivize\nthrift in the name of growth, and a milder one to economists already prepared by\nthe insights of Solow. My possible originality here was in the simultaneous rates\nequations I derived to test them, and the test itself accessing data for market-valued\ncapital as well as consumption from the Piketty-Zucman website. My definitions of\nmarket-valued net investment and net output, substituting for the book-valued\nversions used in national accounts, were essential for testing. I suppose these rank\nas novelties but not surprises.\nChapter 9: So What ‘s New? 3/17/16 1\nThe advantage of the simultaneous rates test over the standard lagged flows one is\ngreat. It avoids both lags, meaning the intended one to allow more capital to show\nits effect in more output, and the unintended one in the inherent unresponsiveness\nof accounts to market effects on capital already booked, while also gaining from the\nsuperiority of market measures of capital growth over book ones even when lags\nend. The method itself is no surprise because the math is high school algebra. The\nshock is in what it reveals. Solow and Denison were righter than they knew. There is\nno such thing as capital accumulation at the collective scale.\nRisk theory is probably both marginal novelty and marginal surprise. The part that\nmight be new, although obvious in retrospect, is that assets take on the risk\ncharacteristics of their owners. We knew all along that people buy assets to fit their\nown risk profiles. There may be novelty in my idea that it works the same in the\nopposite direction. Assets once acquired are modified to fit those profiles better. A\nfamily home bought by a drug dealer might become a crack house bringing higher\nexpected return at higher risk of confiscation by authorities.\nThe next step was to connect risk profiles with age and gender. It seems well\nestablished that risk tolerance peaks in the teens and twenties, particularly in males.\nIt drops steadily afterward for both sexes. R. A. Fisher in 1930, and Bob Trivers in\n1972, suggested why. Males, in humans, produce thousands of cheap sperm.\nFemales produce eggs, which are few and expensive because they are packed with\nnutrients. Young males might end up leaving dozens of offspring or none. Nature\narranges competition to determine which. Females are reasonably sure to leave a\nfew. They have less to compete about. As both sexes get past their 20s, their\nremaining reproductive chances grow fewer and competitive ranking clearer. There\nis less to compete about. Risk tolerance grades steadily down with age, and capital\nowned reflects the change with lower risk and return. This gives the basic theme.\nThe next key information was that human capital is owned disproportionately by\nthe young. We own little else until independence at age 20 or so. Physical capital\nChapter 9: So What ‘s New? 3/17/16 2\nbuilds from then on, and peaks near retirement. But human capital grows quickly in\nthe 20s and thirties too, as most human and other depreciation is concentrated\ntoward the end. These are persuasive reasons to think that human capital is the\nriskier and higher-return factor overall.\nThe argument becomes complicated in that most investment in us before\nindependence comes from parents rather than from self-invested work. Parents\nhave a a strong say in what risks children run, so that parental risk tolerance\ngoverns too. But it governs most in pre-teen years, when parents themselves are\npassing through their own risk tolerance peaks. And human capital is probably the\nmost versatile of assets in adjustment to our tastes for risk at the time. Cops can\nbecome robbers at will, and robbers can get religion.\nWe should not slip into the error of concluding that an individual’s human capital is\nriskier than her physical capital at the same time. Both adjust to her current risk\nprofile alike. That’s why the parable of the boss and her secretary falsifies the notion\nthat pay compensates realized work and nothing else. That would make return of\neach in her human capital a little over 100% per day at the start of the last day, and\n100% per second at the start of the last second, even while their security portfolios\nreveal their time preference rates as a few percent per year. Human capital is not\ninherently risker, as hand grenades than nerf balls. Each cohort adapts all its wealth\nof both factors, counting balanced security portfolios as single assets, to its single\ncharacteristic risk profile. There may be novelty, but not much surprise, in this\nprojection of the owner onto the asset rather than conversely.\nThat parable helped confirm the pay rule and explain age-wage profiles. It brought\nanother surprise along the way. I grew up being told that houses are safe\ninvestments. But in fact they are owned by about the same age group and gender\nmix that owns the business sector. The publicly traded corporate sector is a part of\nthe business sector that has given up return for safety by providing instant liquidity\nto shareholders. The notion that houses are safe took a punch in the gut in 2008. The\nChapter 9: So What ‘s New? 3/17/16 3\nnotion that they ever were rests pretty much on evidence bolstered by government\nsubsidies such as FHA and FNMA and FMAC which began before I was born. As it is, I\ndon’t see enough evidence either way to assert whether houses or the publicly\ntraded corporate sector, cap-weighting its stock and bonds, should be risker. But\neven that uncertainly is a surprise in view of what we all were taught.\nDepreciation theory is one of my favorites. It doesn’t upset the applecart as much as\nthe pay rule does, because little economic theory depends on it. I love it because it\nreverses tradition precisely. National accounts model depreciation as declining\nexponentially. I model it as rising exponentially. It’s the same equation with a plus\nsign in place of a minus sign. I love its obviousness once we think about it. It follows\nwhen we remember the present value rule. Once we do, evidence for both factors\nmakes more sense. Depreciation theory rounds out the pay rule in explaining how\npay can rise or hold steady to the very end. And we see the same in businesses.\nGross realized profit, analogous to pay, does not tend to decline as firms approach a\ndate with the wrecking ball. My impression has been that rents go down when\nproperties aren’t kept up or locations become unfashionable, but not with age in\nitself. When it’s time to demolish and rebuild, premises are more typically vacated\nwith trade still running at norms. Gross realized profit is inevitably all depreciation\non the last day, and would approach zero steadily if tradition were right.\nThere may have been minor novelty in my derivation of my three fundamental\ntheorems as at least subjective certitudes following from definitions, and in my idea\nitself of subjective as distinct from empirical certitude. A subjective certitude is one\nsuch that contrary evidence would falsify the convergence axioms. I have found little\nor no empirical certitude past the cogito. I concede that the idea of subjective\ncertitude is impertinent. How dare we infer what people must think?\nWe dare when we infer from definitions. I began with the somewhat unusual\ndefinition of capital (value) as perceived means of foreseen taste satisfactions. The\nusual “means of production” is equally valid, but less suited to my purpose here. I\nChapter 9: So What ‘s New? 3/17/16 4\nthen pictured a future instant’s worth of expected satisfaction. Its perceived value at\nthat future moment would give its perceived value now save for differences\nexplained by the time gap between. I adopted the old terms time preference or time\ndiscount rate to account for whatever they might be. There was no assumption as to\nwhether the rate should prove positive or negative or zero, nor that the same rate\nshould apply to other future instants. My goal was to leave not even the farthestfetched\nof loopholes. If I have succeeded, the present value rule followed as\nsubjective certitude giving exact expectations, though not outcomes, for each future\ninstant and thus for all together. Note that my depreciation theory follows, but with\nthe caveat that the version I have shown adds the usual assumption that time\npreference is positive. That part is not certitude, although neither are we likely to\ndoubt it.\nIt was not hard to derive the maximand rule as the next step. Once we define tastes\nor more generally aims as whatever behavior reveals, the rest follows quickly.\n(Remember that I have no problem with mutually circular definitions.)\nThere were probably a few heuristic novelties. The parable of the boss and her\nsecretary might itself be new. So might the slave paradox with its parable of Phil and\nBill. Many including Adam Smith have pointed out economic inefficiencies in slavery,\nmoral criticism aside. I can’t recall mention of this most obvious one. Bill’s\nmaintenance consumption was taste-satisfying cash flow to Bill, and capitalized in\nhis present value to himself. It is pure expense to Phil once Bill is enslaved. If all but\none of us were enslaved by the one left, national output would drop by substantially\nall maintenance consumption on the books of the one slaveowner.\nThere may also be minor novelty in my analogy between accounting for the firm and\naccounting for human capital in Chapter 6. One possible example is my use of the\nterm “decapitalization” to include depletion and liquidation in sale as well as\ndepreciation. It simplifies to depreciation in the case of human capital because that\nfactor cannot be alienated in reinvestment or gift or sale. One inference was that\nChapter 9: So What ‘s New? 3/17/16 5\ndeadweight loss, negative output, negative realized output and unrecovered\ndecapitalization all mean the same. This is obvious enough, but may have been left\nimplicit before.\nChapter 9: So What ‘s New? 3/17/16 6\nCHAPTER 10: THREE PANTHEONS\nA few weeks ago I was being interviewed about my opera “Usher House”. How\nwould I like to be remembered? With a straight face, I said I would like to be thought\nthe best composer since Mahler, the best poet since Masefield, and the best\neconomist since John Stuart Mill. The interviewer looked startled. Was she talking\ninstead to the successor of Don Quixote, Emperor Norton and Walter Mitty?\nProbably. But not to worry. Fantasies are good things. They don’t become delusions\nuntil we start believing them. What I believe is that at least dozens of composers\nhave the knack. There must be hundreds, considering the terrific film scores\nattributed to names new to me when I hang on for the credits. Each of us, very much\nincluding film composers, gives the world what we think it needs. We like to be\nappreciated, but we don’t give a fig what it wants. We won’t always agree on what it\nneeds. We’ll defend to the death the other guy’s right to his message. But we prefer\nour own. That’s what my answer meant. We’re each the best. But I do have the\ntemerity to limit the list to those few dozens or hundreds.\nSomeone might also be surprised at my choice of benchmarks in verse and\neconomics. Masefield and Mill? A consensus might have picked T. S. Elliot, say, and\nLord Keynes. Masefield and Mill are likelier to be remembered as old-fashioned\nfuddy-duddies already outmoded when they wrote. But that’s me. I am Don Quixote.\nNot a single idol in my pantheons in those three fields was born after 1900, although\nthat could change in economics.\nMy pantheon in music is Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, Wagner and Mahler. Mahler,\nthe last-born, died in 1911 at 51. What about Mozart? Clearly colossal. Listen to the\nslow movements of almost any of his piano concertos. Childlike simplicity, then a\nslight surprise, then another, and all at once we are on a trip through the stars. But\nmy top five show us more. Mozart is too darned enigmatic. He is too darned coy. He\nis too darned third-personal. And I like breaking a sweat. Mozart is uniquely the\nChapter 10: Three Pantheons 2/10/16 1\ngreatest at what he does within the bounds he chooses to set. But I like answers as\nwell as questions. The five in my pantheon give me those.\nMozart is unrivalled at what he does because no one else plays the same game. What\nother composer has put such a premium on delicacy, on poise, on self-effacement?\nThat doesn’t deny that he was a red-blooded mensch who loved hijinks and good\ntimes as much as the rest of us. His Rondo alla Turca is one of many masterpieces\nshowing that side. But it only rounds out the impression of a flawless dinner\ncompanion. A maxim of classicism in the Greek spirit is “nothing in excess”. Mozart’s\nexuberance and hijinks were just the right amount.\nHe was the master of moderation. His operas put passion mostly in the mouths of\nclowns and villains such as Papageno and Osmin and Queen of the Night. His\nsympathetic sorts have feelings too, but keep them circumspect. The perfect\ncompanion cares first about our feelings, not his. Mozart remains that even on our\njourneys together through the stars. We are kept safely away from the heat. We are\nallowed to feel anxiety because the world is so far below. That was half the point of\nthe trip. The other half is the happy ending as he leads us safely home. Anxiety, but\nnot in excess.\nThat shows him as the master of levitation. Richard Strauss gives the example of\nSusanna’s aria “Voi che sapete” (you who know) from Figaro, an innocent ditty\nwhich somehow never lands on the tonic (home note) until the end. The beginning\nof Eine Kleine Nachtmusik (a little night music) does this again. But the slow\nmovements of his piano concertos show it best.\nMozart is not my pantheon, even so. He is moderation in excess. I like the game the\nothers all play. I like a sense of the first person singular. The five in my pantheon\nalso take us through the stars. But they take us closer. We feel the heat because they\ndo. Listen to Bach’s chaconne for solo violin, or passacaglia and fugue for organ.\nListen to the heilige dankgesang (holy song of thanksgiving) from Beethoven’s\nChapter 10: Three Pantheons 2/10/16 2\nquartet opus 132. Listen to the slow movement of Schubert’s two-cello quintet opus\n163. Listen to Wagner’s liebestod (love death) from Tristan, or Mahler’s adagietto\nfrom his fifth symphony. This music plays for keeps.\nThe polar opposite to Mozart would be Verdi. Like Mozart, he is not in my pantheon\nbut close. For Verdi, no passion is too much. He is the master of contrast. He shakes\nour emotions back and forth as a dog shakes a rat. Lull and storm are each given\nenough time to pack the most punch in the other. He wants only opposites and\nextremes. What would the fastidious Franz Joseph have thought? He would have\ncalled the guard.\nSomewhere between Apollo and Dionysus, between relativism and frenzy, lies the\ntrue path. The five in my pantheon have found it.\nI seldom call myself a poet, since that’s already a tad vainglorious. For better or\nverse, I’m a Jack of that trade too. The true poets in my pantheon begin with Keats\nand Masefield. I haven’t found a clear choice for third. There are awesome things in\nMilton, Blake, Coleridge, Tennyson, Emily, Houseman, Robinson, Dowson, Yeats and\nothers.\nShakespeare, like Mozart, doesn’t figure in the center of the picture. I take him as the\ngreatest mind and soul yet known, the greatest playwright, the greatest writer in\ngeneral, and all of these because he taps to the bottom of what poetry can be. “Who\nis this whose grief/ Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand/ Like\nwonder-wounded hearers? It is I, /Hamlet the Dane”. Holy mackerel! But these are\ntouches in his plays. Poetry, in his time, meant something too coiffed and pretty and\nmannered for my taste. You can take Venus and Adonis, the Rape of Lucrece, and\nthe sonnets. That includes the petulant dark lady sonnets, which break the model of\npreciousness but find nothing better. Shakespeare simply came along too early. I\ncredit Milton, in “Lycidas”, for discovering the true vein a few decades later.\nChapter 10: Three Pantheons 2/10/16 3\nThat leaves economics. Here I really have a one-man pantheon in Sir William Petty. I\nsuppose that I am the only person to have looked at his portrait alongside Isaac\nNewton’s, in the Royal Society which they co-founded, and seen the two as\nintellectual equals. Mill seems a clear second, thanks to his superb paragraph on\ngrowth. The candidates for third seem well behind. Maybe Jevons or John Rae or\nLeon Walras. Time has not been kind to the teachings of Keynes. I would now rank\nhis teacher Alfred Marshall higher. I like Myrdal’s magnificent ex ante – ex post\ndistinction. Boehm Bawerk and the Austrian school are underrated. The pantheon\nmight have room for him.\nAm I being too tough on later economists? We should not forget Schultz and Ben-\nPorath. Schultz’ greatest achievement, unless Mincer beat him, was in spotlighting\nhuman depreciation. That left me to ask where this huge flow goes. The answer\nbecomes inescapable once we focus on the question. It gives the obvious solution to\nthe age-wage problem. Everything in this book is obvious. Some of it, like that\nsolution, is the obvious but unnoticed.\nSomebody, sooner or later, breaks the news about the emperor’s new clothes. You’d\nthink Don Quixote would be the last to pipe up. No one in the world was more\ndevoted to tradition and beautiful creatures of the mind. But it takes a fool. He was\nthat, and so am I. Der reine tor. There have to be a few of us always. We’ll get a few\nwindmills before they they get us.\nChapter 10: Three Pantheons 2/10/16 4\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation\nOutput and Cash Flow\nMy focus will be on absolute rather than per capita values. The usual custom gives\ncapital letters for the former and lower-case ones for the latter. I will prefer the\nupper case for stocks and flows, and the lower one for rates. That need not hold true\nfor Greek letters.\nThe total return truism can be notated\nY = !K T\n+F ,\n(A1.1)\nwhere Y is output, K T\nis total capital and F is cash flow. Also\nF = τ +C P\nand τ = τ +\n−τ −\n, (A1.2)\nwhere τ (tau) is net transfer, τ +\nis transfer out, τ −\nis transfer in and C P\nis pure\nconsumption (exhaust in taste satisfaction). Cash flow is the net of positive less\nnegative components. I define them by\nF +\n= τ +\n+C p\n, F −\n= τ −\nand F = F +\n−F −\n. (A1.2a)\nAt the collective scale, where transfers cancel internally, these equations combine\nfor\nY = !K T\n+C p\nand F = F +\n= C p\n. (A1.3)\nMath reminds us continually that “equals” does not necessarily mean “is”. (A1.1) and\n(A1.3), for example, do not mean that output is growth plus cash flow or growth plus\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 1\npure consumption. Why? Output in itself means creation of economic value.\nMathematically, that could include what I called “output exhaust”, meaning value\nexhausted as soon as created. I ruled that out as “free goods”, which happen every\nday but are neglected in economics as unable to influence behavior either before or\nafter. That’s why “equals” cannot mean “is” in (A1.3). And neither does it in (A1.5).\nRather both state that output provides cash flow offset plus total capital growth.\nThis distinction helps everywhere in economics. We know for example that transfer\nout may be drawn either from capital in place or from concurrent output. The\nsource of first kind is decaptialization D. But decaptialization also includes other\ncomponents than transfer out. In Chapter 3, and again just now, I excluded output\nexhaust as free goods possible in math but neglected in economics. That makes\ndecapitalization D the only source of pure consumption C P\n. And not all\ndecapitalization is transfer or exhaust. Some is deadweight loss, defined in (A1.1) as\nany negative sum of capital growth !K T\nand cash flow F. That can show in\nD= D ρ\n+D λ\nand D ρ\n= D τ\n+C P\n. (A1.4)\nHere D ρ\nis recovered or realized decapitalization, D τ\nis “transfer depreciation” net\nof plowback into the same asset, and D λ\nis deadweight loss. λ is lambda. At the\ncollective scale, where transfers cancel internally, (A1.4) becomes\nD ρ\n= C p\n.\n(A1.4a)\nThe dispositions of transfer out may be reinvestment in other assets of the same\nowner, or may be gift to donees. Reinvestment can be interfactor as shown in\nChapter 5. Transfer out from total capital of any individual, net of internal transfers,\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 2\nsimplifies to gift. Transfer in gained by the owner’s total capital, net of the same\ninternal transfers, is gift received. The math becomes\nτ +\n= γ +\n, γ = γ +\n−γ −\n, F +\n= γ +\n+C p\n, F −\n= γ −\nand F = γ +C p\n(A1.5)\nat the scale of each individual’s total capital as a whole. Here γ (gamma) is net gift,\nγ +\nis gift and γ −\nis gift received.\nDivide (A1.1) by K T\nto find\nY\nK T\n= ! K T\nK T\n+ F K T\n. (A1.6)\nDefine these three terms as productivity or rate of return r, total capital growth rate\ng and cash flow rate f. Then (A1.6) can be reexpressed as\nr = g + f .\n(A1.6a)\n(A1.3) combines with (A1.6) to show\nY\nK T\n= ! K T\nK T\n+ C p\nK T\n, at the collective scale. (A1.7)\nDefine “pure consumption rate” c p\nas C p\n/K T\n, and substitute to show\nr = g + c p\n, at the collective scale. (A1.7a)\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 3\n(A1.1), (A1.6), (A1.7) and (A1.8) are alternative statements of the total return\ntruism.\nIn general, define g(Q)= !Q /Q for any variable Q. Note again that g in this book\nmeans growth rate of capital g(K T\n) rather than output. g in macro tradition usually\nmeans growth of output g(Y) . Total capital K\nT\nis the sum of human capital H and\nphysical capital K. Their outputs respectively are work W and (net) profit P. Their\ncounterparts to (A1.1) and (A1.6a) are\nW = !H+F(H) , r(H)= g(H)+ f(H) , P = !K +F(K) and r(K)= g(K)+ f(K) , (A1.8)\nwhere F(H), f(H), F(K) and f(K) are respectively “human cash flow”, “human cash\nflow rate”, “physical cash flow” and “physical cash flow rate”.\nPresent Value and Present Cost\nIf there were no such thing as time preference, present and future value would be\nthe same. All economists known to me concede that we prefer present goods to\nfuture ones, although some like Joseph Schumpter have seen no good reason why. I\nsuggest a reason in next generation theory.\nPresent value theory, understood in essence by the Sumerians, considers what we\nnow call future positive cash flows which are expected to be generated from\nexternal investments (transfer in, negative cash flow) made now or earlier. At the\ndifferential (infinitesimal) scale, we can write the associated future value as\ndFV(z)= F +\n(z)dz (2.1)\nat future moment z. The basic idea of present value PV is\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 4\ndPV(x)= F +\n(z)e −q(z−x) dz , (2.2)\nwhere q is the appropriate time discount rate.\nNote the implication\nF +\n(z)dz = dPV(x)e q(z−x) , (2.3)\nshowing that q is the growth rate that raises the value of dPV(x) to F +\n(z)dz over\nperiod z− x . Since this differential component of asset value defers all positive cash\nflow until moment z , and cannot in itself be affected by later transfers in, q\nsimplifies by (A1.6a) to rate of return. This was Boehm Bawerk’s insight, although\nhe was not mathematical, in equating time preference rate to rate of return r. Thus\n(2.2) and (2.3) give\ndPV(x)dx = F +\n(z)e −r(z−x) dz and F +\n(z)dz = dPV(x)e r(z−x) , (A2.4)\nwhere r is the appropriate rate of return and time discount rate equivalently.\nBut what determines appropriate r in these equations? Rate of return varies with\nrisk among different assets at the same time, and varies over time with economic\ncircumstances. Most sources I have seen treat r in (A2.4) as a variable to be\nintegrated over (x, z). I myself long believed the same.\nMy view now looks to the context. The asset as a whole will typically have received\nmany differential investments before time x, and may receive many after. Each at\ninception will have been priced by the owner’s time preference rate then. But my\ntheme in risk theory is that assets can be traded or modified to the current owner’s\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 5\nrisk tolerance now. She discounts each expected future flow not by her foreseen\ntime preference rate then, but by her time preference rate today. It seems to me that\nthe appropriate discount rate r in (A2.4) is r(x). She will provide for anticipated\nchanges in her time preference rate by factoring costs of trading the asset if\ntradeable, or modifying it if modifiable, into her evaluations of future value F +\n(z)dz ,\nand so from present value too. I consequently interpret (A2.4) to mean\ndPV(x)= F +\n(z)e −r(x)(z−x) dz and F +\n(z)dz = dPV(x)e r(x)(z−x) . (A2.5)\nThe value of the whole asset V(x) at time x will be the sum or integral of present\nvalues of all foreseen cash flows both negative and positive over (x, ω ), where ω\n(omega) is the foreseen end point of flows. ω may be infinity ∞ . Thus\nω\nV(x)= PV(x)= ∫ F(z)e −r(x)(z−x) dz , x <= z <= ω . (A2.6)\nx\nThe terms value and total capital are interchangeable, as are their notations V and\nK T\n.\nPresent cost PC(x) evaluates V(x) as the sum or integral of earlier negative cash\nflows compounded at rate r since moment of investment u, and not yet\ndecapitalized in positive cash flow. The counterpart to (A2.1) becomes\ndIC(u)= F −\n(u)du and dPC(x)= dV(x)= dPV(x) , (A2.7)\nwhere IC is what I call “investment cost”. The counterparts to (A2.2) and (A2.3) are\ndV(x)= F −\n(u)e q(x−u) du and F −\n(u)du = dV(x)e −q(x−u) . (A2.8)\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 6\nq here equals some appropriate r by the same logic as before. Here again, we\nusually read interpretations of (A2.8) which treat the appropriate r as an integral\nof time preference or equivalently productivity rates over the interim (u,x). I\nhowever see dV(x) as determined by current rate r(x) whether derived by present\ncost or present value methods. If the original investor remains the current owner,\nand now finds her time preference rate different, she will have factored asset\nmodification costs into her original decision to bid or invest. If not, she will have\ntraded to someone whose time preference rate is better suited. My counterparts to\n(A2.1) and (A2.6) become\ndV(x)= dPC(x)= F −\n(u)e r(x)(x−u) dx and F −\n(u)du = dV(x)e −r(x)(x−u) (A2.9)\nand\nx\nV(x)= PC(x)= ∫ F(u)e r(x)(x−u) du . (A2.10)\n0\nThese equations seem the most straightforward reconciliation of the maximand rule,\nthe convergence axioms and the evidence supporting risk theory. They describe\nindividual assets over time, sometimes passing from one owner to another, rather\nthan a given owner’s total portfolio. We maximize return within current risk\ntolerance, recognize that it will change, and deduct present value of expected\ntrading or asset modification costs from future value of flows while adding them to\noriginal value. This seems true to life. It allows discounting all expected positive\nflows over (x, z), and compounding all past negative ones over (0, x), at a single rate\nr(x) because of those adjustments to value or cost of flows. Tradition treats the\nflows as fixed givens, and the discount rate as a function of interim time between x\nand z or between 0 and x.\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 7\nMy interpretation that the time discount rate/rate of return we naturally apply in\nevaluating both present cost and present value is our time preference rate now,\nrather than some retrospective or prospective average, might seem counterintuitive.\nI propose it, even so, as the “time discount rule”.\nAnalogy to the Firm\nI follow convention by treating all transfer out as compensated by actual or imputed\nrevenue. The part exhausted in taste satisfaction gets imputed revenue paid by the\nconsumer satisfied. Not all revenue compensates transfer out, as revenue is usually\ndefined as sales proceeds against which prior outside claims must be satisfied first.\nThese are typically for labor and supplies in the case of the firm. Chapter 6 gave the\nlogic in word equations. It begins with\nρ − ρ c\n= ρ e\n,\n(A3.1)\nwhere ρ is revenue, ρ c\nis prior claims and ρ e\nis “earned revenue” as a residual.\nEarned revenue, also called gross realized output, is thus remaining share of overall\nrevenue earned by the firm or other entity that performed the sales, collected the\nproceeds, and paid the outside claims on them.\nWhat the the firm or other contributor gives up to earn the earned revenue is the\nsum of its realized output Y ρ\nand its recovered decapitalization D ρ\n. Remember\nfrom (A1.4) that D ρ\nincludes any pure consumption realized by the owner of the\nsource asset, although that could not apply where the owner is taken as a firm. The\nsum of Y ρ\nand D ρ\ngives its gross realized output. Then\nY ρ\ngross = ρ e\n= Y ρ\n+ D ρ\n,\n(A3.2)\nwhere Y ρ\ngross is gross realized output. In Chapter 6, I also called Y ρ\ngross or ρ e\n“gross positive cash flow”. All mean the same. I will usually leave out the notation\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 8\nρ e\nfrom now on, and refer to gross realized output Y ρ\ngross alone.\nPositive cash flow is that less plowback from revenue. This can be notated\nF +\n= Y ρ\ngross − ρ pb\n= Y ρ\n+ D ρ\n− ρ pb\n,\n(A3.3)\nwhere ρ pb\nis plowback. Negative cash flow is transfer in, notatedτ −\n. Thus\nF −\n= τ −\nand F = F +\n− F −\n= Y ρ\n+ D ρ\n− ρ pb\n− τ −\n.\n(A3.4)\nCash flow F is the difference\nF = F +\n−F −\n= Y ρ\n+D ρ\n− ρ pl\n−τ −\n.\n(A3.5)\nGross output is gross realized output plus unrealized (or proprietary or selfinvested)\noutput. This can show as\nY gross\n= Y ρ\ngross + Y s\n= Y ρ\n+D ρ\n+ Y s\n.\n(A3.6)\nThink of the subscript s as meaning saved or self-invested. As all output is either\nrealized or unrealized, we have\nY = Y s\n+ Y ρ\n.\nThe terms saved, self-invested, unrealized and proprietary will be taken as\ninterchangeable.\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 9\n(A3.6) combines with (A1.4) and (A1.5) to arrive at\nγ +\n= F +\n= Y ρ\ngross − ρ pl\n(A3.7)\nat the scale of the total capital of the individual or any set of individuals. This fact\nwill prove helpful in adjusting the Ben-Porath model and in next generation theory.\nIt should be borne in mind that transfer out and transfer in are both implicitly\ndefined as net of plowback in the first place. Thus it would be wrong to suppose that\nnegative cash flow is transfer in less plowback from revenue. That mistake would\ndeduct plowback twice.\nThe Growth Truism\nGrowth of any asset of either factor is capitalization from outside plus capitalization\nfrom inside less decapitalization. This difference can also be called net capitalization.\nCapitalization from outside is simply transfer in τ −\n. What are the other two?\nOur first intuition would be that capitalization from inside is identical to unrealized\noutput. Here we must be careful. Output is negative wherever the sum of growth\n(net capitalization) and cash flow falls below zero. This “deadweight loss” is\nimplicitly uncovered decapitalization, meaning not recovered in cash flow. To\nsubtract all including unrecovered decapitalization from the sum of transfer in and\nunrealized output would therefore subtract the unrecovered part twice.\nTo make this clear, define positive and negative output by\nY ( > 0) = max( Y,0) and Y ( < 0) = max( −Y,0) = λ ,\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 10\nwhere λ (lambda) is deadweight loss. Meanwhile negative output belongs in the\nunrealized component of output Y s\nas with all effects on net capitalization not\nexplained by transfer in or plowback from revenue. It is the random negative\ncomponent in free growth. Then define positive and negative output and realized\noutput more fully by\nand\nY s ( > 0) = max( Y s\n,0) , Y s ( < 0) = max( −Y s\n,0) = λ , Y s\n= Y s ( > 0) − λ , (A4.1)\nY(> 0)= max(Y,0) , Y(< 0)= max(−Y,0)= λ and Y = Y(> 0)− λ . (A4.2)\nThere is also indirect capitalization from inside in the form of plowback from\nrevenue. The growth truism sums these inflows less outflows as\n!K T\n= τ −\n+ Y s\n(> 0)+ ρ pl\n−D=τ −\n+ Y s\n+ ρ pl\n−D ρ\n, (A4.3)\nrecalling that D ρ\nshows recovered (realized) decapitalization.\nAt the scale of the total capital of any individual or set of them, (A1.5) and (A4.3)\ngive\n!K T\n= γ −\n+ Y s\n+ ρ pl\n−C p\n. (A4.4)\nHuman Cash Flow\nAlthough I can’t recall seeing the term “human cash flow” in any papers or textbooks\nof others, tradition defines the flow discounted to human capital as pay less Schultz’\n“pure investment”. The flow so discounted is implicitly cash flow. I rename pure\ninvestment “invested consumption,” and write the traditional view as\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 11\nF H\n= π −C s\n,\n(A5.1)\nwhere F H\nis human cash flow, π (pi) is pay, and C s\nis invested consumption. The\nsubscript s, as usual, means saved or self-invested.\nPay π can be defined as the worker’s literal or imputed revenue. Self-invested\nconsumption C s\ncan be defined as any investment in human capital other than\nthrough self-invested work. This makes C s\nall investment from outside in a sense.\nBut that does not mean that it is limited to transfer in. There is also plowback from\nrevenue (pay π ), as when we spend pay on textbooks or tuition. I model “pay\nplowback” π pl\nas minor in the world we know, but definitions must account for it.\nThis I define\nC s\n= τ(H) −\n+π pl\nor t(H) −\n= C s\n−π pl\n, (A5.2)\nwhere τ(H) −\nis “human transfer in”. This and (A1.2a), showing F −\n= τ −\n, give\nF(H) −\n= τ(H) −\n= C s\n−π pl\n.\n(A5.3)\n(A3.1) and (A3.2), analyzing the firm, derived\nρ − ρ c\n= Y ρ\ngross = Y ρ\n+D ρ\n.\nFor human capital, this can show as\nπ −π c\n= W ρ\ngross = W ρ\n+D(H) ρ\n,\n(A5.4)\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 12\nreading “pay less prior claims on pay equals earned pay equals gross realized work\nequals realized work plus realized (recovered) human depreciation”.\nPrior claims means outflow (transfer out), from sources other than the direct\nreceiver of revenue, which are recovered in it and owed back to them. Maintenance\nconsumption can be defined as any transfer out from any asset of either factor,\noutside the human capital of the earner, which supports pay in the sense that any\nless maintenance consumption would have realized less pay. This meets every\ncriterion of prior claims but one. Maintenance consumption is the prior claims\nmeant by π c\nin (A5.5) if and only if it is actually recovered in pay or so intended.\nI gave my arguments that it is neither, but is rather exhausted in satisfying our taste\nfor survival, in Chapter 6 and elsewhere. If I am right, (A5.4) gives\nπ c\n= 0 and π = W ρ\n+D(H) ρ\n= W ρ\ngross , (A5.5)\nso that pay would measure and compensate gross realized work. This is the pay rule.\nBy (A3.3), positive cash flow is gross realized output less plowback from revenue.\nThat comes to\nF(H) +\n= W ρ\ngross −π pl\n= π −π pl\n.\n(A5.6)\nNow we have\nF(H)= F(H) +\n−F(H) −\n= π −π pl\n−(C s\n−π pl\n)= π −π pl\n−C s\n+π pl\n= π −C s\n,\n(A5.7)\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 13\nas the application of (A3.5) to human capital. This confirms the traditional view\n(A5.1) if (A5.5) is right in interpreting prior claims on pay as zero.\nIf I was wrong there, and Quesnay and the physiocrats were right, some\nmaintenance consumption would be recovered in revenue of its suppliers. Then I\nshould have written something like C = C s\n+C τ\n+C p\n, where “transfer consumption”\nC τ\nwas the value recovered by suppliers. This mathematical possibility, which I do\nnot claim to have disproved, explains why I do not claim that the pay rule is logical\ncertainty as a whole. I claim certitude only for its most surprising feature: human\ndepreciation is expected to be recovered in pay. The rest follows only if (A5.5) is\nright as I think it is. Meanwhile (A5.5) also gives\nC = C s\n+C p\n,\n(A5.8)\nwhere C is consumption.\nSaved work W s\nmeans the self-invested output of human capital. It includes the\nsubliminal and effortless work of job experience as well as the effort and\nopportunity cost of literal schooling, and also includes any free growth of human\ncapital. Then\nW = W s\n+ W ρ\n.\n(A5.9)\nThe growth truism (A4.3) for human capital becomes\n!H = C s\n+ W s\n(> 0)−D(H)= C s\n+ W s\n−D(H) ρ\n. (A5.10)\nHuman Capital as Present Value\nNote\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 14\ng(F⎡\n⎣H\n⎤ ⎦ )= g(π −C )= 1 d\ns\nπ −C s\ndt (π −C )= !π − !C s\n,\ns\nπ −C s\n(A6.1)\nand also\nf(H)= F(H)\nH\n= π −C s\nH\n= π H − C s\nH .\n(A6.2)\nPay π , literal and imputed, is the measure of gross realized work if I am right in\n(A5.5). I take this as meaning all adult productive activity not self-invested. Then the\nratios π /H and C s\n/H , the ratio of invested consumption to human capital, might\nboth be intuited as biological norms, like the generation length, which tend to hold\nsteady over time. Meanwhile the definition f = F/K T\nin (A1.6) and (A1.6a) is\napplied to human capital as\nH = F(H)\nf(H) = π −C s\nf(H) .\n(A6.3)\nWhat we want is to quantify f(H) in order to reveal H from measured or modeled\nπ −C s\n. Next generation theory measures cash flow rate of total capital, which\nsimplifies to the pure consumption rate, at 3.5% a year as a reciprocal of the\ngeneration length. I argued that the risk component in rate of return is captured in\ncash flow rate, rather than growth rate, that return at any given moment varies only\nwith risk, and that human capital as a whole should prove the riskier and higherreturn\nfactor. Then f(H) should prove generally higher than 3.5% per year.\nThat could give the key to quantifying collective human capital through (A6.3). I will\nnot attempt that step here. A reason is that national accounts reflect pay mixed with\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 15\nprofit when reporting income of proprietorships. I would rather trust an expert in\nnational accounts to tease them apart, and to judge whatever pay should be imputed\nto people in the household sector not literally employed.\nThe Level Payment Mortgage\n(A2.5) gives\nω\nV(x)= F∫ F(z)e −r(x)(z−x) dz . (A7.1)\n0\nConsider the level payment mortgage. F(z) is the constant level payment while r(x)\nis the constant interest rate Here (A2.5) simplifies to\nV(x)= F\n∫\nω\nx\ne −r(z−x) dz = Fe rx\n∫\nω\nx\ne −rz dz = F ⎡1− e\nr ⎣\n−r(ω −x)\n⎤\n⎦ .\n(A7.2)\nAs there is no self-invested output, and no negative cash flow after initial investment\nat time 0, decapitilization (amortization) simplifies to − !V(x). Thus\nD(x)= − V ′(x)= − d dx\nF\n⎡\nr ⎣\n1− e−rω e rx ⎤\n⎦ = F r e−rω\nd\ndx erx = F\ne rω erx ,\n(A7.3)\nconfirming that amortization increases exponentially over the term of the mortgage.\nDepreciation Theory\nDepreciation can be defined as decapitalization which is a function of time since\ncapitalization alone. When assets change hands, depreciation continues unchanged.\nDepletion and liquidation in sale, by contrast, are options available at any asset age.\nAmortization can be given the same definition as depreciation, but is customarily\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 16\napplied to paper rights such as the mortgage rather than to physical or human\ncapital itself.\nDepreciation of those assets is not as simple as with the mortgage. Cash flow F and\ndiscount rate r are typically variables rather than constants. Depreciation theory\navoids that complexity, much as accountants do, by treating each successive\ninvestment in an asset as if it were a separate asset depreciating in itself.\n(A2.5) through (A2.10) gave present value at time x of a differential foreseen\npositive cash flow at future time z as\ndPV(x)= F +\n(z)e −r(x)(z−x) dz ,\n(A8.1)\nwhere the differential present value arose from a earlier or concurrent negative\ncash flow invested at time u < = x . It was shown that all of asset value PV(x) at any\ntime x can be explained as a sum or integral of such differential increments\nevolving with time alone from investment to eventual realization.\nMeanwhile all output within the differential increment of dPV is self invested.\nGrowth dPV can be understood either as this self-invested output or equivalently\nthe shortening discount period, as each means growth at rate r. At interim moment\nt it is\ndP V ′(t)= r(x)dPV(t)= F(z)e −r(x)(z−t ) dt = r(x)F(e)\ne r(x)z\ne r(x)t\n, x <= t <z . (A8.2)\nThus present value rises exponentially as long as the moment of cash flow is\ndeferred.\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 17\nAt moment z, self-invested output ends and all change in value is explained by\ndepreciation alone. It equals the entire accumulated value of dPV at final moment z.\nThat is,\nD(z)dz = −dP V ′(z)dz = dPV(z)= dPV(x)e r(x)(z−x) .\n(A8.3)\nThe following table shows some illustrations:\nDepreciation Factor e r(x)(z−x) if z− x is 50 Years\nInterim z− x (years): 0 10 20 30 40 50\nFactor if r(x) = .035: .174 .247 .350 .497 .705 1\nFactor if r(x) = .065: .039 .074 .142 .273 .522 1\nThis exactly reverses the analysis applied in national accounts, which models the\nfactor as decreasing rather than rising exponentially.\nIt should be stressed that these equations and this table describe each successive\ndifferential increment of outside investment (transfer in), not assets overall or\ngroups of them. If transfer in were constant and continuous in an asset or group,\nother things equal, overall depreciation would show as linear.\nFree Growth Theory\nBy the total return truism (A1.6a), showing r = g + f, we derive\ng = r − f , dg = dr − df , and Δg = Δr − Δf . (A9.1)\ndg or Δg is “acceleration”, dr or Δr is “productivity gain” or “free growth rate”\nand −df or −Δf is “thrift gain”. Divide by acceleration to reach\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 18\ndr\ndg − df\ndg = drdt\ndtdg − dfdt\ndtdg = !r !g − f ! !g = 1 and Δr\nΔg − Δf\nΔg = 1 .\n(A9.2)\ndrK T\nor ΔrK T\ngive free growth as a flow, while −dfK T\nor −ΔdfK T\ngive the flow of\nthrift.\nDefine the “productivity index” or “free growth index” ϕ (phi) as !r / !g or Δr / Δg ,\nand the “thrift index” θ (theta) as − ! f / !g or −Δf / Δg . (A9.2) can then be put as\nϕ +θ = 1 ,\n(A9.2a)\nin either the continuous time or discrete period sense.\nFree growth theory is the prediction that ϕ at the collective scale will average unity\n(the number one), implying that θ averages zero, when ϕ or θ is measured for\neach year or for shorter periods if practical. Thrift theory makes the opposite\nprediction θ →1 and ϕ → 0. The point is to compare simultaneous changes in\nacceleration and thrift, and then find the long-term average of these simultaneous\nobservations, rather than compare long-term changes in the first place. If free\ngrowth is right, they will prove uncorrelated. That is exactly what the charts and\ntables show whenever data are available. Acceleration is as likely to coincide with\nunthrift, meaning increase in consumption rate C/K, as with thrift.\nDivision of (A9.1) by acceleration was not essential to the logic. It added the\nconvenience of index numbers totaling unity.\nThe test should be as fine-grained as practical. If the Piketty-Zucman website\nshowed quarterly or monthly data revealing any two of r , f and g, I would have\naveraged the largest number of shortest periods. What I try to compare is ex ante\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 19\nacceleration, measured as thrift −Δc , and ex post acceleration Δg at the same\nmoment. Otherwise we don’t have the clearest test between free growth and thrift\ntheories. Both agree that consumption can keep pace with output and capital over\ntime. Free growth theory asserts that they keep pace continuously.\nCorrelations tell the same story. Tables show that coefficients between r and g\nrun about 1, as with the free growth index, while correlations between f and g run\nabout zero.\nI do not claim that anyone but Mill and I has actually proposed free growth theory,\nnor that anyone at all has proposed thrift theory as here defined. It is my impression,\nnot assertion, that modern consensus fits thrift theory given Harrod’s qualifier that\nattempted (ex ante) net saving (thrift) must not exceed the technological growth\nrate (warranted growth path). My impression is that Solow and modern tradition\nagree, but blunt Harrod’s knife edge. Free growth theory counters that the same\ngrowth arrives costlessly when ex ante net saving/investment is held at zero. Nor do\nI claim that data shown in my charts and tables prove free growth theory. Rather\nthey demonstrate that all growth has proved free wherever measured to date.\nSaving/Investment\nUnlike Lord Keynes and modern tradition, I define saving and investment as\nsynonymous from the start. I don’t strictly need either term. My “transfer in”,\n“unrealized output” and “plowback” arrive at the same thing. But I know I must do\nmy best to write in a language already understood. I will usually say “investment” to\nmean saving/investment, and will use Keynes’ notation I for both.\nKeynes did not explicitly recognize human capital, although he very probably\nunderstood it. He treated investment in physical capital only. I notate this I(K). I also\ntreat investment in total capital, to be notated I(K T\n). Each, as in Keynes, sums\ndepreciation recovery and “net investment”. The latter, in my treatment, is\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 20\nconsidered in both ex ante and ex post versions. The subscripts xa and xp will show\nwhich.\nEx ante net investment can be notated I(K T\n) xa\nand defined as identical to thrift flow\n−df(K T\n) or −Δf(K T\n) . Its rate is the same as thrift rate −df or −Δf . Ex post net\ninvestment is actual growth !K T\nor ΔK T\n/ Δt as a flow, and !g or ΔK T\n/(K T\nΔt) as a\nrate. Free growth theory, supported by data wherever tested, predicts that thrift or\nex ante net investment at the collective scale sacrifices cash flow (pure\nconsumption) with no growth to compensate. My interpretation is that the optimum\ncollective ex ante net investment rate is zero, or equivalently that optimum\ninvestment is current cost depreciation plowback from both factors. Then optimum\nex ante net investment becomes\nI(K T\n) xa\n, optimum = 0 , at the collective scale. (A9.3)\n(Net) output Y at that scale is total capital growth (net investment of both factors)\nplus pure consumption. Here too we can distinguish ex ante output as pure\nconsumption plus ex ante investment, while ex post output is pure consumption plus\nex post net investment. (9.3) gives\nY xa\noptimum = C p\n, at the collective scale, (A9.4)\nwhere Y xa\nis ex ante output.\nSince (gross) investment equals net investment plus makeup for decaptalization,\nwhile decapitalization equals pure consumption C p\ncollectively by (A1.4a), we can\nshow I(K T\n) xa\noptimum = C p\nas an alternate statement of (A9.4).\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 21\nSummarizing,\nI(K T\n) xa\noptimum = Y xa\noptimum = C p\n, at the collective scale, (A9.5)\nif free growth theory is correct.\nEx ante investment and output mean at cost. They are what we pay for. The practical\nimportance of (A9.5) is as a guide to macroeconomic policy. It says that we cannot\ngrow collectively by attempting to produce more than we consume. We do best by\npaying to produce just as much, and taking free growth as it comes.\n(A9.5) does not say that we cannot influence the growth tides. It says that we cannot\ndo so by thrift. It seems to be me that growth theory lies somewhere in the province\nof historicism and institutionalism rather than in the mechanics of supply and\ndemand. Judging from history, old and new, growth seems to find traction in free\nmarkets where laws and customs welcome it. These are institutions shaped by\nhistory.\nFree growth theory and its equations predict at the collective scale only. Clearly the\nPractical Pig can save out of the dissaving of his feckless brothers, while the\nindividual life cycle is largely a story of each generation giving to the next.\nAdjusting the Ben-Porath Model\nHuman capital begins at zero value at cohort age 0. Invested consumption C s\nstarts\nnow, and is immediately compounded by self-invested work of the young. This\nmeans all work before pay begins at age of adulthood and independence A. As\nhuman depreciation is expected to be recovered in pay, that flow too is put off until\nage A. Then cohort present cost at any earlier age x , as defined in (A2.10), is\nx\nH(x)= ∫ C s\n(z)e r(x)(x−z) dz , if x <=A . (A10.1)\n0\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 22\nI argued that outside investment in human young, including the unpaid work of\nparenting, might not be far from constant. School costs rise as parenting costs\ndecline. (A10.1) in that case gives\nH(x)= C s\n(\nr(x) er(x)x −1) , if x <=A . (A10.2)\nAt maturity (A10.1) becomes\nH(A)= ∫ C s\n(z)e r(A)(A−z) dz . (A10.3)\n0\nA\nH in adulthood is easiest to model at present value rather than present cost. Human\ncash flow is pay π less C s\n. Discounted cash flow becomes\nω\nH(x)= ∫ (π −C s\n)(z)e r(x)(z−x) dz , if x >=A , (A10.4)\nx\nwhere r(z) now is best understood as time preference rate. This is identical to\nexpected rate of return, as shown in the diamond ring parable. Note that there is no\nexplicit adjustment for asset risk. I argue that human capital is not inherently riskier\nthan physical capital, but rather adapts to the risk tolerance of its owner. It is riskier\ncollectively because owned disproportionately by the risk-tolerant young. I treat\nrisk profile as a function of the owner’s age, gender and wealth. (A10.4) describes\ncohort value, and so neglects individual differences in gender and wealth as already\ncaptured in the characteristics of the cohort.\nI model C s\nas negligible in adulthood because I see so little of it. That would reduce\nadult human cash flow to pay alone, and so simplify (A10.4) to\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 23\nω\nH(x)= ∫ π(z)e −r(x)(z−x) dz , if C s\n= 0 and x ≥ A . (A10.5)\nx\nNow let’s add some detail and bring in physical capital. Like most, I model\ninheritance as zero and physical capital acquisition as beginning after age of\nindependence A. That can be modeled as age 20. As human depreciation begins then\nat zero, if depreciation theory is right, gross realized work (pay) simplifies at first to\nrealized work. This takes up all the new worker’s time and attention, yet\nsimultaneously enables subliminal self-invested work in job experience.\nIt seems reasonable to model pay at job entry as equal to the new worker’s\nmaintenance consumption, on the reasoning that independence means reaching the\nability to earn it. Thus nothing is left for investment in physical capital at first. But\nthe quick buildup of job experience soon means pay left for investment. As I model\nno pay plowback, that means physical capital acquisition.\nHuman depreciation rises slowly while the self-invested work of job experience\ndiminishes, so that overall growth in human capital peaks and then declines.\nPhysical capital owned does the same as we acquire it and then spend it on the\nyoung. Young arrive, on average, as a cohort reaches age 28.5 (my estimate of the\ngeneration length). The cohort of adults begins divesting its capital of both factors in\nnurture and schooling received by the young as invested consumption.\nThe young reach independence on average when the adult cohort reaches age 57 (2\nx 28.5). Some young will have been born after parental age 28.5, and will continue to\nreceive parental investment over the eight years remaining between age 57 and\nretirement modeled at age 65. But my model cannot account confidently for this\neight year gap on the whole, or for the retirement period following, which runs\ntwice as long. My hypothesis is that retirees are effectively employees hired by\nproductives to help take care of the kids, while the eight-year gap might show a\nhuman capital reserve against nasty surprises.\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 24\nRetirement can be defined in principle as the period when our pay, literal or\nimputed, no longer covers our maintenance consumption needs. Human capital\ncontinues, even so, as long as we earn any imputed pay for helping take care of\nourselves and others. Maintenance is not investment C s\n, and is not deducted in\nfinding our cash flow and its present value.\n(A4.4) showed the growth truism for total capital of any individual as\n!K T\n= γ −\n+ Y s\n+ ρ pl\n−D ρ\n,\nrecalling that γ −\nis gift received, Y s\nis self-invested (unrealized) output of both\nfactors, ρ pl\nis plowback from realized output, and D ρ\nis recovered decapitalization.\nFor the young under age A, I model K T\nas H alone, γ −\nas invested consumption\nprovided by adults, Y s\ngross as self-invested work, which I model as all work, and D ρ\nas zero. Thus (A4.4) is interpreted as\n!K T\n= !H = C s\n+ W s\n= C s\n+ W = C s\n+ rH , if age < = A , (A10.5)\nleading directly to (A10.1)\nFor adults I model gift received γ −\nas zero. As physical capital acquisition is modeled\nas beginning at independence (age A), Y s\nnow becomes self-invested output for both\nfactors. Let this show as P s\nfor physical capital. ρ pl\nmeans pay plowback π pl\nplus\nplowback from revenue of physical capital, as with the firm. That can show as ρ(K) pl\n.\nBut I model π pl\nas zero because I see so little of it. Rather I allow reinvestment of pay\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 25\ninto physical capital holdings. That can be notated π τ\n. I don’t allow transfer from\nphysical to human capital in adults, which would mean invested consumption C s\nafforded from property cash flow, because I see so little adult C s\n(adult education)\non which to spend it. That’s why I model π pl\nas zero. Meanwhile realized\ndecapitalizaiton is decomposed into its human and physical components D(H) ρ\nand\nD(K) ρ\n. This adapts (A4.4) to\n!K T\n= !H+ !K = W s\n+P s\n+ ρ(K) pl\n+π τ\n−D(H) ρ\n−D(K) ρ\n, if age >= A , (A10.6)\nand specifically\n(A10.7)\n!H = W s\n−D(H) ρ\nand !K = π τ\n+P s\n+ ρ(K) pl\n−D(K) ρ\n, if age >= A .\nNext Generation Theory\nThe period of production, as defined by Jevons and Boehm Bawerk, gave the\nreciprocal of rate of production (rate of return Y /K T\n) if growth were zero. Output Y\nequals growth plus cash flow. Then Jevons and Boehm Bawerk really meant the\nperiod needed for output to make up for losses to cash flow. I call this the “cash flow\nperiod” T F\n, equal to the reciprocal of cash flow rate f. That is,\nT F\n= 1 f .\n(A11.1)\nBoth modeled at the collective scale, where cash flow under the Y = I + C equation\nboth would have accepted simplifies to consumption C. Adjustment to the Y rule\ncorrects this to pure consumption C p\n. That would specify (A11.1) as\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 26\nT F\n= 1 C p\n, at the collective scale. (A11.1a)\nrecalling that c p\nis pure consumption rate C p\n/K T\n.\nRae, Jevons and Boehm Bawerk all got nowhere because they modeled physical\ncapital only. Jevons, in particular, saw the productive cycle as the wage fund\nreproducing itself as it was used up in consumption per (A11.1). He was close.\n(A11.1a) models it as total capital reproducing itself as it is used up in pure\nconsumption. My next generation theory, really Petty’s, posits the generation length\nas the deadline for transmitting all fitness (total capital) from each generation to the\nnext.\nThe generation length in R.A. Fisher’s sense is average age difference between both\nparents and all offspring from first births to last weighted equally. It is a flexible\nbiological norm. It was probably well over 30 years before 1900 or so, when high\ninfant mortality compelled longer breeding to ensure that two would survive to\nbreed again. Contraception, known since Roman times, was then less practiced. It\nseems to run a little under 30 years today in industrial countries. I model it at 28.5\nyears. That gives\nT F\n=28.5 years and c p\n= 1 T F\n= .035/ year . (A11.2)\n(A9.5), inferred from free growth theory, already gives\nI(K T\n) xa\noptimum = Y xa\noptimum = c p\n,\nat the collective scale.\nThis shows that the output we actually control, meaning ex ante output, is optimized\nat just enough to make up losses to pure consumption. Next generation theory\nspecifies that the loss and make-up period equals the generation length.\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 27\nUnder the simplifying assumptions of the life cycle model adapted from Ben-Porath,\nwe would meet that deadline by directing all adult gross realized output less\nproperty plowback ρ(K) pl\nto gift to the immediate generation of young received as\ntheir invested consumption. The young would add their part by compounding that\noutside investment into their human capital at the rate of their entire ex ante output.\nThis would prove the most straightforward strategy to exhaust and replace all total\ncapital by the deadline exactly. This is just as in my adjusted Ben-Porath model with\nthe addition of the specified deadline.\nHere as there, I describe adults collectively and the young collectively. I will not\nattempt to model effects of kin selection in individual investment choices. But I have\nintended to lay a groundwork. Investment, in Hamilton’s sense, translates to gift γ +\nin economic terms. It is a flow of total capital (fitness) from donor to donee. At the\nindividual scale, as well as for the group scale, it equals gross realized output less\nplowback. Gross realized output tends to be a continuous flow, as we see in pay,\nrather than one easily sped up or slowed down. This gives an idea of the time\nconstraints I mentioned in critiquing Hamilton’s rule.\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 28",
