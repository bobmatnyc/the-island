People have told me some of his\nthoughts on background but I wanted to see if he could\ntell me or email me anything directly I could use on\nthe record. Also I'd like to run the information I\nalready have by you or him.\n\nThank you,\nAlexandra\n\n-what is he chiefly focusing on now? Is he spending\nmore time on The Jeffrey Epstein Science Foundation?\nCould he talk about his interest in science and the\n2011 grants/conference?\n\n-How has his business been affected? Is there any new\ndirection he's taking it? Does he still have the same\nclients or new ones? Is it still at $15 billion?\n\n-Did he still work while in prison? How was that\narranged? with whom was he working/advising?\n\n-where is he spending his time now? How has his social\nlife changed from three years ago?\n\n-Is he still close with Ghislaine Maxwell?\n\n-what were friends/colleagues/acquaintances reactions\nto his conviction?\n\n-what does he think about the sentence he got- was it\ntoo lenient or too harsh and why?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031980",
