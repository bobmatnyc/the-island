  "text": "We were as ready as we were ever going to be. We got the final go-ahead\nfrom in mid-February. Our backpacks were crammed full with the whole array\nof equipment we’d designed, commandeered or purchased for the mission —\nincluding a metal detector we got from a hobby shop in Pennsylvania. All the\ncargo except our personal gear, our weapons and our communications\nequipment was loaded onto the cart. A command post was set up in a few\nwooden huts on Mount Keren in the Negev, complete with special antennas to\nreceive the intercept transmissions if we succeeded. Not since the first Golan\noperation had the attention of the kirya been so keen, or the stakes so high. In\naddition to Meir Amit, and of course Avraham, also flying down to Mount\nKeren would be General Tzur’s successor as armed forces chief of staff —a\ngruff Palmach veteran whom I’d met very briefly at the end of my officer’s\ncourse but who I would come to know well, and work closely with, in the years\nahead: Yitzhak Rabin.\n\nThe helicopter lifted off at about six-thirty at night. Compared to special\noperations nowadays, the mission still had a somewhat improvised feel about it.\nCertainly, that was true of the equipment we were ferrying in, and the tools\nwe'd devised to make sure we could get it installed and working. But the men in\nmy team were soldiers I’d trained from the day they arrived in the sayeret.\nAchihud Madar was unfailingly surefooted, whether finding his way alone at\nnight on unfamiliar ground or in a firefight inside a building. He also had\nnatural dexterity. He and another of the soldiers who was also gifted with his\nhands, Nissim Jou’ari, would be performing the most technically delicate part of\nthe operation on the cable. The third member was Oded Rabinovitch. Tall, thin\nand quiet, he was absolutely reliable in whatever part of an operation he was\ngiven to execute. And as my deputy commander, I’d chosen a sayeret officer\nnamed Kobi Meron, who’d been with me on a number of Golan missions. Over\nsix feet tall, he was probably the strongest man in the unit, quick-thinking and\nutterly unflappable.\n\nWhen we landed, we telescoped out the axles on the cart. The roar of the\ndeparting chopper was replaced by silence. Under the soft light of hundreds of\nstars, I led the way deeper into the desert. It took nearly an hour to reach the\nroad leading to the cable site. Though traffic was light, I posted Oded and\n\n78\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011549",
