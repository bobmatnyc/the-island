An\nastounding $1.3 trillion of capital has flowed out\nof China since August 2015, when it broadened the\ntrading range for its currency against the US dollar.\nThe outflows averaged $64 billion per month in\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, China has installed\nanti-aircraft guns and other weapons systems on seven man-made islands in the\nSouth China Sea, including the Johnson Reef, shown above.\nMap data: Google, DigitalGlobe\n\n2016. At that pace, China’s total official foreign\ncurrency holdings could drop below the IMF’s\nreserve threshold of $2.8 trillion by mid-2017, as\nshown in Exhibit 28.\n\nOf course, China’s leadership has not stood on\nthe sidelines. Since September 2015, the People’s\nBank of China and the State Administration of\nForeign Exchange have introduced a series of\nmeasures to limit capital outflows. These measures\nhave included orders to financial institutions\nto carefully check and strengthen controls on\nall foreign exchange transactions”! and strict\noversight of Chinese companies’ outward\ninvestment in overseas property, hotels, cinemas\nand the entertainment and sports industries.”\nAccording to reports, leadership has also ordered\nincreased oversight of trade activities to make\nsure companies are not over-invoicing the value\nof their imports or under-invoicing the value of\ntheir exports as a means of circumventing capital\ncontrols.”? Exports and imports are 20% and\n15%, respectively, of China’s GDP. It is virtually\nimpossible for China to halt capital flows in such\na porous economy without slowing GDP growth\nrates. Thus, China will not be able to completely\nstem outflows despite all its measures to slow the\npace as much as possible.\n\nIrrespective of the success of such capital\ncontrols, China’s growing debt problem poses\nsignificant risks to China’s growth\ntrajectory. We estimate that the risk\nof a hard landing is only about 25%\nin 2017 but will increase rapidly to\nabout 50% in 2018 and be closer to\n75% in 2019. Therefore, while China\nis not a near-term risk, there is a high\nprobability of an intermediate-term crisis\nthat will reverberate through financial\nmarkets. We also know that we cannot\nanticipate the exact timing of such crises,\nespecially given the uncertainty of how\nUS-China relations will unfold under a\nTrump administration.\n\nUS-China Relations Deteriorate Under\nthe Trump Administration\n\nThere is no doubt that US strategy\ntoward China will shift; the only\nquestion is when and how. There are\ntwo channels by which the Trump\nadministration could affect US-China\nrelations: trade and foreign policy.\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 33\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014566",
