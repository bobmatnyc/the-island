  "text": "so-called \"refugees\" — those who fled or left Israel during the 1947-\n49 Arab attacks against the Jewish state, and their descendents — be\nallowed to \"return\" to Israel. New borders would be meaningless if\nthis demographic bomb were to be dropped on Israel, turning it into\nyet another Arab state with a Palestinian majority.\n\nEveryone knows, as a matter of reality, that this is not going to\nhappen, just as everyone knows that Israel will eventually give up\nmost of the West Bank as it did the Gaza Strip. But it is critical to any\nsuccessful negotiation that these two issues — borders and \"the right\nto return\" — be negotiated together. The Israelis will never agree to\ngenerous borders for the Palestinians unless they are assured that\ntheir identity as the nation-state of the Jewish people will not be\ndemographically undercut by \"the right of return.\" And the\nPalestinians will never give up their emotionally charged right of\nreturn unless that is an unambiguous prerequisite to achieving\nstatehood with generous borders. The Obama strategy — to demand\ngenerous borders from Israel first and leave the right of return to\nsubsequent negotiations — is a prescription for stalemate.\n\nThe President also helped cement the status quo by expressing his\nagreement with Israel's refusal to negotiate with a Palestinian\ngovernment that includes Hamas — unless that terrorist group first\nrenounces violence, accepts Israel and supports prior agreements. The\ncurrent position of the Israeli government is to invite the Palestinian\nauthority to begin negotiations now, but to insist, before any final\nagreement is reached, that Hamas either accept the President's current\nconditions or be excluded from the government. By going further\nthan the Israeli government — by seeming to justify an Israeli refusal\neven to begin negotiations with the Palestinian Authority until Hamas\naccepts those conditions or the Palestinian Authority rejects Hamas —\nthe President has made it harder for the Netanyahu government to\nresist the demands of Israeli extremists who oppose all negotiations.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030273",
