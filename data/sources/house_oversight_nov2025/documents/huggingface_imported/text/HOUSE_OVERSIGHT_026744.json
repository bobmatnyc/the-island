  "text": "His rather purple prose still resonates more than a hundred years later. Were he\nwriting today he would have been elated by our expanded vision of life and the\ncosmos -- but he’d have been even more anxious about the perils we might face. He\nreflects the mix of optimism and anxiety — and of speculation and science — which I’ve\ntried to offer in this lecture.\n\nMEDAWAR\n\nBut we mustn’t leap from denial to despair. So I give the last word to another sage:\nthe eloquent biologist Peter Medawar:\n\n“The bells that toll for mankind are ............. like the bells of Alpine cattle. They are\n\nattached to our own necks, and it must be our fault if they do not make a tuneful and\nmelodious sound.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026744",
