  "text": "Trump-Clinton debate.\"\n\nI was joking in one sense, but not in another. Why is the initiative so significant?\nFrom the global perspective, poverty, under-development, and vast inequalities are\ndeep, seemingly intractable problems — and economic development, catalyzed by\ninfrastructure construction, is an essential part of the solutions.\n\nFrom China's perspective, after decades of remarkable growth, economic\ntransformation is necessary, and this includes geographical rebalancing within China\nand expanding China's trade by enhancing globalization.\n\nAll of these can be achieved by the initiative, but only if formulated synergistically\nand implemented assiduously. There are substantial challenges, of course —\neconomic, financial, structural, political instability, nationalism, terrorism and, in\n\ncertain circles, suspicion of China's motives.\n\nBut for sure, the world has great need and China has a grand plan in the Belt and\nRoad Initiative.\n\nThe author is a public intellectual, political/economics commentator, and\ninternational corporate strategist.\n\nhttp://africa.chinadaily.com.cn/opinion/2017-05/13/content_29330010.htm\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023574",
