  "text": "Subject: Filing in Epstein case\n\nHi Prof. Dershowitz:\nI’ve been following the Jeffrey Epstein litigation saga on and off for some time.\n\nWhen I checked the federal court docket last night, I came across the attached filing. It makes some serious\nallegations about you and several other people related to the case.\n\nI wanted to make sure you had a copy of the filing and to ask if you have any comments on the allegations\nraised in it.\n\nI’m planning to write a blog entry or story on this and will probably do so fairly soon since the filing is a\npublic record at this point.\n\nAnyway, if you want to respond, please let me know as soon as possible.\nThanks\n--Josh Gerstein\n\nJosh Gerstein\nReporter\nPOLITICO\n\na)\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
