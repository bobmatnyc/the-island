Morgan for $10 per share\nin a transaction that many mark as the beginning of, what we now\nknow as, the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. While it is said that\n\nthe passage of time heals all wounds, the disastrous contagion\nacross the global financial landscape, the collapse of numerous\nlarge financial institutions and the loss of public trust in the\nfinancial services sector remains on the minds of many. Whether it\nwas opaque counterparty exposure, excessive leverage, insufficient\nrisk management, or a lack of corporate transparency, we now\nknow that these factors in combination led to the near collapse\nof the entire global financial system. While the financial markets\nhave moved well beyond that terrible day in March of 2008, the\npublic trust of a very large sector of the global economy is still\nseverely marred due to continued bad behavior, lack of corporate\ntransparency, accountability and proper risk management, as well\nas risky business practices.\n\nACTIVE STEWARDSHIP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012073",
