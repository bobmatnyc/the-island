  "text": "54010\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nStatutory Authority, below, the Board\nbelieves that it has been Congressionally\nauthorized to make this regulatory\ndecision in the interests of carrying out\nthe provisions of the Act.\n\nMany comments argue that the Board\nshould heed the use of the word\n“necessary” in Section 6. For instance,\nthe Portland Cement Association\ncomments that Section 6 requires the\nBoard to demonstrate that: (1) The\nspecific rule being proposed is, in fact,\nnecessary, and (2) the adoption of the\nproposed rule will carry out one or more\nspecific provisions of the Act.?9 The\nBoard believes, for the reasons\nexpressed in subsection C, Factual\nSupport, below, that the requisite\nshowing of necessity has been made.\nAnd, as explained below, the adoption\nof the proposed rule is consistent with\nSection 1 and will help effectuate\nSections 7, 8, 9 and 10 of the NLRA.\n\nThe Board, however, disagrees with\nthe Motor & Equipment Manufacturers\nAssociation’s assertion based upon the\ncase of West Virginia State Board of\nEducation v. Barnette *° that the Board\nneeds to show “‘a grave and immediate\ndanger’’ before enacting a rule. First,\nthat case held that that very rigorous\nstandard of review is required only\nwhere a First Amendment freedom is\nalleged to have been infringed. The\nCourt further noted that where the First\nAmendment is not implicated, the\ngovernment may regulate an area so\nlong as it has a “‘rational basis” for\ndoing so. As explained in subsection B,\nStatutory Authority, below, this rule\ninfringes upon no First Amendment\ninterests, and consequently, the rule\nshould be judged on a standard similar\nto the “rational basis” test laid out in\nBarnette. It was in fact just such a\ndeferential standard which the Supreme\nCourt used to examine the Board’s\nhealth care rule in AHA. There, the\nCourt found that even if it read Section\n9 to find any ambiguity, it still would\nhave deferred to the Board’s “reasonable\ninterpretation of the statutory text,” and\nfound the Board authorized under\nSections 6 and 9 to enact the health care\nbargaining unit rule at issue.41 No\n“orave and immediate danger’ was\nfound to be required prior to the Board\nenacting that rule. This ruling was also\nconsistent with the Supreme Court’s\nearlier holdings in Thorpe and\nMourning, in which regulations\npromulgated under broadly phrased\ngrants of authority needed to be only\n\n39 See also comment of Americans for Limited\nGovernment, citing to AFL-CIO v. Chao, 409 F.3d\n377, 391 (D.C. Cir. 2005) for the same principle.\n\n40319 U.S. 624, 639 (1943).\n\n41499 U.S. at 614.\n\n“reasonably related to the purposes of\nthe enabling legislation.” 42 For the\nreasons shown below, that standard is\nmore than met in the present rule.\n\nB. The Board’s Statutory Authority To\nIssue This Rule\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act\ndoes not directly address an employer’s\nobligation to post a notice of its\nemployees’ rights arising under the Act\nor the consequences an employer may\nface for failing to do so. However, as\nstated, NLRA Section 6 empowers the\nBoard to promulgate legislative rules “‘as\nmay be necessary to carry out the\nprovisions” of the Act. 29 U.S.C. 156. A\ndetermination of necessity under\nSection 6 made by the Board, as\nadministrator of the NLRA, is entitled to\ndeference. See Ragsdale v. Wolverine\nWorld Wide, Inc., 535 U.S. 81, 86 (2002).\n\nFurthermore, even in the absence of\nexpress rulemaking authority, “the\npower of an administrative agency to\nadminister a congressionally created\n* * * program necessarily requires the\nformulation of policy and the making of\nrules to fill any gap left, implicitly or\nexplicitly, by Congress.”’ Morton v. Ruiz,\n415 U.S. 199, 231 (1974). Under the\nwell-known test articulated by the\nSupreme Court in Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v.\nNatural Resources Defense Council,\nInc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), courts will\ndefer to the Board’s reasonable\ninterpretation of a gap left by Congress\nin the NLRA.\n\nAn examination of the provisions of\nthe whole law demonstrate how the\nnotice-posting rule is a legitimate\nexercise of both legislative rulemaking\nauthority under Section 6 and implied\ngap-filling authority under Chevron, 467\nU.S. at 843. Section 1 of the NLRA\nexplains that Congress deliberately\nchose the means of “encouraging the\npractice and procedure of collective\nbargaining” and ‘protecting the exercise\nof workers of full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their\nown choosing” in order to combat the\nsubstantial burdens on commerce\ncaused by certain employer and labor\nunion practices as well as by the\ninherent “inequality of bargaining\npower between employees * * * and\nemployers.” 29 U.S.C. 151.48 Section 7\n\n42 Mourning, 411 U.S. at 369 (quoting Thorpe, 393\nU.S. at 280-81).\n\n43 These regulations are entirely compatible with\nthe national labor policy, as expressed in Section\n1, “to eliminate the causes of certain substantial\nobstructions to the free flow of commerce and to\nmitigate and eliminate these obstructions when\nthey have occurred.” 29 U.S.C. 151 (fifth\nparagraph). As explained below, the Board’s ability\nto “eliminate” the causes of labor strife and\ndepressed wage rates, ‘““which have the intent or\n\ntherefore sets forth the core rights of\nemployees ‘“‘to self-organization’’; “to\nform, join, or assist labor organizations”;\n“to bargain collectively”; and “to engage\nin other concerted activities’; as well as\nthe right “to refrain from any or all such\nactivities.” Id. § 157. Section 8 defines\nand prohibits union and employer\n“unfair labor practices” that infringe on\nemployees’ Section 7 rights, id. § 158,\nand Section 10 authorizes the Board to\nadjudicate unfair labor practice claims,\nid. § 160, subject to the NLRA’s\nprocedural six-month statute of\nlimitations, see Zipes v. Trans World\nAirlines, Inc., 455 U.S. 385, 395 n.11\n(1982). Finally, Section 9 authorizes the\nBoard to conduct representation\nelections and issue certifications. 29\nU.S.C. 159.\n\nNotably, the NLRA does not give the\nBoard or its General Counsel roving\ninvestigatory powers. Although the\nBoard is specifically empowered to\n“prevent” unfair labor practices, id.\n\n§ 160(a), “[t]he Board may not act until\nan unfair labor practice charge is filed\n* * * alleging a violation of the Act.”\n2 The Developing Labor Law 2683 John\nE. Higgins, Jr. ed., 5th ed. 2006). In\naddition, certification “procedures are\nset in motion with the filing of a\nrepresentation petition.” Jd. at 2662. In\nboth instances, the initiating document\nis filed by a private party. Id. at 2683\n(citing 29 CFR 102.9); id. at 2662-63\n(citing 29 U.S.C. 159(c)(1)(A), (B), and\n(e)(1)).\n\nEnforcement of the NLRA and\neffectuation of Congress’s national labor\npolicy therefore depend on the\nexistence of outside actors who are not\nonly aware of their rights but also know\nwhere they may seek to vindicate them\nwithin appropriate timeframes. The\nDepartment of Labor made a similar\nfinding in an analogous rulemaking\nproceeding under the Fair Labor\nStandards Act: “effective enforcement of\nthe [FLSA] depends to a great extent\nupon knowledge on the part of covered\nemployees of the provisions of the act\nand the applicability of such provisions\nto them, and a greater degree of\ncompliance with the act has been\neffected in situations where employees\nare aware of their rights under the law.”’\n14 FR 7516, 7516 (Dec. 16, 1949). Given\nthe direct relationship between\nemployees’ timely awareness of their\nrights under the NLRA and the Board’s\n\nnecessary effect of burdening or obstructing\ncommerce,” id., depends on workers’ knowledge of\ntheir rights and the protections provided by the\nNLRB. The Board therefore rejects the argument of\nthe Manufacturer’s Association of South Central\nPennsylvania that both the notice-posting rule and\nthe Board’s general assertion of rulemaking\nauthority are inconsistent with Section 1.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022281",
