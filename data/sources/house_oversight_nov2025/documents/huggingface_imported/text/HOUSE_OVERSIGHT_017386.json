  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nThe issues raised by the Delphic decision in Bakke continue to challenge the courts and the\nconstitution. As I write these words, the Supreme Court has agreed to review yet another\naffirmative action program. The issues may be similar to that raised in Bakke and subsequent\ncases, but the personnel on the court has changed. Stay tuned.\n\nMy principled opposition to race-based decision making has been softened somewhat by\nexperience. I have seen it work in practice. First and foremost, it has helped produce a new\ngeneration of remarkable Black leaders, many of whom were my students and remain my friends\nand colleagues. This has changed the face of America — and the world. Second, it did not have\nthe feared negative impact on the admission of Jewish students. Jewish leaders were\nappropriately concerned that the “Black places” would be taken from the hard-earned “Jewish\nplaces,” because colleges like Harvard and Yale would never reduce the number of White Anglo\nSaxon Protestants, who were the “backbone” and the “heritage” of these schools. Well, that\nturned out to be wrong. There has been a significant decrease in the number of “WASPs”\nadmitted to elite schools. The “donuts”, it turns out, have not only been “bagels;” they have\nincluded white bread. Put another way, Jews have become WASPs, when it comes to admissions.\nMany Jewish applicants are now “legacies” who are given an advantage in admission. It may still\nbe a bit more difficult, all things being equal, for a Jewish non-legacy applicant to be admitted,\nbecause all colleges seek “diversity”, but the number of Jewish admittees remains high. So it has\nbeen a win-win, rather than a zero sum game, at least as far as Blacks and Jews are concerned.\nThere may still be implicit ceilings for some Asian applicants to some schools, but that may be\nbecause there are so many qualified Asian-American applicants as well as applicants from many\nAsian countries. The donuts therefore include “nan” and dim sum.\n\nMy philosophy of life has always been that experience is the primary source of our morality — that\nrights come from wrongs. Rights also come from a recognition that they may not produce the\nwrongs that are feared. It should not be surprising therefore that based on experience I have\nchanged my views somewhat on the propriety of race-based decisions. It would also not be\nsurprising if, in the future, I changed my views again, as many African-Americans secure greater\npower, influence, and privilege in America. It may become necessary at that point — a point we\nmay not have reached— to base affirmative action programs more on class and other relevant\nfactors than on race alone.\n\nIn sum, therefore, my views regarding equality have not changed over the years, since equality is a\nprinciple and in my view an enduring and never changing goal. The means by which we seek to\nachieve the goal of equality will vary over time and place with experience. The ongoing\nexperiment with various types of affirmative action programs will never provide a perfect solution\nto an extraordinary complex problem, but I believe we are moving in the right direction.\n\n299\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017386",
