Whitley \nAlston & Bird LLP \nThe Atlantic Building \n950 F Street, NW \nWashington. DC 20004-1404 \nVIA FACSIMILE CONFIDENTIAL \nHonorable Mark Filip \nOffice of the Deputy Attorney General \nUnited States Department of Justice \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20530 \nDear Judge Filip: \nThis letter briefly supplements our prior submission to you dated May 19, 2008. In that \ncommunication, we urgently requested that your Office conduct an independent review of the \nproposed federal prosecution of our client, Jeffrey Epstein. The dual reasons for our request that \nyou review this matter are (i) the bedrock need for integrity in the enforcement of federal \ncriminal laws, and (ii) the profound questions raised by the unprecedented extension of federal \nlaw by the United States Attorney's Office in Miami (the \"USAO\") to a prominent public figure \nwho has close ties to former President Clinton. \nThe need for review is now all the more exigent. On Monday, May 19, 2008, First \nAssistant Jeffrey Sloman of the USAO responded to an email from Jay Lefkowitz informing U.S. \nAttorney Alex Acosta that we would be seeking your Office's review. Mr. Sloman's letter, \nwhich imposed a deadline of June 2, 2008 to comply with all the terms of the current Non-\nProsecution Agreement (the \"Agreement\"), plus new unilateral modifications, on pain of being \ndeemed in breach of that Agreement, appears to have been deliberately designed to deprive us of \nan adequate opportunity to seek your Office's review in this matter. \nThe USAO's desire to foreclose a complete review is understandable, given that the \nChild Exploitation and Obscenity Section (\"CEOS\") has already determined that our substantive \narguments regarding why a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is not warranted were \n\"compelling.\" However, in contradiction to Mr. Sloman's assertion that CEOS had provided an \nindependent, de novo review, CEOS made clear that it did not do so. Indeed, CEOS declined to \nexamine several of the more troubling aspects of the investigation of Mr. Epstein, including the \ndeliberate leak to the New York Times of numerous highly confidential aspects of the \ninvestigation and negotiations between the parties as well as the recent crop of civil lawsuits \nfiled against Mr. Epstein by Mr. Sloman's former law partner. \nThe unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed deadline set by the USAO was done without any \nrespect for the normal functioning and scheduling of state judicial matters. It requires that \nMr. Epstein's counsel persuade the State Attorney of Palm Beach to issue a criminal information \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019221 \nHonorable Mark Filip \nMay 27, 2008 \nPage 2 \nto a charge that the State Attorney has not, despite a two year investigation, determined to be \nappropriate. Mr. Epstein's counsel must also successfully expedite a plea of guilty to this charge \non a date prior to July 8, 2008, which is the date presently set by the state court Judge. \nFurther, the unnecessary deadline is even more problematic because Mr. Epstein's effort \nto reconcile the state charge and sentence with the terms of the Agreement requires an unusual \nand unprecedented threatened application of federal law. Thus, it places Mr. Epstein in the \nhighly unusual position of having to demand that the State acquiesce to a more severe \npunishment than it had already determined was appropriate. \nWe have attempted to resolve these and other issues through the USA() and CEOS, \nincluding raising our concerns about the USAO's inappropriate conduct with respect to this \nmatter. But those avenues have now been shut down. Mr. Sloman's letter purports to prohibit \nany further contact between Mr. Epstein's defense team and U.S. Attorney Acosta, and instead \nrequires us to communicate with the USA() only though Mr. Sloman's subordinates. \nWhile it pains us to say this, this misguided prosecution from the outset gives the \nappearance that it may have been politically motivated. Mr. Epstein is a highly successful, self-\nmade businessman and philanthropist who entered the public arena only by virtue of his close \npersonal association with former President Bill Clinton. There is little doubt in our minds that \nthe USA() never would have contemplated a prosecution in this case if Mr. Epstein were just \nanother \"John.\" \nU.S. Attorney Acosta previously has stated that he is \"sympathetic\" to our federalism-\nrelated concerns, but he has taken the position that his authority is limited by enforcement \npolicies set forth in Washington, D.C. As expressed in our prior communication to you, we \nbelieve that a complete and independent appraisal and resolution of this case most appropriately \nwould be undertaken by your Office—beginning with the rescission of the arbitrary, unfair, and \nunprecedented deadline that Mr. Sloman demands to have imposed in this case. At the very \nleast, we would appreciate a tolling of the arbitrary timeline imposed on our client by the USA() \nin order to allow time for your office to consider our request that you undertake a review of this \ncase. \nThank you for your time and attention. \nRespectfully submitted, \n, Q-1444 \nKenneth W.
