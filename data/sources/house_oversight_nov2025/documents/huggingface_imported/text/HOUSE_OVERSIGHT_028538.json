  "text": "prosecution will occur in this matter as long as Epstein continues to uphold his agreement\nwith the State of Florida. ... Case agent is requested to contact writer in the event this matter\nmoves forward on a federal level.”\n\nThe memo was one of hundreds of documents, including dozens of copies of newspaper\narticles about Epstein, that were posted on the FBI’s website. The website,\nwww.vault.fbi.gov, serves as the FBI’s electronic FOIA library. The heavily redacted\ndocuments showed agents traveled to New York City, Sante Fe, N.M., and St. Thomas in the\nU.S. Virgin Islands, where Epstein has homes. But there is little information about who they\ninterviewed or what they learned.\n\nThe only witness named in the documents is Alfredo Rodriguez, who was a houseman at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach mansion in 2004. That’s when Epstein regularly paid young women to\ngive him sexually-charged massages, police said.\n\nRodriguez was convicted of obstruction of justice in 2010 and sentenced to 18 months in jail\nfor trying to sell a journal he purloined from Epstein. Prosecutors said the journal detailed\nEpstein’s sexual dalliances. Rodriguez, who lived in Kendall, died in 2014.\n\nThose familiar with FBI procedures said the records are administrative files, not\ninvestigative ones. Some questioned why the files were posted on the FBI’s web site. The\nFBI didn’t return a phone call for comment. According to the web site, the records were\nreleased “in compliance with the National Archives and Records Administration\nrequirements.”\n\nAnd while it’s been 10 years since Epstein pleaded guilty to prostitution charges and settled\ndozens of lawsuits with young women, litigation continues.\n\nScott J.
