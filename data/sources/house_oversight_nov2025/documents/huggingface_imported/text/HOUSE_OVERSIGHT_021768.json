  "text": "on this attorney Jack Goldberger, Harvard Law School Professor Alan Dershowitz,\n\nwho defended O.J. Simpson against murder charges, and Kenneth Starr, the\n\nprosecutor who pursued then-President Bill Clinton for lying about sex with\n\nyoung women.\n\nPalm Beach police spent 11 months investigating Epstein before State Attorney Barry\nKrischer sent the case to a grand jury, instead of charging Epstein so the man who once\nboasted of accepting only billionaire clients could face a trial. The police had taken a high\nschool transcript, class schedules and phone messages from Epstein's home that showed.\nhe knew the girls were underage. Yet Mr. Krischer was more swayed by Epstein's\nlawyers, who attempted to impugn the girls’ character by showing they had chatted on\nmyspace.com about smoking marijuana and drinking. He should have let a jury decide\nwhether the victims - and Epstein - were credible.\n\nUltimately, one charge against Epstein finally reflected the age of one victim, and the\nplea agreement left Epstein labeled a sex offender. With that additional charge, if Epstein\nhad been convicted at a trial, he could have been sentenced to anything from probation to\n15 years in prison, Assistant State Attorney Lanna Belohlavek said, adding that the\nrecommended guideline sentence was 21 months.\n\nEpstein also won't have to certify to the court that he is receiving counseling, typically\nrequired of sex offenders, because he has a private psychiatrist. But without court\nsupervision, who will ensure Epstein is in fact being treated?\n\nThe plea deal also drops a federal investigation of Epstein. If a federal investigation was\nwarranted, how does dropping it before completion benefit the public?\n\nEpstein preyed on girls and denied it. For three years, his wealth and the influence of his\nlawyers bought him the protection the state attorney owed to the victims.\n\nNew York Post — 07/27/2008\n\nNew York Post - New York, N.Y.\n\nDate: Jul 27, 2006\n\nStart Page: 014\n\nSection: Page Six\n\nText Word Count: 395\n\nIT looks like New York billionaire financier Jeffrey Epstein got off easy when he was hit\nwith a charge of soliciting a prostitute for a \"happy ending\" in Palm Beach.\n\nBecause if Palm Beach police had their way, Epstein, 53 - who surrendered last Sunday\nand is out on $3,000 bail - might have been whacked with far more serious charges of\npaying underage girls for sex.\n\nBut a state grand jury found the witnesses in the case were not credible and threw out all\nbut the single charge of soliciting a hooker in his luxurious Palm Beach home. Epstein's\nlawyers and friends now say he's the hapless victim of a vendetta by Palm Beach Police\nChief Michael Reiter, whom they describe as a \"born-again nut case.\"\n\nAccording to the police investigation, a copy of which was obtained by the Palm Beach\nPost, detectives took statements from 17 witnesses and five alleged victims. Haley\nRobson, 20, a Palm Beach Community College student who described herself as \"like a\n\nHeidi Fleiss,\" says she got naked to give Epstein a massage, then brought him six girls\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021768",
