  "text": "We estimate that it is in 3yly, 2y2y and 2y1ly that the selloff would be largest (75-85bp\n— see Table 5) were the OIS curve to align with the median dots up to end of 2019.\n\nOptions are attractive to position for a selloff in those forwards for two main reasons:\n\n1. Volatilities in ly and 2y tails appear to trade cheap on our macro model. More\nspecifically, accounting for the relationship between implied vols and the first\nthree principal components of the swap curve, we find that 2y1y implied vol\nshould be trading 22bp normal higher (Chart 52), and 2y2y vol should be 19bp\nhigher. A simpler historical regression of 2y1ly vol vs the 2y1ly forward rate also\nsuggests normal vol should be around 21bp higher (Chart 53).\n\n2. Payer skews could richen in 2yly and 2y2y. While they are looking rich across\n6M+ expiries in ly and 2y tails (based on payer-ladder breakevens/ATM vol), we\nnote that this has been the case for some time now and it’s rather in gamma on\n5y+ tails that skews now appear richest on a 6m z-score basis. Relative to what\nhas been realized in the past month, the payer skew appears just fair in 2y1y,\nwhile it is rich across tails in longer expiries.\n\nChart 52: Market vs fitted level of 2y1y vol, based on macro model (*) Chart 53: 2y1y implied vol is 21bp too low on a regression vs 2y1y fwd\n120 140\n100 120\n80 100\n60 80\n60 y = 35.017x + 28.016\n40 R? = 0.8667\n96 —— 2y1y market implied vol 40\nm= 2y'y fitted\n0 20\nTUCNNANANMYMMYMMTH TTTONOMWNMMOWOO oO 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3\n&8 3 ES &8 2 3 ae 2 5 & 8 s = &8 3 3 g = past by ¢ — since July m= last Linear (past 6y)\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

Table 3 below\nconfirms that the 2y1y point is attractive relative to other forwards (2\" best), with a net\npayout ratio of 1.9 (2.9:1 gross) after three months. The best payer on that metric is the\n3m5y 25-delta OTM payer (strike of 2.05%}, which we recommend as an alternative for\nthose confident that the repricing of the OIS curve to the dots will take place by Feb-17.\n\nTable 3: Payoff ratios when buying a 25-delta OTM payer, under the selloff scenario where forwards converge to the levels implied by the median Fed dots(*)\n\nTrade Smty 3m2y 3m5y Sm10y 6miy 6m2y 6md5y 6m10y_ tyty Ty2y ty5y 1y10y 2yty 2y2y 2y5y 2y10y dsyty Sy2y Sy5y = 3y10y\nStrike (25-delta), % 1.31 1.54 2.05 2.44 1.49 1.73 2.23 2.60 1.84 2.08 2.51 2.84 2.50 2.65 2.95 3.21 2.98 3.08 3.28 3.47\nATM forward, % 1.14 1.34 1.77 2.13 1.24 1.43 1.83 2.17 1.44 1.62 1.96 2.25 1.81 1.92 2.17 2.38 2.04 2.12 2.32 2.47\nPremium, bp of yield 4.1 4.9 6.9 7A 65 75 9.6 10.0 10.4 eS 13.4 14.1 17.0 18.5 19.2 19.6 23.8 24.2 23.8 23.8\n3mroll, bp of yield -4.1 -49 -6.9 -74 -5.1 -5.4 -5.9 -5.4 -5.0 -5.0 -4.3 -4.2 -44 -43 -3.3 -2.8 -3.5 -3.2 -2.6 -2.2\n\n3m selloff to the dots fA 31 3] 48 18 30 54 45 30 58 65 45 5 80 65 45 85 74 if 45\n\nReturn, bp of yield -4.1 -44 16.5 5.4 -0.6 3.8 16.0 10.7 Ce) 21.3 24.8 13.2 32.6 35.1 26.4 16.3 39.6 335 24.2 18.3\nNet payout ratio -1.00 -0.89 0.73 -0.10 0.51 1.66 1.08 0.90 1.85 1.85 0.94 1.37 0.83 1.66 1.39 1.01 0.77\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.
