This steady and sustained market growth\ncreates a positive macro environment for investment in the sector.\n\ne Significant Opportunity Created By Healthcare Reform & Restructuring: Through at\nleast the next decade, the healthcare industry will be going through a period of\nsignificant restructuring as government, private insurance companies, and employers\nimplement broad reform initiatives that seek to slow the growth of healthcare spending\nand limit the threat this burden creates to their long term fiscal viability. In the U.S., the\nfederal government laid the foundation for these changes with two key pieces of\nlegislation: the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (“ACA”) and the Health\nInformation Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act (HITECH Act”), which are\ndesigned to reduce costs, improve quality, and significantly expand the percentage of\nthe population with access to healthcare services. Importantly, a component of the\nlegislation sets aside funding in the form of direct incentives to healthcare providers to\nbe used to purchase technologies needed to meet the legislation’s requirements. As part\nof healthcare reform, government and private payers will need to migrate their\ntraditional fee-for-service reimbursement models towards more value-centered\napproaches that reward outcomes, efficiency, and reduction in waste. Payers are\napproaching this goal by slashing costs in areas where viable lower cost solutions are\navailable, while at the same time investing much more in the adoption of innovative\nnew products and solutions which can improve outcomes and deliver quantifiable\nvalue, even when considering their additional costs and premium pricing. During this\nperiod of substantial change in the healthcare system, the Fund Managers expect to see\nan unusually large number of opportunities to fund companies developing innovative\nand impactful new therapeutic products as well as tools and applications that enable the\nimplementation and realization of healthcare reform’s goals and objectives.\n\ne Rapid Acceleration in Innovation: The Fund Managers believe an unprecedented\nperiod of medical innovation is emerging as decades of research into molecular\nmechanisms of disease is being translated into a steady stream of safer and more\neffective medicines and the biomarkers to guide their use. Importantly, these products\nare providing enormous improvements in both life expectancy and quality of life for\npatients with many serious, life-threatening diseases. Although they will come with\npremium pricing, these products can decrease the overall costs to the healthcare system\nby reducing reliance on equally costly, but less effective and more toxic treatments, by\n\n® CMS, OECD, Eurostat\n\n4 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024015",
