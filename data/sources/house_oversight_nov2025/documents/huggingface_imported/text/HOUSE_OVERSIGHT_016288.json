  "text": "systematically thought through everything that could possibly go wrong when putting\nastronauts on top of a 110-meter rocket full of highly flammable fuel and launching them\nto a place where nobody could help them—and there were lots of things that could go\nwrong. Was this scaremongering? No, this was the safety engineering that ensured the\nmission’s success. Similarly, we should analyze what could go wrong with AI to ensure\nthat it goes right.\n\nOutlook\n\nIn summary, if our technology outpaces the wisdom with which we manage it, it can lead\nto our extinction. It’s already caused the extinction of from 20 to 50 percent of all\nspecies on Earth, by some estimates,”° and it would be ironic if we’re next in line. It\nwould also be pathetic, given that the opportunities offered by AGI are literally\nastronomical, potentially enabling life to flourish for billions of years not only on Earth\nbut also throughout much of our cosmos.\n\nInstead of squandering this opportunity through unscientific risk denial and poor\nplanning, let’s be ambitious! Homo sapiens is inspiringly ambitious, as reflected in\nWilliam Ernest Henley’s famous lines from /nvictus: “I am the master of my fate, / Iam\nthe captain of my soul.” Rather than drifting like a rudderless ship toward our own\nobsolescence, let’s take on and overcome the technical and societal challenges standing\nbetween us and a good high-tech future. What about the existential challenges related to\nmorality, goals, and meaning? There’s no meaning encoded in the laws of physics, so\ninstead of passively waiting for our Universe to give meaning to us, let’s acknowledge\nand celebrate that it’s we conscious beings who give meaning to our Universe. Let’s\ncreate our own meaning, based on something more profound than having jobs. AGI can\nenable us to finally become the masters of our own destiny. Let’s make that destiny a\ntruly inspiring one!\n\n°° See Elizabeth Kolbert, The Sixth Extinction: An Unnatural History (New York: Henry Holt, 2014).\n\n68\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016288",
