The only way to do that is to be intensely aggressive,\nmaking moderation strategically difficult.\n\nIsrael responded modestly compared to the past after the Eilat\nincident, mounting only limited attacks on Gaza against mostly\nmembers of the Palestinian Resistance Committees, an umbrella\ngroup known to have links with Hamas. Nevertheless, Hamas has\nmade clear that its de facto truce with Israel was no longer assured.\nThe issue now is what Hamas is prepared to do and whether Hamas\nsupporters, Saudi Arabia in particular, can force them to control anti-\nIsraeli activities in the region. The Saudis want al Assad to fall, and\nthey do not want a radical regime in Egypt. Above all, they do not\nwant Iran's hand strengthened. But it is never clear how much\ninfluence the Saudis or Egyptians have over Hamas. For Hamas, this\nis emerging as the perfect moment, and it is hard to believe that even\nthe Saudis can restrain them. As for the Israelis, what will happen\ndepends on what others decide - which is the fundamental strategic\nproblem that Israel has.\n\nDr. Friedman is the Chief Executive Officer and founder of\nSTRATFOR.
