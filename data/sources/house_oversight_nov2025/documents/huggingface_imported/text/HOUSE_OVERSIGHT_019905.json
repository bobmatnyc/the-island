More recently, he had helped bail\nout his friend’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner.\n\nHe watched with amusement Trump’s eccentric presidential campaign and brokered the\ndeal to have Paul Manafort replace Corey Lewandowski after Lewandowski fell out of\nfavor with Kushner. Then, as confounded as everyone else by the campaign’s continuing\nsuccesses, Barrack introduced the future president in warm and personal terms at the\nRepublican National Convention in July (at odds with its otherwise dark and belligerent\ntone).\n\nIt was Trump’s perfect fantasy that his friend Tom—an organizational whiz fully aware\nof his friend’s lack of interest in day-to-day management—would sign on to run the White\nHouse. This was Trump’s instant and convenient solution to the unforeseen circumstance\nof suddenly being president: to do it with his business mentor, confidant, investor, and\nfriend, someone whom acquaintances of the two men describe as “being one of the best\nDonald handlers.” In the Trump circle this was called the “two amigos” plan. (Epstein,\nwho remained close to Barrack, had been whitewashed out of the Trump biography.)\n\nBarrack, among the few people whose abilities Trump, a reflexive naysayer, didn’t\nquestion, could, in Trump’s hopeful view, really get things running smoothly and let\nTrump be Trump. It was, on Trump’s part, an uncharacteristic piece of self-awareness:\nDonald Trump might not know what he didn’t know, but he knew Tom Barrack knew.

But\nBarrack, even after countless pleading and cajoling phone calls from Trump, finally had to\ndisappoint his friend, telling him “I’m just too rich.” He would never be able to untangle\nhis holdings and interests—including big investments in the Middle East—in a way that\nwould satisfy ethics watchdogs. Trump was unconcerned or in denial about his own\nbusiness conflicts, but Barrack saw nothing but hassle and cost for himself. Also, Barrack,\non his fourth marriage, had no appetite for having his colorful personal life—often, over\nthe years, conducted with Trump—become a public focus.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nTrump’s fallback was his son-in-law. On the campaign, after months of turmoil and\noutlandishness (if not to Trump, to most others, including his family), Kushner had\nstepped in and become his effective body man, hovering nearby, speaking only when\nspoken to, but then always offering a calming and flattering view. Corey Lewandowski\ncalled Jared the butler. Trump had come to believe that his son-in-law, in part because he\nseemed to understand how to stay out of his way, was uniquely sagacious.\n\nIn defiance of law and tone, and everybody’s disbelieving looks, the president seemed\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019905",
