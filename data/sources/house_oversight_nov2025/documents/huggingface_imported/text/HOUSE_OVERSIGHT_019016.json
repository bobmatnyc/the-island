I was instructed\nby Case Agent Det. Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media\nrelated material from the residence.\n\nUpon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as\nthe Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the\nleft side cover removed, exposing the CPU s hardware sitting on floor\nnext to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or\nfeatures indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with\nthe power cord not plugged in. The keyboard and mouse were atop the\nCPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,\nprinter, or other media device. On the back Panel of the CPU, I\nobserved an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware\nwould allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPU s hard disk.\n\nThe ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search\nand no external camera was located within this room.\n\nThe CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel\nLCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative\nof a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It\nappeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the\ncables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same\narea. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,\ni.e. CDs, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is\ncommonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media\nwas found.\n\nAfter completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned\nall items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis\nvia a property receipt.\n\nI was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden\nRoom, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a\nflat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and\nprinter; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed\nfrom an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk\narea revealed no signs of any media devices.\n\nDet. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana\nroom, which is detached from the residence and located just south of\nthe pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office\ntype setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,\nkeyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the\ncables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A\nsearch of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019016",
