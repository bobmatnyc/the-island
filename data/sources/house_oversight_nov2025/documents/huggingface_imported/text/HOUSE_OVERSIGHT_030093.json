  "text": "34\n\nIn Aleppo, a jewel among cities, with its commanding citadel and\nlabyrinthine, covered souk, she sees fully veiled ladies, exotic\nbedouin women displaying bright spots of color, and wealthy Gulf\nArabs wearing white robes rubbing shoulders with men riding\ndonkeys and mixing with “trophy girlfriends” in miniskirts teetering\nperilously on the ultra-high-heeled shoes that Aleppans evidently\nconsider to be the height of fashion.\n\nHaving been in Aleppo recently, I can vouch for the accuracy of her\ndescriptions. Visiting several mosques, churches, and shrines, she\nprovides impressive testimony of the country’s religious diversity and\nthe regime’s commitment to religious freedom. It would be tragic if\nthe pursuit of democracy led to the shredding of this bright human\ncanopy, where religious and cultural differences seem to have\nflourished under the iron grip of a minority sectarian regime.\n—Rome, May 11, 2011\n\nMalise Ruthven is the author of Islam: A Very Short Introduction,\nIslam in the World: The Divine Supermarket (a study of Christian\nfundamentalism), A Fury for God: The Islamist Attack on America,\nand A Satanic Affair: Salman Rushdie and the Wrath of Islam.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030093",
