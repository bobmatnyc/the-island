  "text": "116 6 A Brief Overview of CogPrime\n\n6.7 Conclusion\n\nTo thoroughly describe a comprehensive, integrative AGI architecture in a brief chapter would\nbe an impossible task; all we have attempted here is a brief overview, to be elaborated on in\nthe 800-odd pages of Part 2 of this book. We do not expect this brief summary to be enough to\nconvince the skeptical reader that the approach described here has a reasonable odds of success\nat achieving its stated goals, or even of fulfilling the conceptual notions outlined in the preceding\nchapters. However, we hope to have given the reader at least a rough idea of what sort of AGI\ndesign we are advocating, and why and in what sense we believe it can lead to advanced artificial\ngeneral intelligence. For more details on the structure, dynamics and underlying concepts of\nCogPrime, the reader is encouraged to proceed to Part 2- after completing Part 1, of course.\nPlease be patient — building a thinking machine is a big topic, and we have a lot to say about\nit!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013032",
