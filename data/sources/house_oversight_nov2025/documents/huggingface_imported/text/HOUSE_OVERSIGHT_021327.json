  "text": "movements increase activity within the\nmotor system measured using fMRI.\nFurthermore, it is possible to show that\nthe same parts of the motor system can\nbe active in talking and in understanding\nspeech. By analyzing which parts of the\nbrain are active and when they become\nactive, it is possible to show that when\nmotor system activity in the frontal lobe\nof the brain precedes activity in other\nregions (e.g., the temporal lobe),\nlisteners have a better understanding.° It\nis as if the motor system “recognizes”\nthe speech before other parts of the brain\nwhen the talking mouth is visible to the\nlistener.\n\nThis study shows that more\ninformation about the action of\nproducing speech (visible mouth\nmovements) can activate the motor areas\nof the brain during understanding of\nspeech. But it is also the case that\nunderstanding speech without seeing the\nspeaker depends on the motor system.\nHockey players are experts at hitting\nslap shots, blocking passes, and\nwhacking each other in the head with\nhockey sticks. They have done these\nthings in the real world just as monkeys\nin Parma have learned to reach for\ncertain objects. When hockey players\nlisten to sentences describing hockey\naction, even without seeing the speaker\nor the action, motor areas are active\nduring sentence understanding and these\nsame motor areas are not active in\npeople without hockey experience.’\nUnderstanding described actions appears\nto be influenced by the motor systems of\npeople who have experience with those\nactions. Understanding action may be\ninfluenced by the experiences of our\nmotor systems.\n\nReading minds through action\n\nPage |81\n\nIn understanding other people,\nwe Start with what we understand about\nourselves. As Nick Epley describes in\nhis chapter, we take this kind of\negocentric perspective in understanding\nother people or pets or God or the\nbehavior of inanimate objects. We know\nwhat we meant when we say something\nor do something and we make the same\nattribution to others, even nonhuman\nothers. While this may be a good starting\npoint for religions to help people feel\nconnected to God, as discussed by Clark\nGilpin, it may not be uniformly\ninformative about human behavior.\nBehavior is not transparent for the\nintention of that behavior. The fact that\nany particular action is not necessarily\nunique to the intent behind it is the basis\nof a great deal of misunderstanding in\ndaily interactions. As a result, even if\nmirror neurons help our brains recognize\nactions and sometimes interpret them,\nthere are real limits to how experience-\nproducing actions can correctly inform\nsocial understanding.\n\nIn spite of this limitation, we\nmay often do just this—assume we\nunderstand another’s actions because of\nwhat we would intend were we to do the\nsame thing in the same circumstance.\nHuman social understanding does suffer\negocentric limitations often and to the\nextent that it does, something like a\nmirror neuron system may play a role.\nFor example, as discussed by Jean\nDecety in his chapter, our ability to\nunderstand the pain of others may derive\nin part from the neural systems involved\nin our experience of pain, but goes\nbeyond this starting point. The social\nbrain is on one level perhaps a very\negocentric brain. But the fundamental\nmotivation to connect with others has\nresulted in systems built on top of these\negocentric foundations.
