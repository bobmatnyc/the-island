  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nimprisoned.” Several years later I was being interviewed on a television show and the host asked\nme what my biggest fee had been. He thought I would mention the Michael Milken or Leona\nHelmsley cases, but instead I said it was in the Sharansky case. He expressed surprise saying that\nhe didn’t know Sharansky had any money. I said he did not but that when he put his arms around\nme and gave me that hug and whispered those words, that was the biggest fee I ever earned.\n\nAnother “fee” for my work was the opportunity to speak in Carnegie Hall on behalf of Vaclav\nHavel and other dissident artists in 1991. Several Americans who had fought for the human rights\nof censored artists were invited to read from and discuss works banned by repressive regimes. I\nhad been part of a team of lawyers assembled to help Havel and other Czeck dissidents get out of\nprison in the 1970s. The American readers included Garrison Keillor, Marvin Hamlisch, Peter\nUstinov, William Warfield, Martin Garbus, and Maurice Sendak. I was honored to be included\namong them. My mother loved showing her friends the Carnegie Hall program, with my name\nlisted as a “performer.” She would tell them a variation of the old joke: A man asks a musician\ncarrying a violin case, “How do you get to Carnegie Hall? My mother’s answer: “Practice,\npractice, practice law, like my son.”\n\nMy next encounter with Havel took place in Jerusalem during the celebration of Israel’s 60\nbirthday. Havel, Sharansky and I were on a panel together discussing human rights. When it was\nover we got onto the same elevator. Remarkably, Mickael Gorbachev was also on the elevator.\n(I knew it sounds like the beginning of a bad joke: “Havel, Sharansky, Gorbachev and\nDershowitz get into an elevator.”) Gorbachev turned to me and said, “You’re the big shot lawyer\nwho tried to get these people out of prison. You did a good job, but I did a better job. I’m the\none who got them out.” We all laughed and Havel turned to Gorbachev and asked, “Why didn’t\nyou get us out sooner?” Gorbachev replied, “I’m not that good.”\n\nThe struggle against real Apartheid\n\nMy interest in South Africa Apartheid began while I was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal\nin 1961. An article was submitted on the legal structure of the apartheid system in the country.\nAt that time very little was known about the legal aspects of this highly regulated practice, and\nthis lengthy draft laid it all out. It was my job to edit it so as to make it comprehensible to an\nAmerican audience. It was shocking to me that only a few decades after the Nuremburg Laws in\nNazi Germany, a “civilized” country, with a British and Dutch heritage, could construct a system\nof laws based on overt racism and discrimination, under which racial classifications determined\nwho could vote, hold certain jobs, live in certain areas, be treated in good hospitals, attend public\nevents, enroll in schools and hold office. I was determined to help dismantle the system of\napartheid and actively joined in the campaign against it. But there were limits to what I was\nprepared to do, and these limits brought me into conflict with some of the most ardent anti-\napartheid activists. Most particularly, I was not willing to support the “blacklisting” or artists\n\n326\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017413",
