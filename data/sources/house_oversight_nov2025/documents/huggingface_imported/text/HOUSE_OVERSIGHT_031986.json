QO. SCOTT\n\n“Inside Job,” a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime\nwithout punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The\nbetrayal of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and\ndamaging than the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than\nvillain.\n\nThe gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous\nas it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject\nmatter make “Inside Job” feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has summoned\nthe scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint and good\nhumor makes his case all the more devastating.\n\nHe is hardly alone in making it. Numerous journalists have published books and articles retracing the\npaths that led the world economy to the precipice two years ago. The deregulation of the financial\nservices industry in the 1980s and ’90s; the growing popularity of complex and risky derivatives; the\nreal estate bubble and the explosion of subprime lending -— none of these developments were exactly\nsecret. On the contrary, they were celebrated as vindications of the power and wisdom of markets.\nAccordingly, Mr. Ferguson recycles choice moments of triumphalism, courtesy of Lawrence H. Summers,\nGeorge W. Bush, Alan Greenspan and various cable television ranters and squawkers.\n\nEven as stock indexes soared and profits swelled, there were always at least a few investors, economists\nand government officials who warned that the frenzied speculation was leading to the abyss. Some of these\nprophets without honor show up in front of Mr. Ferguson’s camera, less to gloat than to present, once\nagain, the analyses that were dismissed and ignored by their peers for so long.\n\nDozens of interviews -— along with news clips and arresting aerial shots of New York, Iceland and other\ndisaster areas — are folded into a clear and absorbing history, narrated by Matt Damon. The music (an\nopening song, “Big Time,” by Peter Gabriel, and a score by Alex Heffes) and the clean wide-screen\ncinematography provide an aesthetic polish that is welcome for its own sake and also important to the\nmovie’s themes. The handsomely lighted and appointed interiors convey a sense of the rarefied, privileged\nworlds in which the wall Street operators and their political enablers flourished, and the elegance of\nthe presentation also subliminally bolsters the film’s authority. This is not a piece of ragged\nmuckraking or breathless advocacy. It rests its outrage on reason, research and careful argument.\n\nThe same was true of Mr. Ferguson’s previous documentary, “No End in Sight,” which focused on\ncatastrophic policies carried out in Iraq by President George W. Bush’s administration just after the\noverthrow of Saddam Hussein. But whereas that film concentrated on a narrow view of a complex subject —\nthe conduct of the war rather than the at least equally controversial rationale for fighting it - “Inside\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031986",
