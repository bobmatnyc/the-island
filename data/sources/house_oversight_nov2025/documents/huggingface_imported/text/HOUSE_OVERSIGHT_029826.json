The past WTO agreements are\nvaluable for all 158 WTO members. But\nsome economies want to go further by\nreducing barriers in important sectors\nsuch as the services trade, environmental\ngoods and services, government\nprocurement, and the digital economy.\n\nThe services trade, for example, 1s vital\nfor boosting innovation, productivity and\njobs in developing and developed\ncountries alike—but regulatory,\nlicensing, zoning and other barriers to\nservices are often equivalent to a 30%\ntariff or higher. Because liberalization in\nthe WTO has been stuck, countries have\nturned increasingly to bilateral and\nmultilateral free-trade agreements, some\nof which have addressed these newer\ntopics. The U.S. should foster the WTO\nprinciple of world-wide liberalization by\nadopting standards in various industries\nand sectors that would be open to all\neconomies that reciprocate. The WTO\nalso needs new rules for fair trading by\nstate-owned enterprises.\n\nYet the U.S. also should use free-trade\nagreements to open markets.
