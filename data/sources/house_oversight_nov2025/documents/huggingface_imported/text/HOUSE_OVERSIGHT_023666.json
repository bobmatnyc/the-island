Usually\nthe NPC is seen as sort of a\nchoreographed event: we\nknow what to expect. But\nthis time it felt very different.\nRLK: It certainly was\ndifferent. You have to look at\nthis year’s National People’s\n1\nCongress - and the so-called\nTwo Sessions - as part of the\n“political season” which\nbegins with the party\ncongress in October and goes\nnow to the government\nsessions in March. And\nnormally there is a\npredictability and what\nhappens at the National\nPeople’s Congress is not very\nsignificant.\nRLK: This year is different:\nChina talks about a “New\nEra” – and this is not just\nwords, it is really the case. If\nwe look at the vision that Xi\nJinping gave at the party\ncongress, what we see here\nat the National People’s\nCongress we see as the\nimplementation of that vision\nacross a very broad front.\n2\nRLK: People have focused on\nterm limits - understandably\nso - but the change is only for\nthe presidency. Xi Jinping by\nhaving been made “Core” of\nthe Party in October 2016 -\nactually with that designation\nundermined “collective\nleadership” - and when Xi’s\nname was put into the Party\nConstitution as the\ncontemporary arbiter of\nMarxism - on which the Party\nis based and the Party rules\nthe country - he then became\nthe overarching leader, no\nmatter what position he\nwould hold.\n3\nCNN International\nPresident Xi Jinping, China, Term Limits\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn – March 12, 2018\nHOST: Let’s talk about President Xi Jinping with our\ngues,t Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a longtime advisor to the\nChinese government, the author of How China’s Leaders\nThink, and the host of Closer to China with R.L. Kuhn on the\nChina Global Television Network. Thanks for being with\nus.\nRLK: Hi Natalie. Interesting day we’re having.\nHOST: Isn’t it, though? So, I guess the first question\nwould be to follow up on your book title, how China’s\nleaders think. What is Xi Jinping thinking with this move?\n\nRLK: First of all, we have to understand it in context.\nThere are twenty-one different clauses in this\nConstitutional Amendment, and the whole point of it is to\nstrengthen the governance system of China. Now China is a\nparty-state system where the party controls the state.\nEveryone is focusing on the abolition of term limits, and it\nis important, but we need to understand the context within\nthis party-state system. In October of 2016, Xi Jinping was\nmade “Core” of the Party, which meant the collective\nleadership of the past was no longer operative; that X was,\nin essence, for the Party, the decision maker. Then just this\nlast October at the 19th CPC National Congress, his name\nwas put into the Party Constitution as “Xi Jinping Thought\non Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New\nEra,”… it’s a big phrase.\nRLK: But what it means is that Xi is the arbiter of Marxism\nand party theory. That means in terms of being the Core ot\nthe Party and the interpreter of Marxism that gives him\nultimate power. He doesn’t even need a formal position when\nhas those two and the Party continues to run the country.\nHOST: Is that a good thing? How can it be a good thing for\nthe country when one person has the ultimate power?\nRLK: There are two issues. One is how it happened: Now\nthe abolition of presidential term limits coordinates with the\nParty and military, together the three largest positions. So\nthey’re now coordinated because he already had that power\nin the Party and the military.\n2\nAmanpour on CNN\nPresident Xi Jinping, China, Term Limits\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn – Minxin Pei\nMarch 5, 2018\nHOST: When it comes to trade, one country more\nthan any other has been the target of Trump’s\nrhetorical wrath, and that’s China. But my next\nguest tells me that the promised tariffs won’t\nbother China much, as we’ve been discussing. In\nany way, they in China are dealing with much more\nimportant things, like the proposal for the rubber\nstamp Party Congress which starts its new session\ntoday to change the Constitution, and lift all term\nlimits on President Xi Jinping, effectively making\nhim president for life. Now, I’ve been talking to\nMinxin Pei: he’s a professor of government at\nClaremont McKenna College in California, and to\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn, who is the author of How\nChina’s Leaders Think, and he is the host of a show\non the government-run CCTV news channel in\nBeijing. Gentlemen welcome to you both. Let me\nstart by asking you, Robert Lawrence Kuhn there in\nBeijing. From the Chinese government perspective,\nthese tariffs that the president of the United States\nhas announced, how much does it concern Beijing?\n\nRLK: Well certainly it’s a concern, but I would call it a\nminor annoyance as opposed to something extremely\nserious. They have a lot on their plate here. The last\nthing they want is a trade war with the U.S., but they\nhave to react. If the U.S. does something, there has to be\nsomething that they will do in retaliation. They will\nratchet it down. They will signal, as you do, that they do\nnot want to accelerate this, but to save face and to be\nappropriate, they’ll have to match it.\nHOST: To you Minxin Pei, how do you see this playing\nout?\nMP: If the investigations find China at fault, or guilty of\nsome practices, then the US has a wide range of options\nto punish China on a trade front. And if these things\nhappen, then US-China trade war will take place.\nAnother thing I want to say is that US-China relations\nhave turned a corner. This is a relationship that has\nheaded toward a long period of confrontation, and\nadversarial relationships. So what is going to happen\non the trade front is part of a much larger picture of\ngeopolitical rivalry, if not competition.\n2\nBloomberg TV Worldwide\nPresident Xi, China, Economy\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn – March 5, 2018\nHOST: You were there at the Great Hall of the People. What was\nyour main takeaway from what some have described as Li\nKeqiang’s impossible challenge: how to deleverage, how to take\naway stimulus, and still keep 6.5% growth?\nRLK: I don’t take the 6.5% growth as the primary objective here.\nI mean you have to look at what these National Peoples\nCongresses are. They’re not setting the vision and the strategy.\nThat was set at the party congress in October. What we’re dealing\nhere is the implementation of the policies. If you attend these\nevery year you know they all look and sound the same because\nit’s the same structure, same kind of structure of numbers, so\nwhat you do is look for the differences. What are those subtle\ndifferences between one year and another. That’s what I focus on\nat these congresses.\nHOST: What’s the main difference you saw?\n1\nBBC World News\nXi Jinping and the New Politburo Standing Committee\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\nOctober 25, 2017\nHOST: We’re going to put a question to Robert Lawrence\nKuhn, who’s a long-time advisor to the Chinese\ngovernment. Robert, great to see you again. You were\nwith us at the very beginning of the Party Congress and\nyou were at the Congress today when it finished. Did you\nhave any vision, any inkling that President Xi Jinping\nwould take on so much authority? Also, what about the\nfact that there is no successor candidates among the new\nleaders?\nRLK: I was interviewed in early 2012 by a well-known\nAmerican television network and the question put to me,\nin January of that year, was, “isn’t Xi Jinping going to be a\nvery weak leader because he was not appointed by Deng\nXiaoping and he has no strong base of support?”\n1\nCNN International\nXi Jinping and the New Politburo Standing Committee\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn - October 26, 2017\nHOST: The author of How China’s Leaders Think: The Inside\nStory of Past, Current and Future Leaders, Robert Lawrence\nKuhn is a longtime advisor to the Chinese government. He\ncomes to us once again from Beijing. We talked this time\nyesterday. Good to have you back. And we discussed\nyesterday what we would learn about that lineup of the\nstanding committee. It hadn’t been revealed at that point\nthat we spoke, but we now know and is it correct to say the\nmost significant thing is no sign of a leader in waiting?\nRLK: I think the most significant sign is who the people are\nand how they relate to each other. It’s a group that actually\nrespects traditional norms.\nRLK: There was thought that Wang Qishan, for example,\nmight violate norms by being on the Standing Committee\nafter the traditional retirement age and that’s not the case.\nThere is balance among the member in terms of their\ngeographies, even their political affiliations within the party\nwhich internally are important. Two are from Shanghai,\ntwo are from the Communist Youth League - one is actually\nfrom Shanghai and the Youth League as well but he’s really\nfrom Shanghai - two have a long relationship with General\nSecretary Xi. And then of course General Secretary Xi has\nthe overarching power as everyone says - and that is correct\nand will be correct for a long time to come.\n\n\nCHINA DAILY Tuesday, January 23, 2018\nVISION CHINA\n7\nObservers offer fresh insight for new era\nIntellectual hails progress\nmade in past while warning\nof challenges that lie ahead\nBy LI YANG\nliyang@chinadaily.com.cn\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn has many\ntitles, ranging from investment\nbanker to anatomy researcher. But\nhe is better known in China as a specialist\nwho knows the country\ninside out.\nOver the past 29 years, he has\nvisited almost every provincial\nregion and spoken with people from\nall walks of life, including some who\nhave gone on to become State leaders.\n“It’s been a great gift to my life to\nbe able to learn so much about China’s\nrich civilization, political theories\nand the whole development,” he\nsaid.\nKuhn, who is from the United\nStates, learns as an outsider but\ncommunicates as an insider. In his\ntalk show Closer to China with R.L.\nKuhn on the China Global Television\nNetwork, he presents China’s\ncomplex story to the world through\ncandid, intimate discussions with\nthe country’s decision-makers.\nIn a hotel suite in Wangfujing,\ndowntown Beijing, one busy lunchtime\nlast week, Kuhn shared his\nthoughts on Chinese politics with\nChina Daily, between exercising and\na meeting of the Communist Party\nof China, which he had been invited\nto attend as an observer.\nHe spoke passionately about the\n19th CPC National Congress, which\nwas held in Beijing in October,\ndescribing it as “a milestone congress\nthat set the agenda for more\nthan 30 years”.\nThe Party proposed two new concepts\nat the congress — “a new era\nof socialism with Chinese characteristics”\nand Xi Jinping Thought\non Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\nfor a New Era, which has\nbeen written into the Party Constitution.\n“To understand China today, it is\ncritical to appreciate what the new\nera means. … I like to understand\nnew era in two categories: its characteristics\nat home and abroad, and\nits timeline,” Kuhn said.\nHe has obviously developed his\nown way of explaining terms with\nChinese characteristics. That is to\nbreak down the characteristics,\ndomestically and internationally,\nrather than delve into the term.\nHe listed a number of challenges\nin China’s new era, from pollution to\nmedical care, among which he said\nthe biggest is the rising expectations\nof the people at home, because “now\nthat the people have some, they\nwant more”.\nThe complex international environment\nis the main characteristic\nof the new era, as the world is fragmented\nby diverse problems and\nchallenges, he said.\nWhile explaining what he called\nthe timeline of the new era (2017,\n2021, 2049) and expounding his\nunderstanding of Xi Jinping\nThought on Socialism with Chinese\nCharacteristics for a New Era —\nwhich he broke down into three categories:\nserve the people, national\nrejuvenation, and governance modernization\n— Kuhn showcased his\nknowledge of the Party’s files, which\nhe has clearly learned by heart.\nHe recited almost every key\npoint of the 68-page report Xi\ndelivered to the congress in October.\nMore important, he made connections\nbetween these points,\npresenting them in a vivid way, seasoned\nwith personal experiences\nand thinking.\nWhen asked about the effects of\nthe anti-corruption campaign, he\nimmediately listed 10 objectives.\nThat’s his style of approaching Chinese\nissues — divergent thinking\nand a vigilance not to lose sight of\nthe connections between different\npoints.\nBritish journalist tells China’s story to the world\nBy LIU XUAN\nliuxuan@chinadaily.com.cn\nBroadcaster sees choice and confidence in rising nation\nBy YANG WANGLI\nyangwangli@chinadaily.com.cn\nFor 20 years, Liu Xin has had a singular\ngoal: to build a bridge of understanding\nbetween China and the\noutside world.\nThe television presenter began\nworking for China Central TV, the\nState broadcaster, in 1997, two years\nafter becoming the first Chinese to\ntake part in — and win — the International\nPublic Speaking Competition.\nEarly last year, her desire to share\nChina’s story received a major boost\nwhen she was chosen to host The\nPoint, a prime-time discussion show\nthat airs weekdays on the China Global\nTelevision Network.\nShe said that China entering a new\nera means three things: opportunities,\nchallenges and responsibilities.\n“My winning speech in that 1995\nnational competition was about\nchoice,” she said. “After 15 years of\nreform and opening-up, we Chinese\nnow enjoy an abundance of choice in\nour daily lives.”\nAfter listening to General Secretary\nXi Jinping’s report at the opening of\nI like to understand\nnew era in two categories:\nits characteristics\nat home and abroad,\nand its timeline.”\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn, investment\nbanker and anatomy researcher\nQ&A | ROBERT\nLAWRENCE KUHN\nYou hold multiple titles now.\nHow have you managed to\nmaster so many different\nfields? Do they have anything\nin common?\nThere’s one word to describe\nthe commonality, that is “passion”.\nWhatever I’ve done I\nwant to have passion for it. To\nexpand that a bit, it’s the passion\nto learn. I’m not here to\nteach, I love to learn. When I\nwrite a new book, it’s something\nI want to learn about. I\nuse that vehicle to learn. So\npassion about learning is the\ncommon denominator. China\nhas given me a hugely rich life\nbecause of everything I’ve\nlearned here.\nthe 19th National Congress of the\nCommunist Party of China, Liu said\nshe was impressed with his use of the\nword “confidence”.\n“It’s the confidence China has developed\nthrough knowing that our system\nworks. The confidence about who\nwe are as a people, as a culture. And it’s\nthe confidence about our future role in\nthe world,” she said.\n“As media workers, we believe we\nhave a great story to tell. In the past,\npeople relied on a few correspondents\nor experts for information and opinions\non China. But more people are\ntuning in to Chinese media for information,\nboth traditional platforms\nsuch as TV and online.”\nAs more questions emerge in the\nminds of those watching from outside\nChina, Liu said the opportunities to\ntell stories from inside the country are\ngrowing. However, so too are the challenges.\n“Because of the ideological differences\nbetween China and the West, China\nhas always been the subject of\nWestern media criticism, which is\noften downright bashing based on\nfalsehoods,” she said.\nFrom left: Zhao Jianguo, head of the international communication bureau of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee; Jiang\nQingzhe, Party chief of the University of International Business and Economics; China Daily reporter Andrew Moody; Guo Weimin, vice-minister of the Information\nOffice of the State Council; speakers Robert Lawrence Kuhn and Liu Xin; Zhou Shuchun, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily; and Zhang Jianmin, head of\ntranslation and interpretation for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pose for a photo at the inaugural Vision China event on Monday at UIBE. FENG YONGBIN / CHINA DAILY\nNow that China has defied all kinds\nof predictions of a collapse or economic\nhard landing, Western observers are\nhaving a hard time explaining the China\nphenomenon, she said, adding that\nthe result is an ignorance-based superiority\ncomplex mixed with bewilderment\nand iced with jealousy.\nDuring her 30-minute program, Liu\nconducts live interviews with guests in\nthe studio or via satellite link to get a\nChinese perspective on two to three topics\nthat affect people around the world.\n“I understand the urgency to be\nmore assertive, but I believe we always\nneed to be aware of the danger of putting\nfeelings before reason, putting\nopinions before facts,” she said.\n“Nationalism is my biggest enemy.\n“President Xi has said we need to\nimprove the quality and effect of development.\nI believe this also applies to\nChina’s international communication.\nThe Chinese people will work hard\ntoward a community of a shared future,\nregardless of how others view us.”\nMeanwhile, Liu has a job to do. “As a\njournalist, our duty is to tell China’s\nstory as it is, one topic at a time, one\nshow at a time,” she added.\nThe real fun of\nreporting in China is\nthe closeness to the\nactual story, the big\nfascinating story of\nChina merging into\nthe 21st century.”\nAndrew Moody,\nChina Daily senior reporter\nChina has always been\nthe subject of Western\nmedia criticism,\nwhich is often\ndownright bashing\nbased on falsehoods.”\nLiu Xin, host of The Point on\nChina Global Television Network\nQ&A\nANDREW MOODY\nHow do you overcome the\nchallenges of showing the\nreal China to the world,\nespecially to those who have\nbiases against China?\nIt’s a long-term thing, and\nyou cannot change this overnight.\nThere are negative perceptions\nabout China. It’s\nabout engagement. If China\nhas much more interactions\nwith the rest of the world, then\npeople will see China as it\nactually is. One of the 2035\nobjectives is to better increase\nChina’s soft power. Organizations\nlike China Daily can actually\nplay a role in improving\nChina’s soft power. But I do\nthink it’s a long-term process,\nand China doesn’t need to be\ntoo sensitive toward criticism.\nDespite living and working in China\nfor a decade, Andrew Moody’s ability\nto speak Mandarin is still at a basic\nlevel. Yet that has not stopped the\naward-winning journalist from interpreting\nChina’s story for the world.\nMoody joined China Daily nine\nyears ago and is now a senior correspondent.\nHe has written more than\n150 cover stories for the paper’s European\nWeekly and African Weekly,\nexamining a wide range of issues\nincluding the Belt and Road Initiative.\nThe job has provided him with firsthand\nexperience of how China is\ndeveloping as well as the chance to\nrecord reactions from the outside\nworld, especially in the West, toward\nthe nation’s growth and changes.\nHe was at the Great Hall of the\nPeople to hear General Secretary\nXi Jinping deliver a report to the\n19th National Congress of the Communist\nParty of China in October,\nwhen the concept of a “new era” was\nfirst mentioned.\n“The consensus of the various people\nI spoke to in the hours after the\nspeech was that China’s entering a new\nera could be a momentous turning\npoint in world history,” Moody said.\nAccording to his interviews, he\nsaid, people believe that a more confident\nChina is striding into a world\nthat it also is helping to shape.\nMoody has his own understanding\nof the new era. With 40 years of\nreform and opening-up, he said China\nhas reached a point where it can move\non in many ways, such as in foreign\npolicy, global governance and domestic\nreforms. “China has reached a new\njunction and has to move forward.”\nThe British journalist has written\nmany stories that explain China to the\nrest of the world, and these have\nbrought him many honors, including\nbeing named a State High-End\nProject Foreign Expert.\n“I like reporting on China because\nit’s perhaps the 21st century’s most\nfascinating story,” he said. “The real\nfun of reporting in China is the closeness\nto the actual story, the big fascinating\nstory of China merging into\nthe 21st century, the stories that maybe\nWestern media don’t really have\nthe chance to interview.”\nMoody sees his task as communicating\nChina to a global audience, and\nthere are still a number of things that\nneed to be done, he said.\n“I go back to the UK quite a lot, and\nI still don’t think that people are\naware of the impact of a much bigger\nChinese economy and China’s being a\nmore significant player in the world,”\nhe said. “All I can do is to report and do\nstories one by one.”\nQ&A | LIU XIN\nAs a professional journalist,\nwhat do you think China’s\nmainstream media could do\nto better report China to the\noutside world in such a media\ntransformation age?\nIt’s challenging. I think we\nneed to be aware of new technology.\nAnd the content is very\nimportant. If we’re more confident,\nwe can really be more\nsincere, be more at ease with\nour problems and our achievements.\nSo let’s have a sincere\nconversation, not shy away\nfrom the problems we’re facing.\nThat’s why I say let’s tell\nthe China story as it is. It’s not\n100 percent about achievements.\nEvery day we see mixed\nnews, we have mixed feelings,\nso let’s be factual, let’s be sincere\nand let people decide\nwhether they want to watch us\nor not. This is going to take\ntime, but I think if we follow\nthe right philosophy, the right\nsteps, we’re going to make it.\nWhat they say\nVision China\nis the\nfirst highend\nevent\norganized\nby China\nDaily and\nUIBE after the two sides\nlaunched a partnership.

The\ninternational media, no surprise,\nfocus on the constitutional\namendment ending term limits,\nassuming President Xi Jinping will\nnow serve in a for-life dictatorship,\nreminiscent of Mao’s China,\nthe Soviet Union, the Kim family\nin North Korea and some African\ncountries.\nIt is no challenge to explain\nwhy abolishing term limits is bad\nfor China – dependency on one\nhuman being who is not omniscient\nbut is hostage to fortune,\nfewer and weaker checks and\nbalances, forced conformity in a\ncomplex society with no easy answers,\netc. The system begins\nstronger in that hard choices can\nbe made and consistency maintained,\nbut it could become brittle\nin that officials are more wary and\nmay say things they do not\nbelieve.\nIt is a challenge to explain why\nabolishing term limits is good for\nChina, so that’s what I will do.\nFirst, some background. There\nare three separate issues being\nconflated: the significance of ending\nterm limits, the intended consequences\nand the unintended\nconsequences. Though terminating\nthe two-term limit for China’s\npresidency captures headlines, it\nis more the symbolic, final step\nratifying Xi’s near-absolute power\nthan the big breakthrough itself.\nMany expect this\nexperiment to\nend badly for\nChina. It is\nindeed an\nexperiment but\nits end is not set\nXi’s prior designation as “core” of\nthe Communist Party in October\n2016 and the inscribing of “Xi\nJinping Thought...” into the party\nconstitution in October 2017 were\nmore meaningful.\nMoreover, the Politburo\nStanding Committee, the highest\nauthoritative body in China,\nunambiguously supports Xi.\nChina watchers see the front page\nof People’s Daily – published the\nday after the new Standing Committee\nmarched out on stage –\nwhich featured Xi’s photo on top,\nmany times larger than the smaller,\nsubservient photo of all seven\nmembers lined up on the bottom.\nAll this reconfirms that, in a\nsystem where the party controls\nthe state – especially where the\nparty is Marxist and ideology is its\nbasis for being – Xi, as core of the\nparty, with his name inscribed in\nthe constitutions of party and\nstate as the contemporary arbiter\nof Marxism, will be the uncontested,\noverarching leader of China\nfor the rest of his sentient life.\nFor intended consequences,\nthe official line is that the purpose\nis national cohesion brought\nabout when the three top leadership\npositions – general secretary\nof the party, chairman of the Central\nMilitary Commission and\npresident of the republic – are\naligned temporally and held by a\nsingle person.\nThis makes sense, but as a\nprimary, proximal motivation, it is\nnot entirely persuasive. The\ncurrent structure has existed for\ndecades without outcry or angst\n(not to mention that the three positions\ncould be unified by installing\nterm limits on the other two).\nThe “new era”, marked by economic,\nsocial and global complexities,\nis said to require firm\nand consistent leadership, making\nmoot inner party struggles\nand even mitigating political gossip,\nfacilitating focus on the tasks\nof governance and development.\nSpecifically, because advancing\nreform has become more difficult,\nwith entrenched interest groups\nresisting change, the message\nmust now go forth that all must\nget with the programme, because\nyou can’t outwit or outwait Xi.\nBecause, it is said that only Xi\nhas the vision, experience, competence\nand character to bring\nabout “the great rejuvenation of\nthe Chinese people”, especially\nfrom 2020 to 2035 and ultimately\nto 2050 – bringing China to global\ncentre stage – Xi’s unimpeded\nleadership is deemed essential.\nChina cannot afford “downtime”\nto accommodate a change of\nleadership, and after Xi’s success\nat the 19th National Party Congress\ncame the time to make clear\nthat he will call the shots for the\nforeseeable future.\nSome argue that doing away\nwith term limits shows the superiority\nof the Chinese system as it\nallows flexibility in matching\nleadership to requirements\n(though what national leader,\nwhen extending his reach, has not\nclaimed “current requirements”\nas justification?).\nThe party-run Global Times\nstated that ending term limits\ndoes not mean China has reverted\nto president-for-life tenure. (But\nwho can deny that however long\nXi holds the top positions seems\nlargely up to him?)\nAs for the unintended consequences,\nthe almost unanimous,\ndisparaging foreign reaction –\nother than US President Donald\nTrump’s – did not burnish China’s\ninternational image.\nMore worrisome would be a\nreluctance by officials to offer\nconstructive opposing views on\ncentral policies.\nBy stressing term limits, the\ninternational media misses\nfundamental changes going on in\nChina – this year, innovation,\nstreamlining of government, facilitation\nof business (cutting\nbureaucracy and reducing taxes),\nrural revitalisation and rural land\nreform. The 13th National People’s\nCongress shows how the\ngrand vision and mission of the\n19th National Party Congress is\ntranslated into specific strategies\nand policies. If one sees only term\nlimits, one cannot visualise the big\npicture.\nAs for Xi maintaining the presidency\nperpetually, it doesn’t actually\nmatter much – this is the deep\ninsight of how China’s party-state\nsystem works. Xi as core of the\nparty and “Xi Jinping Thought...”\nas the party’s (and now the state’s)\nguiding principle means that Xi\ncan transfer titular party leadership\nand/or the presidency to others\nand still maintain his\noverarching power. It may well be\nthat, after serving two or even\nthree more terms, rather than trying\nto find and install another\nleader like himself, he will move to\nbring about true democracy within\nthe party.\nHere’s the best case. Xi will not\nbe leader-for-life, but leader long\nenough to bring about China’s\nnational rejuvenation and establish\na Chinese kind of democratic\nnorms. Could Xi continue until\naround 2035, when China plans to\nhave “basically” achieved full modernisation,\nheading towards, by\nmid-century, 2050, a “great modern\nsocialist country”?\nMany expect this experiment\nto end badly for China. It is indeed\nan experiment but its end is not\nset. It may be a race between\nachieving Xi’s grand vision and\nsome untoward perturbation that\ncould cause fracture.\nAll factors considered, I am not\nsaying abolishing term limits is\nabsolutely good for China. I am\nsaying it may be good – because of\nChina’s special conditions and\nXi’s special capabilities – but if it is\ngood, it’s just for this once, and it’s\njust for so long. That’s the best\ncase. I’m rooting for Xi.\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn is a public\nintellectual, international corporate\nstrategist and investment banker, and\nChina expert/commentator. He is the\nauthor of How China’s Leaders Think\nPrivate clubs\ndeserve ‘cushy’\nrental deals\nEdith Terry says private recreational\nclubs are part of Hong Kong’s\nheritage and have contributed to\nnurturing less popular sports, as\nwell as a unique hybrid culture\nIn 1964, a young German, fresh off the plane at his\nfirst job, went in search of a social group. He found a\nhome away from home in Hong Kong’s oldest\nprivate recreational club, newly relocated from a prime\nlocation on Victoria Harbour, where City Hall is today,\nto a modest flagstone boathouse beneath Island Road\non Hong Kong’s south side. Fifty-five years later, Frank\nPfeiffer, a Zen Buddhist and mountain climber, is still\nan active member of the Victoria Recreation Club,\nestablished in 1849. He has watched it ring the changes\nfrom Hong Kong’s colonial society in the 1960s, when it\nhad only two Chinese members and no female\nmembers, to the hybrid institution it is today, under its\nfirst Hong Kong Chinese chairman, Wu Kam Shing.\nIts membership is a spectrum of Hong Kong’s\ndiverse and athletically minded middle class. There is\nthe Hong Kong Chinese court reporter who visits the\nclub in Deep Water Bay every morning at 6am on her\nway from home in Ap Lei Chau to her workplace in Sha\nTin. There are her fellow swimmers, many elderly, who\nswim out to the buoys, rain or shine, hot or cold, every\nday. Some 100-150 “paddlers” use the club as a base for\noutrigger canoeing, dragon boating and paddle\nboarding. Some of the sports were unknown to Hong\nKong before the club nurtured them, others, like\ndragon boating, are deeply traditional.\nIn the current debate over the future of the 67\nprivate recreational clubs that pay minimal rents to the\ngovernment, history has been swept aside. True, they\nwere designed on a colonial template, in which the\ndiverse ethnic groups were given separate retreats.\nMembership at the pinnacle clubs was reserved\nprimarily for the British. For other ethnic groups, there\nwas a Chinese Recreation Club, a Club de Recreio, a\nFilipino Club, an Indian Recreation Club, and so on.\nHong Kong’s colonial rulers reviewed the lease\nsystem for the private clubs in 1968 and 1979, and in\nthe run-up to the handover in 1997 when leases were\nrestricted to 15-year terms. At the handover, a number\nof leases were extended to ensure a so-called smooth\ntransition. The sceptic would argue that this was a\ndodge, and indeed, in 2011, during the first post-1997\nreview of private recreational leases by the Legislative\nCouncil, most of the clubs seemed oblivious to public\nconcerns as well as new requirements for “opening up”\nThe government argued\nthat subsidies were\nneeded because use of land\nfor sports and recreation\nwould never trump\ncommercial utilisation\nWhat the Western belt and road sceptics are missing\nWenshan Jia says there are opportunities for the whole world to benefit from China’s initiative\nChina’s “Belt and Road Initiative”is\nan original plan to carry out a new\ntype of “collaborative globalisation”\nabove and beyond US-led type. It was\nproposed five years ago by President Xi\nJinping after the tapering off of US-led\nglobalisation in 2008.\nXi offered three principles: mutual\nconsultation, joint construction and\nshared benefits. China has since then fully\nexecuted 101 agreements with 86\ncountries, and total investment in the 24\ncountries along the belt and road regions\nhas amounted to US$50 billion, resulting\nin 75 industrial and trade zones, and\n200,000 jobs.\nWith its focus on infrastructure, the\ninitiative is a model not only for developing\ncountries, but also industrialised ones in\nEurope and North America, where ageing\ninfrastructure needs replacing. It also\nadapts to each local, national or regional\ncondition, situation and need. It is proving\nvery democratic, more so than the\nlopsided US-led globalisation that spurred\na populist, isolationist backlash across the\nWestern world.\nChina has done a proper job of\nexplaining to the West what the initiative is\nand extended a sincere invitation to each\ncountry to join. Many think tank scholars\nand major media outlets in the West have\nfound it potentially lucrative and\nexpressed relatively strong support.\nYet, instead of appreciating China’s\nefforts to both inherit the liberal agenda of\nglobalisation and forge a new path for\nglobal development, many Western\npolitical elite, led by the US, have started a\ncampaign to resist the initiative. From\nAustralia to the US , and the UK to\nGermany, there are calls for the West to cut\ninteractions with China to minimise or\nresist its so-called “sharp power”. The\nlabels typically applied to China include\n“authoritarian” and “predatory”, citing\nBeijing for not upholding “freedom,\ndemocracy and individual rights”, the core\nvalues of the West.\nThis attitude towards the initiative\nreveals not only a contradiction in the\nWestern mind, but also the narrowing or\neven closing of minds.\nIsn’t it beneficial to meet the goals of\nforging connectivity and cooperation, as\narticulated in Xi’s effort to enrich and\nexpand the meaning of the “free world” by\nliberating humankind from geographical,\nfinancial, political and cultural barriers?\nThe world is no longer the West versus the\nrest, as we already live in a world\nconnected by the internet. The initiative\nseeks to make the world more\ninterconnected for both the West and the\nrest, contributing to the construction of a\nhuman community with a shared future.\nRecently, the initiative has inspired and\nspawned a push for localisation,\nparticularly the Indo-Pacific strategy led by\nthe so-called “Quad” of the US, India,\nJapan and Australia. Some Western media\nview it as a rival or alternative to China’s\nbelt and road.\nBut I would argue that it can be part of\nChina’s initiative as long as the three\nChinese principles (mutual consultation,\nThe anti-China smear\ncampaign must be\nreplaced by a\ndiscourse involving\nconsultation and\ncommunication\njoint construction and shared benefits) are\nobserved in the Quad strategy. The belt\nand road was created to be an all-inclusive\nplatform, so Beijing has no need to fear\nlocalisation as long as such strategies do\nnot seek to contain China or disrupt its\nplan. It would be wise for the Quad and\nChina to look for ways to collaborate.\nQuad countries need not take an\nantagonistic stance towards China; the\nanti-China smear campaign must be\nreplaced by a discourse involving\nconsultation and communication. The\nworld has experienced more than enough\ndamaging talk, not to mention wars.\nThe core principles of Xi’s belt and road\nstrategy must be always applied in China’s\ninteractions with local strategies. If China\nis, as German Foreign Minister Sigmar\nGabriel told the Munich Security\nConference in February, “the only country\nin the world with any sort of genuinely\nglobal, geostrategic concept”, then\nWestern leaders should cultivate a\ngenuinely global strategy in line with\nChina’s vision, for the betterment of all\nhumankind.\nWenshan Jia, PhD, is a professor in the\nSchool of Communication, at Chapman\nUniversity (California) and a research fellow\nat the National Academy of Development\nand Strategy, Renmin University of China\nto schools and community organisations. Following\nthe last well-publicised review in 2013 and the current\ninvestigation seeking new venues for public housing,\nthey are no longer complacent.\nShould the private clubs have got their cushy rental\ndeals in the first place? At the time of the reviews 50\nyears ago, the government argued that subsidies were\nneeded because use of land for sports and recreation\nwould never trump commercial utilisation. What was\ntrue then is even more so today. The high cost of land in\nHong Kong is a drag on innovation and creativity. The\nexistence of the private recreational clubs means it has\nbeen less of a drag on sports.\nMost of the clubs with government leases are\nframed around core sports – golf, tennis, horse racing,\nswimming, sailing and rowing, to name a few. Hong\nKong athletes whose development was supported by\nthese clubs have gone to the Olympics and other\ninternational competitions. In the 1940s, the Victoria\nRecreation Club was the driving force behind Hong\nKong’s participation in the International Olympic\nCommittee and the Hong Kong Sports Federation.\nPublic pressure on the clubs to forge community\nties and contribute to Hong Kong through “opening\nup” schemes is appropriate – but not the pressure to\nconvert their land to high-rise estates. The loss is not\nonly to the core sports they represent but also to their\nunique DNA, which is the foundation of Hong Kong –\ndiverse, cosmopolitan and adventurous. If you want to\nlook for a Hong Kong that is not just about money, one\nplace to look is here.\nEdith Terry is the honorary secretary of the Victoria\nRecreation Club.

I’ve\nseen it all this year, and attended or even\nparticipated in the major events. I’ve conversed\nwith Chinese leaders and experts,\nand searched for meaning.\nI didn’t appreciate the opportunity I’ve\nhad until I began reviewing the year from\nChina’s domestic perspective, seeking\nthemes and trends, discerning from what\nwe know about the recent past to what we\nmight forecast about the near-term future.\nIt takes no flash of insight to see the leadership\nand vision of President Xi Jinping\nheadlining almost every event.\nFollowing is the review of the meaningful\nevents of 2017.\nJanuary: Xi began\nthe year with a memorable\nspeech at the\nWorld Economic Forum\nin Davos, Switzerland,\nmounting a roaring\ndefense of globalization,\nfree trade, and\nRobert Lawrence\nKuhn\neconomic openness and\nliberalization. It was the\nfirst-ever speech by China’s\nhead of state at\nDavos and, as commentators the world over\nnoted with amazement and irony, as the\nUnited States under President Donald\nTrump was apparently retreating from the\nworld and abrogating global leadership,\nChina under President Xi was apparently\ndefending the international order and promoting\nglobal governance.\nMarch: The annual “two sessions” of the\nNational People’s Congress, China’s top legislature,\nand the Chinese People’s Political\nConsultative Conference National Committee,\nthe top political advisory body, seemed\nto radiate more energy than usual, perhaps\nin anticipation of the 19th National Congress\nof the Communist Party of China in\nthe fall. A highlight was the adoption of the\ndraft general provisions of civil law, a step\ncloser to a long-needed unified civil code.\nI sensed delegates’ growing confidence\nand assertiveness to represent their particular\nsectors in the competitive marketplace\nof public ideas and government funding, a\ncompetition that is vital for the development\nof China’s kind of consultative democracy.\nThis was especially true of the CPPCC\nNational Committee, whose members are\noften leading experts in their fields, such\nthat even though they do not have legal\nauthority to pass laws, they have moral\nauthority to exert pressure and affect\nchange. It did not escape notice that,\nthroughout the “two sessions”, Xi was recognized\nrepeatedly as “core” of the CPC Central\nCommittee and of the whole Party.\nBelt and Road to the fore\nMay: The first “Belt and Road Summit”\n(the Belt and Road Forum for International\nCooperation), held in Beijing, was the diplomatic\nhighlight of the year in China. Some\n130 countries participated, including 29\nheads of state and government. The goal\nwas no less than the transformation of the\neconomic structure of the developing\nworld: building infrastructure and connectivity,\nstimulating development, alleviating\npoverty, reducing severe imbalances, promoting\nSouth-South cooperation, and revitalizing\nglobalization.\nXi called the Belt and Road Initiative “the\nproject of the century”.\nJuly: China celebrated the 20th anniversary\nof Hong Kong’s return to the motherland.\nIt was a time of reflection for the\ncosmopolitan city, long a global leader in\neconomic freedom and competitiveness.\nHong Kong had flourished: its way of life\npreserved, its economy dynamic. But times\nchange. With Shanghai and Shenzhen on\nthe rise, and with some claiming the “one\ncountry, two systems” principle is in\ndecline, Hong Kong faces new challenges.\nAugust: The People’s Liberation Army\ncelebrated its 90th anniversary. In a move\nboth practical and symbolic, the PLA established\nits first overseas logistics base in Djibouti,\nsituated strategically on the Horn of\nAfrica.\nXi Jinping, who is also chairman of the\nCentral Military Commission, said the PLA\nis becoming “strong” informationized\narmed forces. “The Chinese people love\npeace,” Xi said. “We will never seek aggression\nor expansion, but … No one should\nexpect us to swallow the bitter fruit that is\nharmful to our sovereignty, security or\ndevelopment interests”.\nForeigners are wondering: what is the\nPLA’s long-term plan for operating overseas?\nWhat will be the impact of the PLA’s\nmodernization and reform, especially its\nburgeoning blue-water navy with multiple\naircraft carriers?\nAugust: China hosted the BRICS Summit\nin Xiamen, East China’s Fujian province.\nThe five BRICS countries — Brazil,\nRussia, India, China and South Africa —\nhave increasing influence on global economy\nand politics, but does BRICS as an organization\nmake sense? China certainly thinks\nso, and promoted the BRICS Summit as\nrepresenting a new kind of multilateral\nglobal governance. There are complexities:\npolitical instabilities in Brazil and South\nAfrica; the growing, comprehensive cooperation\nbetween Russia and China; the sensitive,\nmultifaceted relationship\nbetween India and China.\nThroughout the year, events on the\nKorean Peninsula continued to\nintrude. While China continued to\ncall for denuclearization and dialogue,\njust hours before Xi gave\nthe opening speech at the BRICS\nSummit, the Democratic People’s\nRepublic of Korea detonated its\nmost powerful nuclear bomb\never.\n19th Party Congress\nand the New Era\nOctober: The highlight of the\nyear was, as expected, the 19th\nCPC National Congress. Not quite\nexpected were the far-reaching\nproclamations and, taken together,\nthe magnitude of their significance. I\nwitnessed history and see six highlights.\nFirst, Xi’s name and thought were written\ninto the CPC Constitution — “Xi Jinping\nThought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics\nfor a New Era”. Xi is now, officially,\nthe overarching creator and arbiter of political\nthought, and combined with his designation\nas “core” of the CPC, he is now the\nundisputed, unimpeded leader with singular\nauthority. Xi Jinping “thought” is built\non the twin pillars of people orientation and\nnational rejuvenation, with the new concept\nof development (innovation, coordination,\ngreen, open, sharing) driving a new\nkind of economic growth.\nSecond, the “New Era”, which is intended\nas a policy-energizing game changer, is a\nconceptual lens with which to view the\nrange of goals, strategies and concepts that\ncompose Xi’s way of thinking and the Party’s\nnew direction.\nThe “New Era” is envisioned in three temporal\nsegments: (i) from now until the fulfillment\nof China’s first centenary goal of a\n“moderately prosperous society” in 2020\n(2021 being the 100th anniversary of the\nCPC); (ii) from 2020 to 2035, when the CPC\nstates it will build on the foundation of the\nmoderately prosperous society so that, after\n“15 years of hard work”, the country will\n“basically” realize “socialist modernization”;\nand (iii) from 2035 to 2050, when the CPC\nstates it will “work hard for a further 15\nyears” and “develop China into a country\nthat is prosperous, strong, democratic, culturally\nadvanced, harmonious, and beautiful”.\nRealizing this vision at mid-century,\naround 2050, with China being respected as\na great, modern, socialist country, is the second\ncentenary goal (2049 being the 100th\nanniversary of the People’s Republic of China).\nThird, the new “principal contradiction”\nin China’s “New Era” is between “unbalanced\nand inadequate development” and\n“the people’s ever-growing needs for a better\nlife”, which includes increasingly broad\ndemands for “democracy, rule of law, fairness\nand justice, security, and a better environment”.\nFrom now on, this new-era\nprincipal contradiction, replacing quantitative\nGDP growth with qualitative improvement\nof life, is what will guide China’s\ndomestic affairs and policies.\nFourth, the Party’s leadership role in governing\nthe country is expanding and the\nParty’s stringent approach to governing\nitself is intensifying. The Party will be more\ndeeply embedded within agencies of government\nand sectors of society (including\nprivate companies, foreign businesses and\neducational institutions), and by reforming\nand purifying itself, the Party’s governance\nwill be stricter and more comprehensive.\nThe anti-corruption campaign, not only\ncontinues, it has been enhanced.\nFifth, the “New Era” has China moving\ncloser to center stage of the world and making\ngreater contributions to humanity,\noffering “Chinese wisdom” and “Chinese\nsolutions” for world problems. China’s\ndiplomacy will be proactive, championing\nthe development of a community with a\nshared future for humanity and encouraging\nthe evolution of the global governance\nsystem.\nSixth, I watched the new senior leaders of\nChina, the seven members of the new\nStanding Committee of the Political Bureau\nof the CPC Central Committee, walk out on\nstage, ending months, really years, of speculation\nand rumor. Because everything in\nChina reports to a Political Bureau Standing\nCommittee member, and because of the\nParty’s principle of collective leadership,\ntheir personalities, composition and balance\ndetermine the vision, strategies and\npolicies that shape China.\nThe importance of the Political Bureau\nStanding Committee remains true today,\nbut its importance frankly is also less true\ntoday. It is hard to overstate the consequences\nof Xi’s name written into the Party\nConstitution, thus inscribing into perpetuity\nhis predominant status and assuring\nhis continuing pre-eminence in the coun-\ntry’s political life.\nFollowing the 19th Party Congress, some\nmight have expected a respite, a slower\nNovember and December. They were anything\nbut.\nForm is substance\nNovember: The “state visit-plus” of US\nPresident Donald Trump came at a delicate\nmoment. Amid pomp and pageantry,\nincluding a personal tour of the Palace\nMuseum (Forbidden City), $253 billion in\nbusiness deals were signed, a world record,\nthough critics complained it was all transactional,\nnothing structural. The number,\nsome said, was more form than substance,\nbut here, perhaps, form was substance.\nBoth Xi and Trump hailed the visit as “successful\nand historic”.\nYet, on sensitive topics, one could be forgiven\nfor seeing sunlight between their\npositions. On trade, Xi lauded the business\ndeals and market access, “which will deliver\ngreat benefits for the two peoples”. Trump\nsought improved trade with China based on\n“a level playing field for our workers” and\nsolving the “massive trade distortion” —\nwhich, characteristically, Trump blamed on\npast US administrations, not on China.\nOn the Democratic People’s Republic of\nKorea, Xi reiterated China’s firm commitment\nfor a denuclearized Korean Peninsula\nand direct communications, while Trump\nsaid that they “agreed not to replicate failed\napproaches of the past” and he called for\n“increased economic pressure until North\nKorea abandons its reckless and dangerous\npath”.\nSubsequent to Trump’s visit, China\nannounced revised regulations that were\nindeed structural. China will reduce or\neliminate (over time) limits on foreign\nownership of financial services sectors,\nincluding insurance, commercial banking,\nsecurities, futures, and asset management.\nSignificantly, the State Council, China’s\nCabinet, established a Financial Stability\nand Development Committee to oversee\nfinancial stability and boost risk prevention\n(including close monitoring of “shadow\nbanking” and corporate debt). This new\nsupra-ministry commission will be empowered\nto make decisions related to reform\nand development, coordinate issues concerning\nmonetary policy, and establish\nfinancial policies and related fiscal and\nindustrial policies, thus improving the\nfinancial regulatory system.\nAt the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation\nLeaders’ Meeting in Vietnam, Xi strengthened\nhis themes of making economic globalization\nmore open, balanced and\ninclusive; lauded regional multilateralism\nfor promoting common interests; and\nstressed the Belt and Road Initiative for\nadvancing global connectivity.\nWhat struck me in Xi’s speech was what\nhe inserted about poverty: “To lift all the\nremaining poor people out of poverty is a\nsolemn commitment made by the Chinese\ngovernment to the people. It is uppermost\nin my mind, and I have spent more energy\non poverty alleviation than on anything\nelse.”\n“Upper most in my mind?” “More energy\non poverty alleviation than on anything\nelse?” An extraordinary statement from the\npresident! Although Xi has been making\nhigh-profile visits to numerous poor counties\nand villages, relentlessly championing\n“targeted poverty alleviation” for realizing\nthe “moderately prosperous society”, this\nwas his clearest statement that poverty alleviation\nis his highest priority.\nMain contradiction reinforced\nTwo unpleasant events in Beijing reinforced\nthe new “principal contradiction”,\nhighlighting “the people’s ever-growing\nneeds for a better life” as that surprisingly\npowerful lens for viewing Chinese society.\nThe first was alleged child abuse at a kindergarten.\nThe second was a fire in which\n19 migrant workers died. In both cases, netizens\nreacted with anger: in the alleged\nchild abuse, anger about a perceived coverup;\nin the fire, anger for the disorderly and\ninconsiderate way of evacuating migrant\nworkers.\nWhen Xi first announced the new principal\ncontradiction at the 19th Party Congress,\nsome dismissed it as arcane Partyspeak.\nPublic reaction to the alleged child\nabuse and to the fire revealed its prescient\nand perspicacious wisdom.\nThe second volume of Xi Jinping: The\nGovernance of China, a collection of 99 of\nXi’s speeches, conversations, instructions\nand letters, was published. The book offers\na resource to follow the development of Xi’s\nways of thinking and ideas and to understand\nChina’s new guiding philosophy and\nthe specific elements that compose it.\nThe month ended with what may seem a\nlight touch when Xi called for China to\nupgrade its toilets. Toilets among the year’s\nhighlights? Xi was serious and his point is\nprobative. For China to become a more civilized\nsociety, the hygiene of the people must\nbe improved (especially in rural areas), and\nfor China’s tourism industry to blossom,\nbetter bathrooms are needed. Although\nChina’s leader talking toilets elicits smiles,\nand some say it downgrades his dignity, it\ndemonstrates, above all, Xi’s intrinsic commitment\nto improve the quality of life for\nthe Chinese people.\nDecember: In the first nine days of the\nmonth, Xi engaged with four international\nevents, stressing common commitment to\nbuild a community of a shared future for all\nhumanity.\nThe four engagements\nSHI YU / CHINA DAILY\nTo the “CPC in Dialogue with World Political\nParties High-Level Meeting”, Xi\ndescribed four views of the future: a world\nthat is safe and free of fear; prosperous and\nfree of poverty; open, inclusive and free of\nisolation; and environmentally clean and\nbeautiful.\nAt the “Fourth World Internet Conference”,\nXi asserted how the internet posed\nnew challenges for sovereignty, security and\ndevelopment.\nAt the “2017 Fortune Global Forum”, Xi\ncalled for openness and innovation to\nenhance global economic growth, pledging\nto liberalize and facilitate trade and foreign\ninvestment in China.\nAnd at the “South-South Human Rights\nForum”, Xi emphasized that “human rights\nmust and can only be promoted in light of\nspecific national conditions and people’s\nneeds”.\nThe CPC’s Dialogue with World Political\nParties was path-setting in that it put the\nworld on notice that a transformed CPC\nunder Xi is reaching out globally with pride\nand confidence — explaining, especially to\ndeveloping countries, the developmental\nbenefits of party leadership and party building.\nThe point of debate, as it were, has\nshifted from whether the China model of a\nperpetually ruling party (with all that\nentails) is good for China to how the China\nmodel is good for other countries.\nAt a meeting of the Political Bureau of the\nCPC Central Committee, Xi directed authorities\nto improve digital infrastructure, promote\nthe integration and sharing of digital\nresources, and protect data security, in\norder to better serve the nation’s economic\nand social development as well as to\nimprove people’s lives. The big vision is to\nturn China into a world leader in big data\nand a global innovation hub for artificial\nintelligence by 2030.\nThe last major event of the year was the\nannual Central Economic Work Conference,\nwhich identified “three tough battles” for\nthe next three years: preventing and defusing\nrisks (especially financial risks), eliminating\nabsolute poverty (China’s 2020 goal),\nand curbing pollution (for instance, encouraging\ninvestment in environmental projects).\nSetting three-year targets was itself\nan innovation (over the traditional one-year\ntargets), thereby strengthening long-term\nthinking, reducing pressures to make hasty\ndecisions, and giving markets stable expectations.\nThe priority of reducing absolute debt\nwas modified to controlling a rise in borrowing,\nsuch that China’s debt-to-GDP ratio\ndoes not further deteriorate. This signaled\nthat growth would not be jeopardized and\n(to the disappointment of some) debt-driven\ngrowth would continue.\nTo contain financial risk, China will\ncrackdown on irregular and illegal activities\nin its chaotic financial industry and intensify\nregulatory scrutiny; continue supply-side\nstructural reform (reducing overcapacities);\nand maintain a proactive fiscal policy, a\nprudent and neutral monetary policy, and a\nbasically stable yuan exchange rate.\nResisting arguments for shrinking Stateowned\nenterprises, China will make SOEs\n“stronger, better and bigger”; and the government\nwill seek efficiencies by becoming\nmore of an investor and less of an operator.\nChina pledged to open up its markets further\nand to balance trade by boosting\nimports (US pressures, expressed vividly by\nTrump, were not mentioned).\nTheoretical foundation\nAfter five years of “practice”, the theoretical\nfoundation of China’s economic development\nis now labeled, “Xi Jinping\nThought on Socialist Economy with Chinese\nCharacteristics for a New Era”, paralleling\nthe phrase added to the Party\nConstitution two months earlier. The\n“thought” is based mainly on Xi’s new concept\nof development — innovative, coordinated,\ngreen, open and shared development\n— which has been the core of his economic\nphilosophy.\nFor the first time at this annual conference,\ntopics other than economics were on\nthe agenda. Diverse public concerns were\naddressed, such as burdensome homework\nfor schoolchildren, sex discrimination in\nthe workplace, and online scams. This was a\nclear consequence of how China’s new\n“principal contradiction” in the “New Era”\nnow drives domestic policy; as Chinese citizens\nseek a “better life”, the government\nmust respond.\nTo pick one message to characterize the\nyear, it is this. In 2017, under the leadership\nof Xi, China set the trajectory, in all vital\nareas, of the country’s domestic development\nand international engagement for the\nnext 30-plus years, to mid-century, to 2050.\nEvery year brings challenges. For China,\nno doubt, big ones lie ahead. In 2018, China\nwill celebrate the 40th anniversary of\nreform and opening-up. The world is\nwatching.\nThe author is a public intellectual, international\ncorporate strategist and investment\nbanker, and China expert/commentator.

Kuhn and\n“The Watcher” commentaries.\n\nOctober 28-29, 2017 5\nCOMMENT\nOPINION\nChinaDaily\nchinadaily.com.cn/opinion\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\nNew era on the road to 2050\nIwitnessed history sitting in the Great\nHall of the People during the 19th\nNational Congress of the Communist\nParty of China. I listened raptly to\nXi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC\nCentral Committee, when he delivered his\nnew-era-defining report. I heard the\namendment to the Party Constitution that\nenshrined “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism\nwith Chinese Characteristics for a New\nEra”. I watched members of the new Standing\nCommittee of the Political Bureau of the\nCPC Central Committee walk out on stage. I\nwas awed by the presence of the leadership,\npast and present. And I was overawed by\nXi’s grand vision for China and the country’s\nincreasing, radiating confidence. Most of all,\nI marveled at the remarkable and historic\ntransformation of China, which means so\nmuch to the Chinese people and which in\nthis new era will mean so much to the rest\nof the world.\nHaving departed the Great Hall of the\nPeople, I reflected how I, an American,\nfound myself caught up in the welling Chinese\npatriotism of the 19th CPC National\nCongress. Certainly, I was experiencing firsthand\nthis inflection point in Chinese history,\nwhen China envisions itself becoming a\nfully modernized country and taking proactive\npart in international affairs, and\nregaining its leading seat at the high table of\ngreat nations.\nWhat have I just witnessed? Following are\nsome personal observations.\nA general consensus describes four primary\noutcomes of the 19th Party Congress:\nXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese\nCharacteristics for a New Era; a new\n“contradiction” that defines China’s principal\nsocial challenge; a China that takes “center\nstage in the world”; and the Party\nenhancing its leadership of society, including\nmaintaining, indeed intensifying, its\nanti-corruption campaign.\nTo me, however, a highlight was the specificity\nof Xi’s vision of China, not only establishing\npolicies for the next five years, but also\nframing the agenda and setting the strategies\nfor the next 30 years. This congress, Xi said, is\nthe “confluence” of the “Two Centenary\nGoals”: a moderately prosperous society by\n2020 (2021 being the 100th anniversary of\nthe CPC), which will likely be fulfilled within\nthe term of the 19th Party Congress, and a\ngreat, modern, socialist country by 2050\n(2049 being the 100th anniversary of the People’s\nRepublic of China), which is being\nplanned by the 19th Party Congress.\nIn a multi-meaning refinement, the path\nto mid-century is now designed in two stages.\nIn the first stage, from 2020 to 2035, the\nParty states it will build on the foundation of\nthe moderately prosperous society such that,\nafter “15 years of hard work”, the country will\nbasically realize “socialist modernization”.\nIn the second stage, from 2035 to 2050, the\nCPC states it will build on a basically achieved\nmodernization, “work hard for a further 15\nyears” and “develop China into a great modern\nsocialist country that is prosperous,\nstrong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious,\nand beautiful”. China portrays its\nmid-century self as a global leader in every\narea of human consequence: economics and\ntrade, science and technology, military and\ndefense, culture and governance.\nBut Chinese leaders, and officials in general,\nseem to have a different highlight. While\nthe “Two Centenary Goals” are certainly vital,\nespecially with new stages and specificity, they\nfocus on the amendment to the Party Constitution:\n“Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with\nChinese Characteristics for a New Era”.\n“The (Xi’s) thought is the biggest highlight\nof the 19th National Congress of the\nCPC and a historic contribution to the Party’s\ndevelopment,” said Zhang Dejiang, the\nthird-ranking member of the Standing\nCommittee of the Political Bureau of the\n18th CPC Central Committee. Liu Yunshan,\nthe fifth-ranking member, said the elevation\nof Xi’s thought to the Party’s guiding principle\nis of great political, theoretical and practical\nsignificance.\nI take a closer look at Xi’s thought: first by\nexamining each of its elements, then by considering\nits unified significance.\n“Xi Jinping” is the “core” of the CPC Central\nCommittee and of the whole Party, and\nhe thereby at the top level provides the “centralism”\nof the Party’s cardinal principle of\ndemocratic centralism.\nThe “Thought” is the totality of Xi’s fundamental\nprinciples. I see four broad categories:\npeople orientation, national\nrejuvenation, comprehensive development,\nand Party leadership.\nIn his report, Xi listed 14 categories: Party\nleadership over all aspects of society; people-centered\npolicies; deepening reform\ncomprehensively; new concept of development\n(innovation, coordination, green,\nopen, and sharing); people as masters of the\ncountry; adherence to rule of law, comprehensively\ngoverning the country by law;\nsocialist value system and cultural confidence;\nprotecting and improving people’s\nlivelihoods; harmonious coexistence of man\nand nature (ecological civilization); national\nsecurity; the Party’s absolute leadership\nover the military; “one country, two systems”\nand promoting reunification with Taiwan;\ninternational community of a shared\nfuture for all humanity; and comprehensive\nand strict Party governance.\nThe term “thought” in Chinese has special\nmeaning because before this it had been\nassociated only with Mao Zedong — “Mao\nZedong Thought”.\n“Socialism” is a set of political ideas with a\ncomplex history, unified by public or common\nownership of the means of production\nand concern for the masses.\n“Chinese characteristics” is the phrase,\noriginating with Deng Xiaoping, that adapts\nMarxism to China’s special conditions — the\nSinicization of Marxism in modern China —\nwhich includes the market playing a decisive\nrole in the allocation of resources and the\nencouragement of non-public, for-profit businesses,\nwhile at the same time State-owned\nenterprises still playing a dominant role.\n“New Era” is a new idea in the constitutional\namendment, and it is designed to\nprofoundly transform the essence of socialism\nwith Chinese characteristics into the\nvision, concepts and strategies that compose\nXi’s way of thinking.\nThe more I reflect, the more I see “New\nEra” as a conceptual lens with which to view\nthe 19th Party Congress. Semi-official Party\nanalysts say the new era answers five questions.\nRobert\nLawrence Kuhn\nWhat “road” to take? Socialism with Chinese\ncharacteristics under new historical\nconditions.\nWhat kind of country to build? First, a\nmoderately prosperous society and then a\nmodernized socialist country.\nWhat development to realize? Better life\nand common prosperity for all.\nWhat goal to achieve? The great rejuvenation\nof the Chinese nation.\nWhat contribution to make? Facilitate\nworld peace and prosperity (exemplified by\nthe Belt and Road Initiative of building\ninfrastructure in developing countries).\nThus, Xi Jinping joins only Mao Zedong\nand Deng Xiaoping in having his name\naffixed to a political philosophy in the Party\nConstitution, a blazing sign lost on no one.\nIt then would follow that the “New Era” into\nwhich China is now entering is the third era\nof the CPC and by extension of the People’s\nRepublic of China.\nA seemingly subtle but significant\nchange is the Party’s judgment of what constitutes\nthe fundamental “contradiction” in\nChinese society. (“Contradiction” is a Marxist\nterm expressing a particular way of\npolitical thinking — dialectical materialism\n— which identifies “dynamic opposing forces”\nin society and seeks to resolve the\nresulting tensions).\nThe principal contradiction has evolved\nfrom one between the ever-growing material\nand cultural needs of the people and\nbackward social production to that between\n“unbalanced and inadequate development\nand the people’s ever-growing needs for a\nbetter life,” Xi said. The needs for the people\nto live a better life are increasingly broad\nand have to be met. Not only have their\nmaterial and cultural needs grown; their\ndemands for democracy, rule of law, fairness\nand justice, security, and a better environment\nare increasing.\nThis “New-Era” contradiction, replacing\nquantitative GDP growth with qualitative\nimprovement of life, is what will drive China’s\npolicy.\nThe mission of a CPC congress is to review\nand assess achievements of the previous five\nyears, and to forecast challenges and set targets\nfor the subsequent five years (and\nbeyond). Overall, for the 19th Party Congress,\nthe ambition of the goals and the comprehensiveness\nof the categories\nwere clear,\namplified by the commitment\nto deepen reform.\nHere, by category, are\nwhat stood out.\nThe Party and the\nfight against corruption.\nConfidence in\nsocialism and the\nincreasing role of the\nParty in managing all\naspects of the country is unequivocal, and\nthe increasingly strict governance of the\nParty, by reforming and purifying itself, is\nunambiguous. Moreover, the anti-corruption\ncampaign not only continues but also\nwill be enhanced.\nEconomy. After more than three decades\nof rapid growth, China’s economy has been\ntransitioning to slower but higher-quality\ngrowth. Supply-side structural reform has\nbeen written into the Constitution. No GDP\ngrowth targets are set. The country focuses\non the real economy (as opposed to speculation,\nsuch as in the real estate sector). China\nis not backing away from State-owned\nenterprises, rather it will support State capital\nin “becoming stronger, doing better, and\ngrowing bigger, thereby turning Chinese\nenterprises into world-class, globally competitive\nfirms”.\nConsumption is fundamental in driving\neconomic growth. The framework of regulations\nmust be improved, prudent macroeconomic\nand monetary policy maintained,\nand interest and exchange rates made more\nmarket-based. For economic development,\ninnovation leads, especially in science and\ntechnology.\nPoverty alleviation. Xi has made the\nelimination of extreme poverty in China by\n2020 a cornerstone of his domestic policy.\nAfter all, how could China claim to have\nachieved a moderately prosperous society\nby 2020 if millions of its citizens would be\nstill living in extreme poverty?\nOpening-up. China reasserts its commitment\nto become more open, including\neasing market access and protecting the\nrights and interests of foreign investors.\nChina’s economists see foreign competition\nas upgrading the quality and cost efficiency\nof Chinese companies, thus better serving\nChinese consumers.\nRule of Law. Strengthening and institutionalizing\nthe rule of law, and weakening\narbitrary rule of officials, is a priority.\nReflecting Xi’s commitment, the Party is setting\nup a central leading group for advancing\nlaw-based governance in all areas,\ncoordinating the activities of judicial\norgans. The goal is to complete the transformation\nof China’s legal system by 2035 with\ntheoretical foundations and practical\nenforcement.\nEcology. Beautiful China is one of the\ncountry’s main descriptions for its second\ncentenary goal by the middle of the century.\nThis modernization is characterized by harmonious\ncoexistence between humanity\nand nature (such as nature parks) and it\nrequires substantial bolstering of regulatory\nagencies and their enforcement powers.\nArmed forces. China’s goal is to transform\nthe People’s Liberation Army into a\nworld-class military by mid-century, basically\ncompleting military reform and modernization\nby 2035, with information\ntechnology/cyber applications and strategic\ncapabilities prioritized.\nEspecially significant for Xi’s mission are\nthe two “anti’s” — anti-corruption and antipoverty\n— the former to support the Party’s\ncontinuing leadership, the latter as a prime\nexample of what the Party has delivered.\nXi does not downplay a realistic appraisal\nof problems, including social imbalances,\nindustrial overcapacities, financial system\nrisks, endemic pollution. “Achieving national\nrejuvenation will be no walk in the park,”\nXi said, an example of his plainspoken candor.\n“It will take more than drum-beating\nand gong-clanging to get there.”\nThe speculations of China watchers, and\nthe focus of the international media, have\nbeen on the new Standing Committee of the\nPolitical Bureau of the CPC Central Committee.\nBecause everything in China reports to\na standing committee member, composition\nand balance determine the vision, strategies\nand policies that will shape China.\nThis remains true today, but less true\ntoday. It is hard to overstate the significance\nof Xi Jinping’s name written into the\nParty Constitution. Xi is now, officially, the\noriginating designator and overarching\narbiter of “Thought” as it relates to “Socialism\nwith Chinese Characteristics for a New\nEra”, which is the guiding political theory of\nChina and encompasses, essentially, everything\nin China. For Xi to be named in the\nCPC Constitution is the ultimate in authority,\nsurpassing even “core” (which already\nhad superseded all other leaders), thus setting\ninto perpetuity Xi’s predominant status\nand assuring his preeminence in the\ncountry’s political life.\nThat said, to know China is to know the\nmembers of the Standing Committee. They\nare a highly competent, highly experienced\ngroup: six of the seven have run provinces\nor province-level municipalities, many of\nwhich, in terms of population and GDP, are\nthe equivalent of major nations.\nTraditional norms of balance and age are\nrespected. It’s a diverse group — by geography,\neducation and political career. They\nZHAI HAIJUN / FOR CHINA DAILY\nhave worked together, in various combinations,\nfor years. With much now being written\nabout each member, I’ll just offer some\npersonal reflections.\nFirst, of course, is Xi Jinping, general secretary\nof the CPC Central Committee, whose\nprior experience included governor of Fujian\nprovince and Party secretary of Zhejiang\nprovince and Shanghai.\nIn 2005, I was advised to study the “Zhejiang\nmodel”, which promotes entrepreneurship\nto generate economic development. I\nmet Xi, who was then Zhejiang provincial\nParty secretary, and he recommended that I\nstudy China both “horizontally” across\ndiverse regions and “vertically” through the\nhistory of its development.\n“To understand our dedication to revitalize\nthe country, one has to appreciate the pride\nthat Chinese people take in our glorious\nancient civilization,” Xi said. “This is the historical\ndriving force inspiring people today to\nbuild the nation. The Chinese people made\ngreat contributions to world civilization and\nenjoyed long-term prosperity,” he said. “Then\nwe suffered over a century of national weakness,\noppression and humiliation. So, we\nhave a deep self-motivation to build our\ncountry. Our commitment and determination\nis rooted in our patriotism and pride.”\nBut he cautioned that pride in China’s\nrecent achievements should not engender\ncomplacency.\nSecond, premier of the State Council, is\nLi Keqiang, who was Party secretary of Henan\nand Liaoning provinces. When I visited\nLi in Liaoning, he explained the complex\nchallenges of revitalizing State-owned\nenterprises while creating a fertile environment\nfor private businesses. Li shared the\nsame experience of Xi as educated youths in\nthe countryside in the 1970s. The experience\ngave them the chance to know better rural\nChina and the lives of rural people and thus\nfostered their people-orientation.\nThe following members are new:\nLi Zhanshu, who was governor of Heilongjiang\nprovince and Party secretary of\nGuizhou province, has been director of the\ngeneral office of the CPC Central Committee\nsince 2012.\nWang Yang, vice-premier, is former Party\nsecretary of Chongqing municipality and\nGuangdong province. At the height of the\nglobal financial crisis in early 2009, he\nargued it was imperative to restructure\nGuangdong’s economy, so that it can move\nup the ladder of industrialization and promote\nmore knowledge-based, high-tech, lowpolluting\nbusinesses.\nWang Huning, secretariat, is director of\nthe Policy Research Office of the CPC Central\nCommittee. Wang is well known for providing\nintellectual vision and sophistication in\nsupport of practical strategies and policies,\nranging from political philosophy to international\nrelations.\nZhao Leji, new chairman of the Central\nCommission for Discipline Inspection, has\nserved as head of the CPC Organization\nDepartment, and before that, as Party secretary\nof Qinghai and Shaanxi provinces. In\naddition to his responsibilities for Party and\ngovernment officials, Zhao provided strong\nsupport for the poverty-alleviation mission.\nHan Zheng is Party secretary of Shanghai.\nUnder his leadership, Shanghai has become\na recognized leader in trade, logistics and\nfinance.\nWhat is the impact of all this on China’s\ninternational relations?\nThere is no need to speculate. Xi himself,\nin his report, openly and boldly tells all who\nwill listen. China, he says, “has become a\ngreat power in the world”. China’s global\nengagement is proactive, confident and\ngrowing. Economics and trade drive China’s\npower, exemplified by the much-needed Belt\nand Road Initiative, but diplomacy, the soft\npower of culture and media, and the hard\npower of a blue-water navy projecting power,\nare developing rapidly.\nAs Xi said, the new era sees “China moving\ncloser to center stage and making greater\ncontributions to mankind”. The country is\nnow offering “Chinese wisdom” and “Chinese\nsolutions” to the international community —\nthe experiences and lessons of China’s\nremarkable development, especially to developing\ncountries.\nRegarding Taiwan, which exemplifies Chinese\nsovereignty, Xi painted a bright red line.\n“We will resolutely uphold national sovereignty\nand territorial integrity and will never\ntolerate a repeat of the historical tragedy of a\ndivided country,” Xi emphasized. “We have\nfirm will, full confidence, and sufficient capability\nto defeat any form of Taiwan independence\nsecession plot.”\nChina has asserted again that it is no\nthreat to any country. No matter how powerful\nChina becomes, China’s leaders say it will\nnever seek hegemony or pursue expansionism.\nNonetheless, some foreigners remain\nsuspicious, wary of China’s long-term ambitions.\nWho knows future circumstances, they\nworry? Who knows how China may change?\nAlthough I fear self-fulfilling prophecy, I am\nencouraged that China appreciates such sensitivities\nand works to build confidence.\nThe 19th Party Congress, especially Xi’s\nreport, is an epic narrative of what China has\naccomplished, what China has yet to achieve,\nand what China envisages as necessary to be\na great nation. Xi, now, carries the authority;\nhe also bears the burden.\nSetting that new target date of 2035 for\nChina to achieve basic modernization, Xi\nsees China as standing at a new historic\nstarting point and socialism with Chinese\ncharacteristics as exploring new horizons.\nChina has entered a new era and the road\nahead leads, apparently, to great nation status\nby 2050.\nThe author is a public intellectual, international\ncorporate strategist, and China expert/\ncommentator.

It is an epic narrative\nof what China has\nremarkably achieved, what China has yet to\ndo, and what China envisages as necessary\nto become a great nation.\nXi’s grand vision is famously expressed as\n“the Chinese Dream”, described as “the\ngreat rejuvenation of the Chinese nation”,\nwhich has personal and national implications.\nIt is specified by two overarching\ngoals: the two centenary goals of establishing\na moderately prosperous society by\n2020 — the 100th anniversary of the CPC is\n2021 — and establishing China as a “fully\nmodernized, socialist nation” by the 100th\nanniversary of the People’s Republic of China\nin 2049.\nThe first goal, which includes the total\nelimination of extreme poverty in the country,\nwill likely be achieved within the fiveyear\nterm of the 19th CPC National\nCongress. It is the second goal that is of special\ninterest at this time, because in drawing\nthe roadmap and formulating the policies\nto achieve China’s mid-century goal, this\nCongress may set the agenda for the next\n30-plus years.\nThe CPC national congresses are the\nhighest authority of CPC governance and\ndecision-making. The CPC constitutional\nprovision of holding congresses every five\nyears was reaffirmed by Deng Xiaoping in\nthe early days of reform (in part to establish\norder and collective responsibility after a\nperiod of chaos and political vicissitudes),\nand since 1982, Party congresses have been\nheld scrupulously on schedule.\nThe congresses establish the senior leadership\nof the Party and hence the nation by\nelecting the CPC Central Committee, which\nin turn elects all top Party positions, and\nalso the Central Commission for Discipline\nInspection; review and assess the achievements\nand challenges over the five years\nsince the previous Party Congress; set the\nvision, goals and objectives, agenda and priorities\nfor the subsequent five years; revise\nthe Party constitution (to keep up with the\ntimes); and project an image of unified purpose\nand direction to engender national\nconfidence and commitment.\nThe review and assessment of the previous\nfive years and setting the agenda and\npriorities for the subsequent five years are\nformally presented in the Report, delivered\nby the general secretary representing the\noutgoing Central Committee and thus\nreflecting the consensus view of the Party\nleadership. Ratified by the congress (after\nminor modifications), it becomes the guiding\ndocument that drives policy for the\nincoming Central Committee.\nOn the day following a congress, the first\nplenum of the new 19th Central Committee\nis convened to elect the Party’s new senior\nleadership, including the Political Bureau,\nthe Standing Committee of the Political\nBureau (to which, in essence, everything in\nChina reports), and the general secretary of\nthe Central Committee. Also approved are\nthe Central Military Commission (which\noversees the People’s Liberation Army), the\nSecretariat (which runs Party daily operations),\nand the head of the Central Commission\nfor Discipline Inspection.\nThe planning for the national Party Congress\nfollows similar patterns. Beginning\nmore than a year in advance, it involves\nboth formal and informal processes. The\nformal process includes the election or\nappointment of about 2,300 delegates\n(2,280 delegates at the 19th National Congress)\nfrom among the Party’s over 89 million\nmembers, at all levels and in all sectors,\nand the preparation of the Report via an\nelaborate system of extensive research in\ntargeted areas (involving thousands of\nexperts), solicitation of broad input, drafts\n(or sections) circulated to numerous Party\nexperts and officials for comments, and iterative\nintense reviews by higher bodies and\nsenior leaders. In addition, smaller groups\nare assigned the more sensitive tasks of\namending the Party constitution and recommending\ncandidates for the new Central\nCommittee and senior leadership positions.\nFinal decisions for this year’s congress, as\nwell as final edits of the Report, were made\nat the Seventh Plenum of the 18th CPC Central\nCommittee, held on Oct 11 to 14, days\nprior to the opening ceremony of the 19th\nCPC National Congress.\nTo understand the position and role of\nCPC Central Committee General Secretary\nXi at the 19th Party National Congress, we\nshould appreciate what it means for Xi to\nbe the core. It was in October 2016, at the\nSixth Plenum of the 18th CPC Central Committee,\nthat Xi was designated the “core” of\nthe CPC Central Committee and of the\nentire Party. The appellation was an unambiguous\nassertion that China requires\nstrong leadership to maintain stability and\nensure development given China’s unprecedented,\ncomplex challenges: domestically,\nslower growth, industrial overcapacity,\nendemic pollution, unbalanced development,\nincome disparity, social injustice,\nsocial service demands; and internationally,\nregional conflicts, sluggish economies, volatile\nmarkets, trade protectionism, ethnic\nclashes, terrorism, geopolitical rivalries, and\nterritorial disputes.\nMoreover, because China must deepen\nreform to achieve the goal of being a moderately\nprosperous society, the resistance of\nentrenched interest groups must be overcome.\nIn fact, the necessity of having a leadership\ncore to maintain stability and\nexpedite reform was a primary factor relating\nto Xi’s elevation to be the core.\nIn addition, not only does Xi have the\nresponsibility for China’s transformation;\nhe is also accountable for it. He has shown\ncourage in combating rampant practice of\ngraft, bribery and illicit patronage. Xi’s\nrelentless anti-corruption campaign is\naltering how officials in government and\nmanagers in industry work, and even how\nthey think. And let no one assume that Xi’s\nbattle against corruption has been risk-free.\nXi as the core does not change the Party’s\ncardinal principle of “democratic centralism”.\nThe Party says it is encouraging the\ndemocratic solicitation of input and feedback\nfrom Party members, lower-ranked\nofficials, and the general public; and\nstrengthening centralism through Xi’s core\nleadership.\nIn a complex world, given the diverse\ninterests and forces in Chinese society, the\nParty asserts that the Chinese Dream cannot\nbe realized without unity. Strong leadership\nis required to build and maintain unity\nfor China to continue its development.\nWhen Xi received the core appellation, he\nwas already general secretary of the Party,\nchairman of the Central Military Commission,\nand president of the country — the\nthree highest leadership positions in China\n— so how does being the “core” augment his\nperceived stature or actual power?\nThe 2016 Party plenum communique\nconfirmed that “the collective leadership\nsystem … must always be adhered to”.\nNonetheless, there must have been shifts in\nterms of both the setting of the agenda and\nmaking final decisions — or else making Xi\nthe core would have little meaning.\nWhen foreigners dismiss the political\naphorisms of China’s leaders as simplistic\nsloganeering, they miss an opportunity to\nenrich their understanding. Chinese officials\ncertainly hold Xi’s frameworks in high\nesteem.\nXi’s thought for the Party, the inner-Party\ndirectives, include the “eight regulations”\n(against waste and perks); “four self-confidences”\n(in the country’s development path,\nThe China model, Xi\nsaid, successful at home,\nalso broadens the way\nfor developing countries\nto modernize, thus\nproviding Chinese\nwisdom and Chinese\nsolutions for problems\nfacing mankind.\ntheories, systems, culture of socialism with\nChinese characteristics); opposing the “four\nevil winds” (formalism, bureaucracy,\nhedonism, decadence); the “four greats”\n(struggles, projects, enterprises, dreams).\nThe combined intent is to make Party\nmembers, especially Party and government\nofficials, more dedicated, committed, competent\nand loyal, with exemplary moral\nstandards of probity and rectitude. It is no\nsmall order.\nThe Party’s unremitting anti-corruption\ncampaign, unprecedented under Xi, has\nwon strong public support and will certainly\ncontinue. But some foreign analysts mistakenly\nsee Xi’s anti-corruption campaign\nas largely a tool of political power, thus\nreflecting a superficial and one-dimensional\nunderstanding of China. Befitting the size\nand complexity of the country, for almost\nevery decision of importance, China’s leaders\nhave multiple motivations.\nFor the anti-corruption campaign, these\nmotivations include respect for the rule of\nlaw and judicial impartiality; effective functioning\nof the Party devoid of personal\ninterests; public trust in the Party; efficient\neconomic resource allocations (corruption\ndistorts markets); expediting reform (by\nbreaking up “interest groups” that resist\nreform); maintaining national unity (by\nremoving officials with non-standard political\nambitions); elevating morality of Chinese\nsociety; restoring ethical standards of\nChinese civilization; and facilitating China’s\nemergence as a world-business center and\nglobal role model.\nXi’s thought for the country — his new\nideas, new strategies, new initiatives set\nforth over the past five years — can be\nencapsulated as the overall vision of the\n“Five in One” construction (economic, political,\ncultural, social, ecological); governance\nof the country via his “Four Comprehensives”\n(a moderately prosperous society;\ndeepening reform, strengthening the rule of\nlaw, strictly governing the Party); and\nrenewed economic development via the\nFive Major Development Concepts (innovation,\ncoordination, green, open, sharing),\nplus “supply-side structural reform”.\nSHI YU / CHINA DAILY\nXi’s thought for national rejuvenation\nincludes a grand vision for global governance,\nconsisting of eight big diplomatic concepts:\na global community of shared destiny\nand future; win-win cooperation; economic\nglobalization; fairer global governance; a\nnew kind of major power relationship;\nexpanding cooperation while managing differences;\nmultilateralism; and people-topeople\nexchanges. Moreover, Xi’s Belt and\nRoad Initiative — facilitating economic\ndevelopment in developing countries, especially\nby building much-needed infrastructure\n— is China’s “project of the century”.\nChina recognizes it has international\nresponsibilities and seeks to uphold a common,\ncomprehensive, cooperative and sustainable\nsecurity strategy. China’s own\nrequirement is to protect the country’s\nthree sacrosanct “core interests” — its political\nsystem, economic development, and\nnational sovereignty (territorial integrity).\nChina appreciates that to be a major\ncountry, with its political influence reflecting\nits economic strength, and also to protect\nits own core interests, its diplomacy\nmust be pro-active. China does not claim\nthat its “China model” can be adopted by\nother countries, but the world should\nunderstand Xi’s principles of governance as\noptimally suited for China’s domestic conditions.\nParty congresses have similar styles and\nto casual observers, they can all seem much\nthe same. But they do have differences,\nwhich are usually subtle and often meaningful.\nFor the 19th National Congress, some of\nthe things to look out for are:\nAre political frameworks and policies\nstated in their expected forms? If so, confidence\nin political and economic stability is\nreinforced.\nHow is General Secretary Xi Jinping’s status\nas “core” further stressed, as expected?\nWho are the members of the new Standing\nCommittee of the Political Bureau and\nwhat are their portfolios?\nAssuming the Party Constitution is\namended to include Xi’s new ideas, new\nstrategies, new initiatives, will they be given\nan overarching label?\nWhat is the composition of the new Central\nCommittee?\nIn listing the essential economic, political,\ncultural, social and ecological policies,\nare there shifts of emphasis that, however\nnuanced, suggest changing priorities?\nFor deepening reform, surely stressed,\nwhat targets are specified? For example,\nwhat will be stated explicitly about Stateowned\nenterprise reform?\nEnvironmental protection is a high priority,\nbut what specific regulations and\nenhanced enforcements distinguish the\nfight against pollution under Xi from those\nof previous congresses?\nMany social areas will be highlighted —\nfor example, education, healthcare, rural\nland reform, migrant worker residencies —\nbut do any stand out?\nAs already affirmed, the anti-corruption\ncampaign will continue, but will its intensity\nor direction change in any manner, will it\nbe institutionalized? How will the forthcoming\nNational Supervisory Commission\nwork?\nWhat is the relative prominence of military\nreform and modernization?\nWhat is the relative prominence of international\naffairs, given the high-profile Belt\nand Road Initiative and China’s intense,\npro-active diplomacy?\nForecasting the 19th CPC National Congress\nis not all guesswork and triangulating\nrumors. Following tradition, Xi offered to\nParty leaders a preview of his Report.\nSpeaking on July 26, he outlined China’s\nachievements since the previous national\ncongress: new concepts of development,\ndeepened reform, enhanced rule of law,\nstrengthened environmental protection,\nand a more capable military.\nChina, Xi said, has, after suffering century-long\nhardships and tribulations, taken\nthree historic leaps, from standing-up to\nbecoming better-off to becoming stronger.\nXi called for a comprehensive, strategic and\nforward-looking action program, highlighting\nthe success and vitality of socialism with\nChinese characteristics, the increasing\nstrength of the Party, and China’s expanding\ncircle of friends in the international community.\nIn China, he stressed, political legitimacy\nis founded on competence and\naccomplishment.\nSignificantly, Xi asserted that China’s\ndevelopment stands at a new historic starting\npoint and that socialism with Chinese\ncharacteristics is entering a new development\nstage. The CPC cannot rest on its laurels,\nhe stressed. The country faces daunting\nchallenges. He warned the Party against\nself-satisfaction and blind optimism.\nXi’s comments resonated with his core\nvalues and bear witness to his consistency.\nIn 2006, then Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi\ntold me that China should be proud of its\nsuccesses, but its “achievements should not\nengender complacency”, adding “we need to\nassess ourselves objectively”.\nPreparing for the upcoming congress, Xi\nrecognizes that the people’s desire for a happier\nlife is stronger than ever. They want\nbetter education, higher incomes, stable\njobs, reliable social insurance, higher quality\nhealthcare, more comfortable living conditions,\na more beautiful environment and\na richer cultural life.\nAnd there has been an inflection point in\nChina’s international perspective, reflecting\nthe nation’s consequential global engagement.\nThe China model, Xi said, successful\nat home, also broadens the way for developing\ncountries to modernize, thus providing\nChinese wisdom and Chinese solutions for\nproblems facing mankind.\nThe influence of the 19th CPC National\nCongress and the impact of Xi Jinping’s\nthought seem for decades to come.\nThe author is a public intellectual, international\ncorporate strategist, and China\nexpert/commentator.

Kuhn.\n\n16 Wednesday March 21, 2018\nFORUM\nCPC-led system a political innovation\nEditor’s Note:\nThe Two Sessions, the annual meetings\nof China’s top legislative and\nadvisory bodies, have been under\nglobal spotlight for the past few\nweeks. This year’s Two Sessions\nare of extraordinary importance as\nthey have adopted the constitutional\namendments, restructured government\ninstitutions and elected the new\nnational leadership. To understand\nwhat the institutional changes mean\nfor China’s future, as well as the\npolicy agenda for the coming year,\nGlobal Times (GT) Washingtonbased\ncorrespondent Hu Zexi talked\nto Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn (Kuhn)\nwho is a long-time China observer,\nand author and editor of over 25\nbooks. Kuhn has been invited to Beijing\nto take a closer look at this year’s\nTwo Sessions.\nGT: What kind of policy issues are\nyou following during the Two Sessions?\nKuhn: The proposed amendments\nto the Constitution of the People’s\nRepublic of China give a road map\nof areas deemed critical. Several\nof the provisions strengthen the\nstability, continuity and robustness of\ngovernance. Beyond these, I looked for\nany deviations from expectations, for\nexample, on State-owned enterprise\nreform or local government financing.\nI also looked for any reaction to the\nincreased push-back against China’s\nrising global capabilities from certain\ncountries.\nGT: In recent years, the Chinese government\nhas made more efforts to make\nTwo Sessions’ agenda better meet public\nexpectations. For example, the government\nwill cooperate with media websites\nto conduct surveys\nabout top policy areas\nthat the public wants\nthe Two Sessions to\naddress. How do you\nevaluate such efforts?\nKuhn: Irrespective of the nature of the\npolitical system or ideology, transparency\nin governance is the best way for\ngovernment to deliver effective, efficient\nprograms, and enhance credibility.\nThe Chinese government has been\nstriving to increase transparency, which\ndeserves praise.\nThe Two Sessions are a vehicle for\nthe government to communicate with\nthe people and engage them through\nmedia in dealing with all the critical\nissues.\nTWOSESSIONS\n2018\nGT: How do you see the political belief\nof China that democracy should meet the\nreal or fundamental needs of the public?\nKuhn: Government performance and\ndemocracy are not the same.\nThe former is indeed assessed by\nalleviating poverty, reducing pollution,\nimproving healthcare and the like.\nDemocracy is the public participation of\ncommon people in the complex process\nof governance.\nThus, true democracy is much\nbroader than one-person-one-vote.\nIt includes, primarily, the capacity to\nprovide substantive input on complex\nIllustration: Liu Rui/GT\nissues and to provide oversight in the\nmanagement of officials.\nGT: China for long has argued that\ndemocracy or any other political mechanism\nshould be developed on the basis\nof a country’s specific condition. How do\nyou see this belief, as well as its practice?\nKuhn: Certainly, political systems differ,\neven between countries that have\nthe same ideology. Nonetheless, there\nare great commonalities in the goals\nand objectives shared by all countries\nand people. I suspect that over time,\nmeasured in not less than decades and\nperhaps even centuries, there will be\na convergence of\nsystems toward\nwhat I call with a\nsmile, “Optimizationism”\n– leaders,\nofficials, executives\nmaking myriad decisions every day to\noptimize outcomes without thinking of\nthe ideology.\nGT: There’s talk about China’s unique\nsystem of multiparty cooperation and\npolitical consultation led by the Communist\nParty of China (CPC) during the\nTwo Sessions. How do you observe this\nsystem?\nKuhn: The benefits of a one-party-rule\nare apparent: the coherence of policies,\nrapid decision-making and formulation\nof strategies that require long-term\nconsistency for long-term commitment.\nBut all systems of governance have\ntrade-offs, and two challenges of oneparty-rule\nare assuring that all rational\npoints of view, including dissenting\nones, are included in the decision-making\nprocess; and systemic checks and\nbalances for oversight of officials at all\nlevels of government.\nChina’s system of multi-party cooperation\nand consultation, led by the\nCPC, is a political innovation in including\ninputs and ideas from diverse segments\nof society, while still maintaining\nharmony of spirit and consistency in\npolicies. But because of its scale and\npower, the CPC, which is the ruling\nparty, has a higher obligation to pay\nattention to other parties and voices. A\ntrue democracy is measured by how the\nmajority treats the minority.\nGT: As a decades-long observer of China,\nwhat do you think the constitutional\namendment will bring to the country?\nKuhn: This constitutional amendment\nis all about strengthening China’s\nsystem of governance, especially the\nParty’s leadership of the country and\nPresident Xi Jinping’s leadership of the\nParty and the nation.\nGoing by the whiplash of Western\nreactions, one could be forgiven for assuming\nthat the amendment is all about\nabolishing term limits of the president\nand vice president. In fact, there are 21\nclauses in the constitutional amendment\nand to understand where China\nis going, one must gauge the meaning\nand intent of all of them.\nXi has been consistent in respecting,\nindeed in championing, China’s\nConstitution, and by now amending it,\nhe underscores the congruity between\nthe realities of how China is governed\nand what the Constitution says – thus\nbolstering Xi’s commitment to the Rule\nof Law.\nEstablishing the National Supervisory\nLaw and Commissions, expanding\nthe anti-corruption campaign to all\npublic organs and organizations, reaffirms\nXi’s commitment to enhancing\nthe rule of law.\nAs for term limits, it is not that Xi\nwill hold the formal titles of leadership\nfor life, but that he will hold real\nleadership long enough to bring about\nChina’s national rejuvenation and establish\nChinese type democratic norms.\nAll factors considered, because of\nChina’s special conditions and Xi’s special\ncapabilities, abolishing term limits\nmay be good for China. It is commonly\nsaid that China’s system of governance\ncan ensure stability and consistency,\nwhich is a necessary requirement\nfor advancing reform.\nGT: What do you see as the underlying\nreason for the institutional\nrestructuring of the government\npassed during the Two Sessions?\nKuhn: The sweeping restructuring\nof the Chinese government\nstreamlines the bureaucracy,\neliminates institutional conflicts\nof interest between government\nbodies, aligns authority with\nresponsibility, and, significantly,\nenhances the leadership of the\nParty in the management as well\nas the oversight of the government.\nAlthough the restructuring\nhas multiple motivations, a\nprime driver is to support China’s\ncontinuing development under\ncomplex conditions – a slowing\neconomy, uncertain financial risk,\nunacceptable pollution, the special\ndemands of innovation.\nGiven China’s challenges at\nhome and abroad the government\nrestructure is timely. Some media\noutlets describe it as a “reshuffle,”\nas if the random rearrangement of\na deck of cards. I beg to differ.\nThis restructuring is as deliberate as\nit is far-reaching – and planned precisely\nto address a host of contradictions.\nThe outcome is to strengthen CPC’s\nleadership throughout the country. In\nfact, deepening reform is now defined,\nfor state as well as for Party institutions,\nas strengthening the CPC’s leadership\nin every sector. The aim is consistency\nand uniformity in implementing policy.\nThe announcement of the restructuring\nfollowed swiftly after the adoption\nby the National People’s Congress\nof the constitutional amendment, and\nalthough both were long in the works,\ntheir rapid-fire sequence serves to underscore\nthe preeminence of President\nXi in setting the new agenda, and the\npower of the Party in implementing the\nnew policies.\nGT: Environment has always been a\nheated topic at the Two Sessions. How\ndo you see the prospect of green development\nin China?\nKuhn: I have been following China’s\nenvironmental problems for over two\ndecades, and until recent years under\nPresident Xi. While officials would of\ncourse decry pollution, it only became\nprogressively worse. Companies flouted\nthe law. The minuscule fines were a\nsmall price for not worrying about the\ncost of controlling pollution. Officials\nwere loath to risk impeding economic\ngrowth. Today is dramatically different.\nPresident Xi has raised ecology and\nenvironment to the highest category of\nnational priorities. Ecological progress\nis among the five top goals (along with\neconomic, political, cultural and social\nprogress). Green is the third of the New\n(Five Major) Concepts of Development.\nThe change in attitudes toward pollution\nis stunning. For example, fines for\ncorporate pollution now hurt.\nPage Editor:\nyujincui@globaltimes.com.cn\nMonday, November 21, 2016\nA11\nCore strength\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn says those who see China’s designation of Xi Jinping as core leader to be a variation\nof strongman rule misunderstand its significance for a people navigating their way through huge challenges\nWhen, at a recent\nparty plenum,\nPresident Xi Jinping\n(���) was\ndesignated as\n“core” of the Communist Party’s\nCentral Committee, some Western\nmedia were quick to condemn the\nrise of a new “strongman”. While\nrecognising the significance of Xi as\nthe core was correct, conjuring up\nvisions of an emerging dictator was\nnot.\nI recalled my meeting with Xi\nyears earlier, when he was still party\nsecretary of Zhejiang (��) province.\nEven then he was criticising\n“empty talk” and advising, “We\nshould never overestimate our\naccomplishments or indulge ourselves\nin our achievements”.\nI took note of how Xi stressed,\n“We need to assess ourselves objectively”.\nHardly, in retrospect, the\nruminations of a gestating dictator.\nTo understand why Xi is now the\ncore, one must appreciate the\ncomplex challenges of our times.\nChina is now facing multiple challenges:\ndomestically – slow growth,\nindustrial overcapacity, endemic\npollution, imbalanced development,\nincome disparity, social\ninjustice, social service demands;\nand, internationally – wars, regional\nconflicts, sluggish economies, volatile\nmarkets, trade protectionism,\nethnic clashes, terrorism, geopolitical\nrivalries, and territorial disputes\nin the South and East China seas.\nMost critically, because China\nmust deepen its reforms to achieve\nits oft-promised goal of a “moderately\nprosperous society” by 2020,\nthe resistance of entrenched interest\ngroups must be overcome. More\nsubtly, there is what some call a\npervasive “soft resistance” – local\nofficials who do not do their job and\neconomic elites who migrate.\nIf reform had been progressing\nsmoothly, then why strengthen\ncentral authority by investing Xi\nwith the status of core leader? Xi has\nencountered obstacles; if there\nwere no obstacles, there would be\nno need for a core leader.\nI have been speaking to party\nofficials and theorists about Xi as\ncore leader. In fact, the necessity of\nhaving a leadership core to maintain\nstability and expedite reform is\nthe first and foremost of what I\nfound to be four factors relating to\nXi’s elevation.\nA second factor is that not only\ndoes Xi have the responsibility for\nChina’s transformation, he is also\naccountable for it. Moreover, he has\nshown courage in confronting and\ndismantling a vast, corrupt system\nof bribery, patronage and illicit\nwealth accretion.\nA third factor is that Xi as the core\ndoes not end, and even may not di-\nminish, the cardinal principle of\nXi Jinping as\ncore leader is\nmore a ratification\nof reality than\na shift of\nfundamentals\nBring down the curtain on this idiotic political drama\nIf you’re tired of all the politics, I\nfeel you. It’s draining, to say the\nleast, especially when the\nmelodrama in Hong Kong is\ndragging out; it has become\ndownright dreadful when we know\nthere is no respite in sight.\nWe were supposed to have a\nbrief break after last September’s\nLegislative Council polls, before the\nnext big event. Even though a large\nnumber of people will be unable to\ncast a vote in the Election\nCommittee subsector elections,\nless than a month away, and in the\nchief executive election, scheduled\nfor late March next year, the city\nshould by now be focusing on\nwhat’s ahead.\nBut, thanks to the two recently\ndisqualified lawmakers, who lacked\nthe necessary knowledge, ability\nand respect for oath-taking, our\n(albeit dysfunctional) legislature\nhas basically been shut down for a\nmonth. The ugly politics that\nshould have been insulated within\n“democratic centralism”. The party\nbolsters each of the concepts:\nencouraging the democratic solicitation\nof input and feedback from\nmembers, lower-ranked officials,\nand the public; and strengthening\ncentralism through Xi’s leadership\nof the principal levers of power (his\npositions as party general secretary,\nhead of state, chairman of the\nCentral Military Commission, and\nhead of the “leading groups” on\nreform, national security and internet\nsecurity).\nA fourth factor is that a core is\nrequired to manage the party more\nstrictly and thereby give members\nand the public more confidence.\nWitness Xi’s relentless and unprecedented\nanti-corruption campaign,\nwhich is altering how government\nofficials and industry managers\nwork and even think. Let no one\nassume that Xi’s battle against\ncorruption has been risk-free.\nSignificantly, these four factors\nundergirding Xi as the core leader\nmap onto his overarching political\nframework, his strategic blueprint\ncalled “The Four Comprehensives”\n– a moderately prosperous society,\nreform, rule of law, party discipline.\nXi’s core status arises, we’re told,\nthrough the collective will of the\nparty and the people. Becoming\nparty core is not an automatic\nconsequence of being general secretary;\na core leader must fit the\ntimes and the status must be\nearned.\nSpeaking at a press conference\nfollowing the 18th Central Committee’s\nsixth plenum last month,\nHuang Kunming (���), executive\nvice-minister of the committee’s\nPublicity Department, said that the\n“central and local departments as\nwell as the military all expressed\ntheir support” for Xi’s position as\nparty core, adding that this decision\nAlice Wu has had enough of the brouhaha over the\noath-taking by two lawmakers. Now that they’ve\nbeen disqualified, HK must focus on battles ahead\nthe chamber once again spilled out\nonto our streets.\nAnd what should have been\ndecided and concluded on\nSeptember 4 is now dragging on\nindefinitely, with two or possibly\nmore by-elections added to the\nelection overload.\nHell-raising politics is not going\naway any time soon, but the sheer\nstupidity of the localist pair’s\nactions really is one for the books –\nMacbeth, in fact:\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and\ntomorrow, / Creeps in this petty pace\nfrom day to day,\nTo the last syllable of recorded\ntime, / And all our yesterdays have\nlighted fools\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out,\nwas “based on the valuable experience\nof the party and we feel keenly\nabout it”.\nHuang explained that “a core is\nneeded to ensure that the party will\nbe the governing party”, describing\nit as significant for upholding the\nCentral Committee’s authority and\nmaintaining the central, unified\nleadership of the party and for its\n“staying true to its mission”.\nTherefore, party theorists\nexplain, Xi as core leader is more a\nratification of reality than a shift of\nfundamentals.\nWhat does Xi as core mean in a\nhistorical context? It was Deng\nXiaoping (���) who introduced\nthe concept when he designated\nJiang Zemin (���) as “core of the\nthird generation” of central leaders,\nbolstering Jiang’s stature following\nhis unexpected appointment as\nparty leader in 1989. At the time,\nChina was facing the dual impediments\nof economic stagnation and\nsocial uncertainty at home, and\neconomic quarantine and diplomatic\nisolation abroad. As Deng\npointed out: “Any leading group\nshould have a core; a leadership\nwith no core is unreliable.”\nOnly then did Deng retrospectively\napply the novel term to Mao\nZedong (���) and to himself, as\ncore of the first and second generations,\nrespectively. (Of course,\nMao was so utterly dominant that\ncalling him core during his lifetime\nwould have seemed a demotion.\nDeng remained core even when he\nno longer held any official position.)\nToday’s world is more complex.\nChina faces threats at home and\nabroad. Volatility grows and uncertainty\nabounds – the Middle East\nand Donald Trump are offered as\nevidence. The need to secure\nChina’s stability is more essential\nthan ever, and thus to strengthen\nbrief candle! / Life’s but a walking\nshadow, a poor player\nThat struts and frets his hour\nupon the stage / And then is heard\nno more. It is a tale\nTold by an idiot, full of sound\nand fury, / Signifying nothing.\nThey were indeed full of sound\nand fury, and they did nothing for\nthe common good.\nWhat they did opened the door\nfor an invitation to the courts to\nintervene. What they did presented\nan opportunity for an\ninterpretation of the Basic Law by\nthe National People’s Congress\nStanding Committee.\nWhat they did, ultimately, may\nwell become the precedent for\nother legislators to be similarly\nXi’s authority is a primary reason,\nI’m told, for designating Xi as core\nleader. Party theorists say China\n“urgently” requires a political nucleus\nthat is sophisticated and\nnuanced, attuned to contemporary\ntimes. Though conditions now\ndiffer from those in 1989, Deng’s\nadmonition rings timelessly true.\nHowever, that a core leader is\nneeded now does not mean one will\nalways be needed. When China\nbecomes a fully modernised nation,\nperhaps by mid-century, condi-\ntions may change again.\nTrue loyalty is\ntelling leadership\nin private what\none really\nbelieves is in their\nbest interests\nI hear frequently of the “painful\nlessons of China’s century of blood\nand tears” and that for China not to\nhave a tested and authoritative\nleadership core would be “unthinkable”.\nParty inner talk says “Xi\nJinping has passed the test of the\npeople” to be China’s political core,\nleadership core, and a core of the\ntimes.\nChinese scholars argue that\n“core” is a unique characteristic of\nChinese political theory – however\ninapplicable (even inexplicable) in\nWestern political theory. They call\nWestern concerns that Xi as core\nleader means that “a new emperor\nis born” wildly unfounded, even\nparanoic. In feudal society, the\nemperor ruled unconditionally\nbarred. And that is why the duo’s\npledge to spend every penny – and\nlest we forget, this also means the\nmounting cost to the public purse –\nto “appeal at all costs” is beyond\nrich, coming from them.\nClearly, they have yet to wrap\ntheir heads around the concept of\n“personal responsibility”. Sixtus\nBaggio Leung Chung-hang is\nwrong in believing that their\ndisqualification from Legco\nrendered the election meaningless.\nThey have no one but themselves\nto blame for their defenestration. It\nis they who made the election\nmeaningless.\nAnd, to add insult to the grave\ninjury they brought on the rest of\nus, they are asking for donations. At\nsome point – if we’re not there\nalready – we must take serious\noffence to be taken as fools, again\nand again. The curtain must now\nbe drawn on this overly played-out\nsecond act.\nThe irony may be lost on the\nwith arbitrary imperial power, and\nin such a “command-obey” system,\ngoes the argument, there is simply\nno need for a core.\nRather, given today’s party political\nstructure, the concept of a core\nboth strengthens cohesion and\nserves to prevent a personality cult,\nnot to promote one. Having a core\nmeans acknowledging that the\nparty system is not the “emperor\nsystem” – absolute power is rejected\n– and that the optimum system, at\nleast for the foreseeable future, is a\ncombination of concentrated centralism\nand democratic collective\nleadership.\nCorroborating this functional\nbalance, in the communiqué issued\nfollowing the sixth plenum, the\n“collective leadership system” is\nreconfirmed. It states: “The implementation\nof collective leadership\nand personal division of labour is an\nimportant component of democratic\ncentralism and must always\nbe adhered to.” And it stresses: “Any\norganisation or individual shall,\nunder any circumstance, not be\nallowed to violate this system for\nany reason.” The three “any’s” seem\nno accident.\nSome analysts see contradictions.\nOn the one hand, the\ncommuniqué calls for democracy\nand constructive criticism internally\nwithin the party. On the other,\ndisobeying the central leadership is\nforbidden, backed by vigilant\nsupervision and tough discipline.\nYet to read these statements as\ncontradictory is to misunderstand\nwhat is happening here. Xi appreciates\nthe complex and arduous tasks\nthat lie ahead. He told me so a\ndecade ago, and it is obviously truer\ntoday than it was then. The statements\nare harmonised, first, by the\nparty’s motivation to seek optimum\npolicies for the country, and second,\nby keeping most of the divergent\nviews internal.\nTrue loyalty is telling leadership\nin private what one really believes is\nin their best interests, not pandering\nand fawning by repeating what one\nthinks leadership wants to hear.\nThough there are concerns, no one\nhere worries that Xi will become\nMao.\nChina is now the world’s largest\ntrading nation and its second-largest\neconomy. China’s diplomacy is\nexpanding and its military is growing.\nFrom its Belt and Road initiative\nbuilding infrastructure and facilitating\ntrade in over 60 developing\ncountries to its leading role in the\nUN peacekeeping forces, China, the\n“Middle Kingdom”, is involved in\nevery meaningful matter of international\naffairs.\nSo, what kind of China do we\nwant? Certainly not one with weak\ncentral leadership and fragmented\ncitadels of power. With its huge and\nimbalanced population, and its\ndiverse culture and traditions,\nChina today requires a leader with\nsufficient strength and prestige to\nsecure social stability, drive economic\nreform, and guide it in being\na responsible world power. Xi as\ncore leader should be good for\nChina and, thus, for the world.\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn is a public\nintellectual, political/economics\ncommentator, and an international\ncorporate strategist.

We can ill afford to be\ndistracted by those who\ncontinuously try to foolishly make\ntheir own stupid mistakes our\ncollective problem.\nAlice Wu is a political consultant and\na former associate director of the\nAsia Pacific Media Network at UCLA\nThe basic law\nof unintended\nconsequences\nMike Rowse says the continuing\npolitical tussles in HK illustrate the\npain of being caught in a cycle of\nactions and reactions, and we must\naddress the root cause of the grievances\nThere has been a considerable focus recently on\nthe Basic Law and the rule of law, and their\ninteraction. Perhaps neglected in the process has\nbeen a different but relevant concept: the law of\nunintended consequences, whereby an action gives\nrise to outcomes unforeseen by the instigator.\nHong Kong’s tortuous path towards political reform\nis a case in point. The first reference to the idea of\nuniversal suffrage for selection of the chief executive\ncomes in Article 45 of the Basic Law, promulgated back\nin 1990. Looking towards 1997, its purpose was to\nreassure. Naturally, attention turned to the subject in\nthe early part of this century. While people understood\nthat the move towards universal suffrage had to be in\naccordance with the “principle of gradual and orderly\nprogress”, the reform package put forward in 2014 was\nwidely perceived as disappointing; the plan to stick\nwith an unrepresentative nominating committee\ndeciding who could enter the race was unpalatable.\nThe State Council’s white paper on the governance\nof Hong Kong, intended to set things straight, only\nstirred things up and led to the Occupy Central\nprotests. The government let the action linger, hoping\npublic anger would pay dividends in the 2016\nLegislative Council election. While the 79 days of\ndisruption did bring the protesters momentary\nopprobrium, memories quickly faded. In the election,\nthe pro-government share of the vote actually fell, and\nthe attack on the idea of independence led directly to a\nnear 20 per cent share of the vote for a localist faction.\nThis was surely not the objective.\nNow the government is trying to overturn the\nelection outcome. The practice of banning some\npotential candidates from standing, then using all\nmeans at hand to unseat some of those elected, is a\ntactic more usually associated with third-world\ncountries following a military coup.\nHas something been lost in\ntranslation here? Perhaps\nwe need an interpretation\nof the interpretation\nIn the short term, the judicial review sought by the\nchief executive against the decision by Legco president\nAndrew Leung Kwan-yuen to give Sixtus Baggio Leung\nChung-hang and Yau Wai-ching another opportunity\nto take the oath has been successful. Mr Justice\nThomas Au Hing-cheung ruled in the High Court that\ntheir oaths were invalid, they should not be given a\nsecond chance and their positions should immediately\nbe vacated. Many observers thought he might decline\nto rule at all, and simply refer the matter back to the\nLegco president. The problem with one arm of the\nadministration delving too deeply into the processes of\nanother is that it inevitably generates more requests to\ndo so. And, sure enough, we now have legal challenges\nagainst more legislators, plus a challenge against the\nchief executive himself.\nGiven that, in the past, other Legco members who\nhad politicised their swearing-in and then done it\nproperly second time round were permitted to take up\ntheir seats, did Leung and Yau have a “legitimate\nexpectation” that they would enjoy similar treatment?\nThe Legco president certainly thought so, hence his\noriginal ruling. Now it is for a higher court to decide.\nMeanwhile, the National People’s Congress\nStanding Committee has sought to clarify Article 104 of\nthe Basic Law, which requires all people concerned to\n“swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong\nspecial administrative region of the People’s Republic\nof China and swear allegiance” to it. But the\ninterpretation is different: it talks of “a legal pledge … to\nthe People’s Republic of China and its Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region” (emphasis added). Has\nsomething been lost in translation here? Perhaps we\nneed an interpretation of the interpretation.\nIf, at the end of the day, there are two (or more)\nvacant Legco seats, then we are in by-election territory.\nI don’t think the people are fooled for one minute\nabout what is going on. In each constituency, an\nimpeccable opposition candidate will stand, win a\nmajority, and take the oath impeccably. Unfortunately,\nthis tragedy – or farce – will continue until the\ngovernment starts to address the underlying\ngrievances over the lack of meaningful political reform\ninstead of just hammering the symptoms, which\ngenerates new grievances in the process.\nMike Rowse is the CEO of Treloar Enterprises and an\nadjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nmike@rowse.com.hk\n> CONTACT US: Agree or disagree with the opinions on this page?

I’ve not\nworried because tariffs don’t work; they are\nblunt instruments in a globalised economy,\npenalising American companies and\nconsumers as much as Chinese. Most\nAmerican experts oppose tariffs, and President\nDonald Trump likes to make big deals\nafter making big threats.\nBut I am now worried over what I will\ncall “a looming tech war”, because the\nstructural imperatives go deeper.\nAs everyone who follows China knows,\nthe US Department of Commerce has imposed\na denial of export privileges\nagainst ZTE, China’s second-largest telecommunications\nequipment manufacturer,\nthus prohibiting US companies from\nselling essential electronic components\nand software to ZTE, a crippling sanction.\nChina has responded resolutely, with\nactions that seem selected from expert scenario\nplanning, and with rhetoric, both indignation\nand nationalistic bravado.\nFrom China’s perspective, according to\nits Ministry of Commerce, “If the United\nStates attempts to curb China's development\n… it miscalculates. The action targets\nChina; however, it will ultimately undermine\nthe US itself,” affecting tens of thousands\nof jobs and hundreds of related US\nenterprises.\n“Targeting technology is like throttling\nthe neck of the Chinese enterprises,”\nwrote China Daily. “The ZTE case should\nremind China's decision-makers of the\nurgency to become self-sufficient in core\ntechnologies.”\nPresident Xi Jinping has been prescient\nabout domestic control of core technologies,\nespecially related to the internet and\nmore recently to artificial intelligence.\nSince taking office in 2012, he has stressed\nthe “hidden risks” that come with core\ntechnologies not being mastered domestically.\nHe said, “Heavy dependence on imported\ncore technology is like building our\nhouse on top of someone else's walls: no\nmatter how big and how beautiful it is, it\nwon’t remain standing during a storm.”\nInnovation is the first of Xi’s “five major\nconcepts of development”.\nBeijing also claims\nthat the country itself\nis a victim of\ndiscriminatory\npolicies\nFrom the US perspective, according to\nits Department of Commerce, the prohibition\nagainst ZTE is punishment for ZTE violating\nUS sanctions against Iran and North\nKorea, making false statements and obstructing\njustice, and then after reaching a\nsettlement agreement, violating it.\nThe United States claims it is not resisting\nChina’s rise, but rather the country’s\nunfair or illegal means to achieve it. The US\naction enumerated four such practices as\nrationale for imposing punitive tariffs, all\nrelating to technology or intellectual property:\nforeign firms in China are required to\nform joint ventures and transfer knowledge,\nas well as license technology with\nbelow-market terms and conditions, while\nthe state supports Chinese enterprises in\nacquiring foreign hi-tech assets, and sanctions\ncommercial cyber theft.\nPresident Trump is wildly unpopular\namong American elites, especially among\npolicy experts, who do not need much of an\nexcuse to criticise him – note the fusillade of\nattacks on Trump’s tariffs. But these elites\nare not criticising Trump on US moves to\ncounter what they, with unusual consensus,\nperceive to be China’s unfair policies,\nand in some cases unlawful programmes,\nto become a world leader in state-of-the-art\ntechnologies, especially AI, information\ntechnology, robotics, advanced manufacturing,\nnew energy vehicles, aviation and\nbiotechnology.\nChina claims that it is still a developing\ncountry, so different rules apply, a foundational\nprinciple of the World Trade Organisation.\nBeijing also claims that the country\nitself is a victim of discriminatory policies\nrestricting its imports of hi-tech products.\nOf course, China had to respond with\nappropriate actions as well as confident\nwords, imposing heavy tariffs on US\nsorghum and signalling that additional\nagricultural tariffs were at the ready, along\nwith barely veiled threats against US companies\noperating in China.\nHere’s my fear. While I have argued that\nmost mainstream American experts are not\nmotivated to impede China’s rise, as many\nin China believe, I can no longer make that\nargument persuasive.\nIn the US, there has been a dark turn\namong experts that US policy towards\nChina, calibrated over four decades to\nshepherd China’s rise, has failed: China,\nthey have come to believe, has become a\ncompetitor and may become an adversary,\nand that US relations with China must now\nbe managed as with an emergent adversary,\nnot as with a developing partner.\nIn China, nationalistic voices are on the\nrise, castigating the US for its self-serving\nmotivation to impede China’s rise, and calling\nfor China to become more self-reliant,\nmore rapidly, especially in world-class\nsemiconductors, so that the country would\nnot be vulnerable to US “blackmail”.\nWelcome to the unhappy world of selffulfilling\nprophecy, where the actions of\neach side in response to a perceived threat\nfrom the other side increases the likelihood\nof that threat morphing from theoretical to\nactual.\nTo both sides, I offer two pieces of\nadvice. First, take a breath and a fresh look,\nbecause the road on which you are travelling\nwill not lead to a happy place.\nSecond, contemplate why the other side\nis misinterpreting your actions. To my\nAmerican friends, what makes China think\nthe US is resisting its rise? To my Chinese\nfriends, what makes the US think that\nChina is a competitor and may become an\nadversary?\nProjecting malevolent motives and seeing\nsinister conspiracies is the easy way out.\nIt can solicit cheers and plaudits in one’s\ndomestic media, but it will impede progress\nand is likely to be self-defeating.\nThe US and China must each figure out\nhow not to confirm the other’s self-fulfilling\nprophecy.\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn is a public intellectual,\ninternational corporate strategist and\ninvestment banker, and China expert and\ncommentator. He is the author of How China’s\nLeaders Think and a co-creator (with Adam Zhu)\nand host of CGTN’s “Closer to China with R.L.\nKuhn” and “The Watcher” commentaries\nOlder people still\nhave lot to offer\nin the workplace\nPaul Yip says measures to ensure\nHong Kong retirees remain active\nthrough employment may help\nprevent poverty and partially offset\nthe impact of a declining birth rate\nEmployment is the most robust method for\nkeeping people out of poverty. In Hong Kong’s\nlatest poverty situation report, for those with a\njob, the poverty rate is only 12.3 per cent, compared to\n77.4 per cent among those not working. Among older\nadults with a job, it is 12.9 per cent, compared with 48.2\nper cent among those without employment.\nChief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung has\nrecently raised the possibility of promoting workforce\nparticipation for those aged 50-64 and helping those\naged 65-74 re-enter the job market. Hong Kong’s\nworkforce participation rate among older adults is 17.7\nper cent, lower than in Japan (22.7 per\ncent), Singapore (26.8 per cent) and Seoul (31.5 per\ncent).\nThe Japanese government has been very active in\npromoting workforce participation among its older\ncitizens, especially since 27 per cent of its\npopulation was aged 65 or over as of 2017. The\npopulation size has decreased, from 128 million in\n2010 to 127 million in 2015, and the United\nNations estimates that the number will continue to fall\nuntil 2061. The number of migrants moving to the\ncountry has not offset the population decrease, leaving\nno choice but to improve the labour participation and\nproductivity rate, especially among older adults and\nmarried women with children.\nThough Hong Kong’s total fertility rate is only 1.2\nper woman – less than the 1.4 in Japan – we have\nbenefited from migration from the mainland to keep\nour population young. Our life expectancy is also very\nsimilar to Japan’s, at 81 for men and 87 for women. It is\ntime to explore how to make better use of our older\nThe most important thing is\nto provide an option for\nolder adults to be active in\nthe job market\nGreater effort is required to foster gender diversity\nKevin Sneader and Anu Madgavkar say the Asia-Pacific region needs more women leaders\nWomen’s representation in highranking\npositions in business\nand politics is a global issue, but\nan even more pressing one in Asia-Pacific.\nAcross the region, only one in five people in\nleading roles is a woman.\nThis waste of women’s talent comes at\nan economic cost. Many economies in the\nregion are ageing and skills shortages are\non the rise: making more of women’s\npotential can help meet such challenges.\nBusinesses gain a great deal from\nsupporting women. McKinsey’s 2018\nreport “The Power of Parity” found that\ncompanies in the top quarter for gender\ndiversity on their executive teams are 21\nper cent more likely to experience aboveaverage\nprofitability.\nEven in developed economies in the\nAsia-Pacific, few women are getting to\nthe top in business – in Japan, there are no\nfemale CEOs in the top 100 public\ncompanies. In Australia and Singapore, the\nshare of women CEOs in 2016 was only 6\nper cent and 5 per cent respectively. The\nPhilippines, a traditionally matriarchal\nsociety whose government has been\nproactive in tackling gender inequality,\ndoes better in senior positions overall, but\nonly 3 per cent of CEOs and 15 per cent of\nboard members are women.\nThe lower share of women in leading\npositions within companies isn’t all about\nthe glass ceiling – the point at which\nwomen’s careers appear to halt. Rather,\nwomen’s under-representation has its\nroots as far back as the education system.\nIn India, only 44 per cent of students in\ntertiary education are female and many\ngraduates don’t take up employment: only\n25 per cent of entry-level positions in\nIndian companies are taken by women. In\nJapan, the share of women enrolled in\ncollege is higher, at 47 per cent, but women\nwere only 28 per cent of students attending\nthe top 10 universities.\nThe share of women erodes sharply\nfrom entry-level to the boardroom, and the\nbiggest “breakpoint” is motherhood. In a\n2015 McKinsey survey, 45 per cent of Asian\nexecutives cited the “anywhere, anytime”\nperformance model as the largest barrier\nto women moving into senior roles. In\nJapan, a survey found that three-quarters\nof women respondents said they were not\ninterested in managerial positions, partly\nbecause promotion would mean working\neven longer hours.\nThe second most cited factor behind\nwomen dropping out of work is the\n“double burden” of holding down a job\nwhile looking after the family. In China, 33\nper cent of female respondents to a 2017\nsurvey said that they had a lower salary\nwhen they returned to work after having a\nbaby, and 36 per cent said they had to\naccept a demotion. Sixty-three per cent\nsaid they did not want a second child\nbecause this would hurt their career.\nMany women struggle to return to work\nbecause childcare options are limited or\ntoo expensive. In Australia, net childcare\ncosts (paid by two-earner families) were 20\nper cent of an average family’s income in\n2015, compared with the 13 per cent\naverage in OECD economies.\nThe attrition of women from the talent\npipeline starts even earlier than\nmotherhood, as societal attitudes militate\nagainst women pursuing a career and\nprioritise looking after families. In India, 70\nper cent of respondents to the 2010-2014\nWorld Values Survey agreed with the\nstatement, “When a mother works for pay,\nthe children suffer.”\nMore can be done to\ngive women the\nfreedom to choose a\ncareer as well as\nmotherhood\nThere has been some progress. The\nshare of women on company boards has\nbeen rising, reflecting efforts by both\ngovernments and private-sector\norganisations. India has made it\nmandatory for companies to have at least\none female director, and the Australian\nSecurities Exchange Corporate\nGovernance Council tracks gender\ndiversity in its constituent companies.\nJapanese pharmaceutical company\nTakeda hit its target of 30 per cent of new\nmanagers being women (from only 6.2 per\ncent in 2015) through a range of initiatives\nincluding flexible working hours.\nHowever, there is much more that can\nbe done to give women the freedom to\nchoose a career as well as motherhood.\nNarrowing the leadership gender gap will\nrequire concerted action by governments\nand companies from encouraging and\nhelping girls to learn the right skills for a\nchanging labour market and mentoring\nwomen in their careers, to shifting\nattitudes towards women’s roles through\npublic-awareness campaigns to – perhaps\nmost importantly – making work flexible.\nMore help with childcare is urgently\nneeded. Governments can use public\nspending to expand childcare provision\nand companies can set up nurseries.\nFlexible working practices in companies\nare vital. In Australia, financial services\ncompany Suncorp enables flexible\nworking through “work at home hubs” that\ncombine home work stations and working\nspaces in regional shopping centres.\nSuch efforts are only likely to be\neffective with a root-and-branch shift in\nattitudes towards women’s roles in society.\nGovernments can lead from the front,\nsetting targets for women’s representation\nin business as Japan and Singapore have\ndone, and more companies can push for\ntrue diversity within their ranks. Doing so is\nnot only in the interests of their bottom line\nbut the health of the economies in which\nthey work.\nKevin Sneader is chairman, Asia-Pacific, of\nMcKinsey & Company. Anu Madgavkar is a\npartner at McKinsey Global Institute\nadults. We should create the right environment\nfor raising the retirement age and extending\nemployment beyond that age. Some issues, like\nexcessive health and medical insurance costs for the\nolder workforce, and long working hours, should be\nre-examined.\nThe government can create a fund to protect\nagainst excessive increases in insurance costs, while\nintroducing a more flexible working arrangement for\nthe older workforce.\nThe most important thing is to provide an option\nfor older adults to be active in the job market, and give\nthem the choice of whether to continue in a job. Those\nwho have had enough could perhaps take on volunteer\nwork in the community. For those who stay on with\npaid employment, more flexible time arrangements\nwould better suit their needs, while their roles could be\nredefined so as not to stand in the way of the career\nadvancement of younger workers. Some tangible\nsupport might be needed for the business sector,\nideally through a tax-deductible arrangement rather\nthan the proposed cash support.\nFor some work, such as in teaching and research,\nthe situation depends on individual ability. As in\noverseas countries, participants should be allowed to\nwork as long as they meet expectations. At present, a\nvigorous review process takes place to determine\nwhether to extend beyond retirement age.\nThe education levels of Hong Kong’s older adults is\nnot high and, among those with very low levels, most\ncan only find work in low-skilled jobs such as cleaning\nand security duties. Nevertheless, these areas face a\nshortage of labour and can be a good fit. In such cases,\npeople’s rights and pay should be better protected, to\navoid companies exploiting this group of workers.\nAlso, sometimes, older adults are not driven by\nmoney when seeking work. For some, finding meaning\nin their work can be sufficient. The Japanese\nexperience shows that some older adults continue to\nwork to maintain their independence and fitness. Such\nworkers, whatever they do, display high levels of\nprofessionalism.\nRespecting the wishes of older adults and providing\na quality choice in terms of working would be a winwin\nsituation for the whole community.\nPaul Yip is chair professor (Population Health) in the\nDepartment of Social Work and Social Administration at the\nUniversity of Hong Kong\nFor some, finding meaning in work is important, as with\nthese women who recycle used clothes to make bags.\nComment›Insight & Opinion › United StatesUS-China trade\nUS-China trade war could end with\na ‘big deal’ through baby steps\ntowards mutual understanding\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn says the US must accept China’s\nneed to support technological development, while China\nshould work with US policymakers who oppose tariffs but\nwant the country to further open its markets and protect\nintellectual property rights\nPUBLISHED : Thursday, 30 August, 2018, 5:02am - UPDATED : Thursday, 30 August, 2018, 6:15am\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\nPresident\nXi Jinping\nMajor Speech\nSeattle\nSeptember 24, 2015\nRobert\nLawrence\nKuhn\nSimultaneous\nCommentary\nQuest\nMeans\nBusiness\nChina’s\nXi Jinping\nUN Speech\nRobert\nLawrence\nKuhn\nInterview\nSeptember 28, 2015\n\nCNN’S AMANPOUR – May 29, 2013\nPresident Xi Jinping to meet President Barack Obama\nInterview with Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn,\nlong-time adviser to China’s leaders.\nhttp://edition.cnn.com/video/#/video/world/2013/05/29/exp-­‐race-­‐china-­‐us-­‐amanpour.cnn\nCHRISTIANE AMANPOUR, CNN HOST: Good evening.\nI'm Christiane Amanpour. There may officially be only one\nsuperpower today, but another is rapidly advancing. The\nUnited States and China jockey for position at the pinnacle of\nthe world in what might just be called a race to the top. So\nhow will the first tete-a-tete go between their leaders, the two\nmost powerful men on Earth, U.S. President Barack Obama\nand China's leader, Xi Jinping, will meet just over a week\nfrom now in an informal setting at the aptly named\nSunnylands Estate just outside Los Angeles. China is\nanxious and angry about Obama's much-touted “pivot” to\nAsia and about what China perceives to be the U.S. siding\nwith Japan over disputed islands in the East China Sea. The\nUnited States, for its part, has a laundry list of concerns,\neverything from alleged Chinese hacking of even its most\nsensitive military secrets to its influence over North Korea\nand Pyongyang's nuclear saber-rattling. President Xi says the\nU.S.-China relationship is at a crucial juncture and he says\nthat he wants to forge, \"a new type of great power\nrelationship.\" So what exactly will that look like? We need\nto know because this may just be the most important\nrelationship in the world today.

Welcome.\nKUHN: Pleasure to be here.\nFZ: First, give us a sense of who this man is for\nour viewers. Who is Xi Jinping, and why is he a\nlittle different from China’s ordinary leaders?\nKUHN: Xi Jinping has been involved in all aspects\nof what makes China today. His father was one of\nthe founders of the country, truly a great\nrevolutionary and a great reformer in the early\ndays. Xi Jinping graduated from Tsinghua\nUniversity [‘China’s MIT’], with a degree in\nchemical engineering. Then he went through\nmore than two decades working at the local level.\nStarting in a county, and then a city, Xiamen,\nworking his way up for many years in Fujian\nprovince, becoming the governor. Then for five\nyears Xi was the Party Secretary of, the number\none official responsible for, Zhejiang province,\nwhich is the center of entrepreneurship in China.\nSo that gives him a great sense of business. And\nthat was when I first met Xi Jinping, actually, in\n2005, and then again in 2006, seeing him doing\nthe real work of running a province, a local area.\nPresident Xi is a person, when you see him, who\nis unassuming; he’s big, he has a strong presence\nin a room, but you feel very comfortable with\nhim. He doesn’t put on airs, he’s very warm and\nBBC World News\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\nChina’s Economy & Politics\nPresident Xi’s ‘Four Comprehensives’\nAugust 25, 2015\nHOST: Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn is an advisor to the\nChinese government and author of How China’s\nLeaders Think and he joins me now from Beijing. A\ncut in interest rates today - but in China any economic\ndecision is always colored with politics.\nRLK: Certainly people are concerned here, but you\nhave to realize a 43% drop in the Shanghai stock\nmarket is still 25% above its 52-week lows, so what\nthe economists, government, tries to do is to\ndistinguish between the so-called real economy and\nthe stock market. Most people realize China’s stock\nmarket was overvalued, but perception is reality, and\nif people have less money on paper, they’ll spend less,\nand so the fall will affect the real economy.\nAnd you’re right, the way to look at such situations in\nChina is not just economically - you can’t look at\nChina without looking at politics, and here there are\ntwo major areas. One is President Xi Jinping’s state\nvisit to Washington. This has been a very tense time\nin Sino-US relations: South China Sea, cybersecurity,\nhuman rights, lots of issues. But what this economic\nuncertainty and volatility will do - I hope - is to make\nboth presidents focus on what really affects human\nbeings and human lives, focus on economic areas,\nbecause this is where there can be some commonality\nbetween China and the US. The contentious issues are\nreal, but economics is more real for people.\nDomestically in China, it’s really interesting, because\nin recent days, there have been editorials in People’s\nDaily talking about extreme resistance to reform and\nolder leaders who are still involved and maybe\nshouldn’t be, and so you have to look at domestic\npolitics in terms of what Xi Jinping, who is China’s\ndominant leader, the president of the country, head\nof the party, head of the military, and other titles as\nwell, and what his overarching policy is.\nIt’s called the “Four Comprehensives.” We learn from\neach one.

The designated theme —\ngoverning through the rule of law — indicates how important\nthis meeting will be for the future of both the Party and the\ncountry.\nThat this is the first time in 17 years the Party has designated\nsuch a theme for a plenary session speaks volumes about the\nimportance the new leadership attaches to it. It is high on the\nagenda.\nYet, the more the concept of rule of law has been discussed,\nthe more obvious it becomes that there is, today, much to be\ndesired.\nMore than 50 minister­level or higher officials have either\nbeen indicted or placed under investigation for abuse of power\nin the past year or so, underlining the fact that the rule of law is\nsorely needed. It is perhaps the only way to eliminate, once\nand for all, the most serious threat to good governance and to\nsecure the blessings of prosperity and justice to the people.\nThe fact that power today can effectively nullify the law, and\nthat those in power can circumvent it, not only deprives the\nParty of its capacity to govern the country in a consistently fair\nand just manner but also disrupts the reasonable running of\nthe marketplace. Abuse of power makes it impossible for fairness\nto prevail in the socialist market economy.\nDespite the great achievements China has made over more\nthan three decades, it will be very difficult for its economy to\ngrow in a sound manner — and neither will society progress in\na healthy way — unless fair competition and mutual trust can\nbe secured and ordinary people’s rights and interests can be\nguaranteed through the rule of law.\nIf the country is to achieve further reforms in various fields\nand establish and maintain a fair and just society, the powerworshipping\nmentality among government and Party officials\nmust be eliminated. This is a core goal of the leadership.\nUnless the overwhelming majority of Party and government\nofficials not only respect the law, but follow it when making\ndecisions, governing the country by the rule of law will\namount to little but lip service.\nIt will be no easy job, and it will take time for the power­oriented\nway of doing things to be transformed. But the new Party\nleadership has shown it has the courage to face the\nchallenge. We therefore have reason to expect much from the\ncurrent plenary session as they work to put the country on the\nright track.\nCONTACT US\nCHINADAILY\nA foundation of law\nO T H E R V I E WS\nHistoric moment\nChina Daily\n15HuixinDongjieChaoyang, Beijing100029\nNews: +86(0) 106491­8366; editor@chinadaily.com.cn\nSubscription: +86400­699­0203; sub@chinadaily.com.cn\nAdvertisement: +86(0) 106491­8631; ads@chinadaily.com.cn\nPhone app: chinadaily.com.cn/iphone\nChina Daily USA\n1500Broadway, Suite2800, New\nYork, NY10036+12125378888\neditor@chinadailyusa.com\nChina Daily Hong Kong (Asia)\nRoom1818, HingWaiCentre7TinWan\nPrayaRoadAberdeen, HongKong\n+85225185111\neditor@chinadailyhk.com\neditor@chinadailyasia.com\nE D I T O R I A L\nhe convocation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 18th Com­\nParty of China Central Committee, whose theme is\nTmunist\npromoting the rule of law, embodies the CPC’s deepening perception\non governance and the law.\nwww.people.com.cn October 15.\nt is the first time that the CPC, as the ruling Party, will make a\nIcomprehensive plan on the rule of law in the form of a Party document.\nThe session, which marks the ruling Party’s significant\nstrategic layout on how to govern the nation in accordance with\nlaws and the Constitution, illustrates its new exploration of socialism\nwith Chinese characteristics.

Can analyzing\nthe book elucidate Xi’s thinking\nand illuminate China’s future?\nConsider seven frameworks or\nperspectives: publishing purposes,\noverarching themes, content analysis, chain of\ndevelopmental causation, domestic goals, domestic\nmeans and global principles.\nPublishing Purposes: substance,\nsymbol, signal. Substance means Xi’s political philosophy\nand wide­ranging policies — organizing 79\nspeeches and commentaries in 18 chapters — to\ndiscern how Xi intends to realize the Chinese\nDream, “the great rejuvenation of the Chinese\nnation”. Symbol means recognizing Xi’s emergence\nas China’s leader, with greater authority, confidence\nand support than observers had expected\nwhen he first took office two years ago. Signal\nmeans communicating Xi’s way of thinking to\nglobal audiences in nine languages, an original\nand explicit outreach to engage the world on multiple\nlevels.\nOverarching Themes: pride, stability, responsibility,\nvision. Pride expresses the yearning of the\nChinese people for the “great rejuvenation”. Stability\nmeans maintaining the current political system\n(Socialism with Chinese characteristics and the\nParty’s leadership). Responsibility means “realizing\na moderately prosperous society by the centenary\nof the Party in 2021”. Vision means “turning\nChina into a prosperous, democratic, culturally\nadvanced and harmonious modern socialist country\nby the centenary of the People’s Republic of\nChina in 2049”.\nContent Analysis. How does Xi impute importance\nto topics? By examining what’s in Xi’s book,\ncan we explore what’s on Xi’s mind? Of the book’s\n18 chapters, 11 relate to domestic affairs, seven to\nforeign affairs; six have political relevance; six concern\nstandards of living; and four standards of\nL I M I N\nbehavior. Categorizing the content, about a third is\npolitics and people; another third on international\nrelations; about 15 percent each on reform and\ndevelopment, and society and culture; and about 8\npercent on national security and defense. Pervasive\nthroughout is reform.\nChain of Developmental Causation. The\nChinese Dream is founded on political stability,\nwhich enables far­reaching reform, which in turn\npromotes economic development, and which,\nwhen combined with rule of law and Chinese values,\nstrengthens China’s society, culture, ecology\nand even defense. Where is this “chain of causation”\nin Xi’s book?\nThe first and last chapters affirm political stability:\n“Socialism with Chinese Characteristics” and\n“The CPC Leadership”, both of which assert the\nParty’s political primacy and thus assure social stability.\n“The Chinese Dream” is the second chapter,\nproclaiming the grand mission of national resurgence\nand personal well­being. Then, chapters on\ndeepening reform and economic development,\nwhich lead to chapters on rule of law, advanced culture,\nsocial undertakings and ecological progress.\nDomestic Goals: values, morality, prosperity,\nfairness, happiness. Values: Xi’s vision is to inculcate\nChina’s traditional values — “the thoughts of\nthe ancient sages”, exemplified by Confucianism —\ninto socialist core values. (“We must take traditional\nChinese culture as the base.”) Morality: Derived\nfrom values, morality is described as “conscious\nlaw”, and “civic morality” is characterized as needing\nimprovement, while “paragons of morality are\nimportant banners for building public ethics”. (“A\ngentleman takes morality as his bedrock” — a traditional\nvirtue that Xi quotes.) Prosperity: “Common\nprosperity is the fundamental principle of\nChinese socialism … We will accelerate China’s\noverall prosperity”. Fairness: Because the Chinese\npeople have always had a perception that “inequality\nrather than want is the cause of trouble”, Xi\nsays, China “should do a better job of promoting\nMinister of Commerce Gao Hucheng\narrived in the lobby of the European\nCommission’s headquarters at 9\no’clock on Saturday morning. He was\nled to the office of outgoing Trade Commissioner\nKarel De Gucht, who has been a thorn in the side\nof Chinese businesses because of his protectionist\nattitude ever since he took over the job in 2010.\nDe Gucht, 60, will be replaced in a few days by\nSwedish politician Cecilia Malmstrom, 46, when\na newly constituted commission gets underway.\nIn the afternoon, the Chinese side announced a\nlong­awaited agreement in principle: Brussels\nwill not launch an investigation into subsidies of\nChina’s telecommunication imports into the\nEuropean market. The EU side still needs to go\nthrough internal procedures for formal approval.\nThe threat was mainly targeted at Chinese telecommunications\nequipment makers Huawei\nTechnologies Co and ZTE Corp.\nWhile the big picture of relations has been a\npositive one, the Europeans have annoyed Beijing\nfrom time to time — for example, by allowing the\nDalai Lama to visit, by attacking China on human\nrights and by imposing high trade barriers.\nDespite such irritants, Beijing has sent constructive\nsignals. In the first half of this year, President\nXi Jinping paid the first­ever visit of a\nChinese president to the European Union’s headquarters.\nAnd last week, at the summit of Asian\nand European leaders in Milan, Italy, Premier Li\nKeqiang hosted a special dinner for Barroso and\nEuropean Council President Herman Van Rompuy,\nthanking them for their contributions to positive\nrelations. At the dinner, the leaders were\nthought to have touched on the telecommunication\ntrade dispute, which involves about 1 billion\neuros ($1.26 billion) annually.\nThe path to Saturday’s solution was similar to a\npattern set earlier, in mid­2013, after both sides\nworked through an anti­dumping and anti­subsidy\ninvestigation involving China’s multi­billiondollar\nsolar panel exports to the EU. Brussels\nbegan that investigation in 2012.\nBeijing was unhappy that there had been no\nhigh­level invitation to visit Brussels a year after\nthe launch of the investigation.\nIn May last year, Li made his first trip to Germany\nafter taking office and won the support of\nthe German government, which vetoed Brussels’\ndecision, following dozens of EU member states.\nLi made a last­minute call on Barroso the following\nmonth, as Brussels was about to vote on\nwhether to end the solar panel dispute through\namicable consultation.\nLi’s decisive role was crucial in preventing the\nescalation of a trade war. If Beijing had opted to\ndeal with such disputes in an eye­for­eye, toothfor­tooth\nmanner, both sides would have been\nlosers, with the EU taking the brunt. It has\nalready suffered two economic recessions, and\nits jobless rate has been in double digits for a\nfew years now.\nOf course, with the trade volume between China\nand Europe expanding, and with investment\npouring into Europe, China’s government, its\nbusinesses and its media must work to make the\nmost of the rising economic tide.\nfairness and justice”. Happiness: The Chinese\nDream, Xi says, is to “bring happiness to the Chinese\npeople”, to “ensure the people greater happiness”\n— but, he cautions, “happiness does not fall\nfrom the sky, nor do dreams come true automatically.”\n(In Xi’s book, “values” occurs about 120\ntimes, “morality” 24, “prosperity” 67, “fairness” 44\nand “happiness’’ 16.)\nDomestic Means: close to the people, realism,\nstability, reform, rule of law, combating corruption.\n“Close to the people” is an all­encompassing\nway of thinking that shapes all decisions. Realism:\n“I have repeatedly said that the great rejuvenation\nof the Chinese nation can in no way be realized\neasily,” Xi says. “While fully affirming our achievements,\nwe should also be aware of our shortcomings.”\nStability: The precondition for all else,\nstability is a recurrent and foundational theme\n(“stability” occurs 125 times). Reform: Those who\nwonder whether Xi is a “real reformer” should\nread “Explanatory Notes … Concerning Comprehensively\nContinuing Reform” (page 76). Examples:\nthe market plays a “decisive role”; farmers\ngiven transactional property rights; the judicial\nsystem separate from the administrative system.\nRule of Law: “A fundamental principle” and “the\nbasic way to run the country” — the Fourth Plenary\nof the 18th CPC Central Committee, focusing on\nrule of law, is Xi’s call to action. Combating corruption\nis a hallmark of Xi’s administration, enhancing\neach of the five other domestic means. It is no\naccident that the chapter on combating corruption\nis positioned, significantly, between “Close Ties\nwith the People” and “The CPC Leadership”.\nI bear witness to Xi’s consistency. In 2006, Adam\nZhu (my long­term partner) and I met privately\nwith then­Zhejiang Party Secretary Xi. He stressed\nthat while China should be properly proud of its\nsuccesses, “achievements should not engender\ncomplacency”. Xi said: “We need to assess ourselves\nobjectively.”\nGlobal Principles. Consider five. Independence\n(China remains unaligned). Multi­polar\nworld (no country dominates). One country, two\nsystems (Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan). Peaceful\ndevelopment (“We have made a solemn pledge to\nthe whole world that we will never seek hegemony”).\nMultilateral affairs (cooperation with the\nglobal community). These five global principles\ndrive China’s “new model of major country relations”\n(primarily with the US), “neighborhood\ndiplomacy” (Japan, Vietnam, Koreas, etc.), and\n“cooperation with developing countries” (such as\nin Africa). The Silk Road economic belt (land route\nand maritime) is President Xi’s new initiative for\nmultinational development.\nHere’s my blurb for Xi’s book: “This book is a\nmilestone, both in substance and symbol, offering\nopenly the political philosophy of President Xi Jinping\nand recognizing his emergence as China’s\nsenior leader. While misunderstandings about\nChina and its leadership abound, there is now no\nneed to speculate about President Xi. Here is how\nhe thinks, candidly and comprehensively.” It is the\npride of a patriot.\nThe author is an international corporate strategist\nand political/economics commentator. He is\ntheauthorof How China’s Leaders Thinkanda\nbiography of former president Jiang Zemin. He\ngave one of the speeches at the launching ceremonyfor\nXi Jinping: The Governance of China,at\ntheFrankfurtBookFaironOct8.\nF U J I N G\nCourtesy, not confrontation, best for Europe\nSo far, there is no unified Chinese business\ncouncil in Brussels to represent and lobby for\nChinese investors in Europe. By contrast, a major\nUS business organization reportedly has 300 staff\nmembers focusing on Brussels’ policymaking.\nA lack of communication and influence can\neasily lead to misunderstandings. Bureaucrats in\nBrussels usually follow Washington’s lead when\nmaking policies that affect China.\nTrade commission leaders need to make more\nfield trips to member states to learn how Chinese\nbusinesses matter.\nTake China’s solar panel exports for example.\nThe industry, which involves about 400,000\nworkers in China, has offered competitive products\nto thousands of European upstream companies\nand helped Europe achieve its status as a\ngreen energy leader.\nIn telecom, Huawei and ZTE are deeply integrated\nwith European partners. And, incidentally,\nHuawei is a steady job creator in Europe, where\nyoung people, in particular, have faced huge\nemployment challenges.\nIf De Gucht had kept the big picture in mind,\nhe would not have made confrontational moves\nagainst China and its businesses.\nOverall, the EU recognizes China as strong strategic\npartner. This is the starting point for dispute\ncontrol. Amicability helps both sides win. With\nconfrontation, everyone loses.\nThe author is China Daily chief\ncorrespondent in Brussels.\nfujing@chinadaily.com.cn\n\n������������� ������ �������\n��� ������ ������� �� ��� ��� ���� �����\nP A G E 3 2\nLast word\nC H I N A D A I L Y E U R O P E A N W E E K L Y J U L Y 1 3 - 1 9 , 2 0 1 2\nThe insider with an outside view\nstrategist, Banker and author has intimate knowledge of China — and its leaders\nBy Andrew Moody\nandrewmoody@chinadaily.com.cn\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn says\nthe West often doesn’t\nunderstand the Chinese\nleadership’s key priorities\nfor China. The 67-year-old American\nis seen by many as one of the few\nfigures outside the world’s secondlargest\neconomy who actually does.\nHe is regarded as a knowledgeable\ninsider, having been an adviser to\na number of leading Chinese bodies\nsince the late-1980s and knowing\nmany of the country’s top political\nfigures personally.\n“There is rarely alignment between\nwhat topics China’s leaders think are\nimportant about China and what\nthe world thinks,” says Kuhn, also\nan international corporate strategist\nand investment banker. “Understanding\nChina requires knowing the\ndifference.”\nHe was speaking recently in the\nfive-star Grand Hyatt hotel in central\nBeijing, which is his home for 90 days\na year. The rest of the time he divides\nbetween his three homes in the United\nStates and traveling elsewhere.\n“They treat me very well here.\nEven when I travel around China, I\nkeep a room here,” he says.\nThe hotel is well placed near to\nChina’s seat of government around\nTian’anmen Square where he has an\nextensive network of contacts.\nHis latest book, How China’s Leaders\nThink: The Inside Story of China’s\nPast, Current and Future Leaders,\nwhich is now out in paperback and\nmore than 500 pages, goes into\nextensive detail about those who\nhave the responsibility for shaping\nmodern China.\nKuhn, who cuts a dapper figure,\nsays many in the West often have an\noutdated view about modern Chinese\nleaders.\n“The reality is that China’s leaders\nare meritocratic,” he says.\n“Many have strong academic backgrounds\nfrom top universities and\nall have significant experience, often\nhaving run two or more provinces or\nmajor municipalities as Party secretary,\ngovernor or mayor.”\nKuhn, who is also a new China\nDaily columnist, is much in demand\nfrom major news organizations\naround the world, including TV\nappearances on BBC, CNBC, Euronews\nand Bloomberg TV, and says he\nhas had complete freedom to express\nhis opinions.\n“I have written three books about\nChina, dozens of articles and columns;\nI’ve produced two major TV\ndocumentaries about China and\ngiven scores of media interviews —\nand never has anyone in China even\nrequested to censor anything I’ve\npublished or broadcast outside of\nChina,” he says.\nSome in the West, however, have\naccused him of being too much of an\ninsider and not giving the full picture\nabout China because he was too close\nto the leadership.\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn says China’s growth is good for the world, but it cannot save the world.\n“I deem it vital, considering China’s\nimportance in the world, that\nChina’s leaders become more known\nto the world, and known not just via\nsound-bites and photo ops, but by\nseeing them up-close as real people\n— hearing their own words, listening\nto their stories, getting their ways\nof thinking. I’m pleased to facilitate\nsome of this,” he says.\n“I also offer my own analysis. As\nfor my accuracy and understanding,\nreaders or viewers can judge for\nthemselves.”\nKuhn, who was born in New York,\nbegan his career as a scientist. After\nstudying biology at John Hopkins\nUniversity, he did a doctorate in\nanatomy and brain research at the\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles\nin the 1960s. Brain science and\nconsciousness remain major interests\nof his.\nHis first involvement in China was\nthrough the scientific community in\nthe late-1980s when he worked with\nscientists reforming China’s research\nand technology base. He received an\ninvitation from Song Jian, then a\nState councilor and chairman of the\nState Science and Technology Commission.\nAt the time he was developing a\nparallel business career and became\npresident of The Geneva Companies,\na leading US mergers and acquisitions\ncompany, which he eventually\nsold to Citigroup in 2000.\nAt the same time he was cementing\nlinks with leading business and\npolitical figures in China.\nHis organization, The Kuhn Foundation,\nwith CCTV (China Central\nTelevision), produced the documentary\nIn Search of China for PBS in the\nUS, which was broadcast in 2000.\nHe is now working on a new fivepart\nseries China’s Challenges, which\nwill be broadcast in China in the\nautumn and syndicated to PBS stations\nin the US next year.\nPerhaps Kuhn’s most significant\nproject was writing a biography of\nformer president Jiang Zemin, which\nwas the best-selling book in China\nin 2005.\nHow China’s Leaders Think was\nbased on interviews with more than\n100 leading Chinese political figures,\nsome of whom he has known for\nmore than a decade.\n“I know many personally and have\nworked with several for a number of\nyears. When you hear them speak\nover a period of time, it gives you\na sense of their personalities and\ncharacter as well as their intellectual\ncapabilities, leadership style and\npolitical progress,” he says.\nKuhn sometimes likes to invoke\nhumor to explain why there is sometimes\nfriction between Chinese and\nAmerican leaders.\n“Some people think it is because\nfeng yongbin / China Daily\nof ideological, historical or cultural\nreasons that we have communication\nproblems. As I once pointed out,\nperhaps it’s because China’s leaders,\nthe members of the Politburo Standing\nCommittee, were trained as engineers,\nand most American politicians\nwere trained as lawyers. Maybe the\nproblem is that lawyers and engineers\ncan’t talk to one another!”\nKuhn says the main focus in the\nWest is often the Chinese economy\nand whether it will continue to\nmotor ahead.\n“China should have 10 to 20 more\nyears of what we should still call relatively\nhigh growth, driven by continuing\nthe country’s unprecedented\nurbanization and modernization.\n“Growth rates will naturally ease\nfrom reform’s historic averages —\nprobably to 6 to 8 percent per annum\n— which is less than we are used to,\nbut which may be optimal because\nChina can more effectively deal with\nits most severe problems, particularly\neconomic and social imbalances\nand sustainable development.\n“However, China’s economy is fragile,\nvulnerable to exogenous shock.\nChina’s growth is good for the world,\nbut it cannot ‘save the world’,” he\nsays.\nKuhn says there is often a danger\nof China being misrepresented\nbecause it is seen through a narrow\nperspective.\nBIO\nRobert Lawrence\nKuhn\nInternational corporate strategist,\ninvestment banker, senior adviser\nto multinational corporations and\nauthor\nAge: 67\nEducation:\n• Bachelor’s degree in human biology,\nJohns Hopkins University, 1964\n• PhD in anatomy and brain research,\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles,\n1968\n• Master of sciences in management,\nMIT Sloan School of Management,\n1980\nCareer:\n• President and co-owner of The Geneva\nCompanies, a US leading mergers\nand acquisitions company (sold to\nCitigroup in 2001)\n• Chairman, The Kuhn Foundation,\nwhich produces documentaries on\nscientific and philosophical questions\nas well as on China issues\n• Author of The Man Who Changed\nChina: The Life and Legacy of Jiang Zemin\nand How China’s Leaders Think, as\nwell as 25 books on business strategy,\nfinance and investment banking\nBooks: The Inflationary Universe: The\nQuest for a New Theory of Cosmic\nOrigins by Alan H.

I can be\nwrong, and maybe my\ntruth is not balanced.\nLu Feiran\nChina expert and American public intellectual,\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn is best known in\nChina for two books about Chinese leaders\nand their views, including a biography of\nformer President Jiang Zemin in 2005 and one about\nother leaders and their thinking in 2009.\nKuhn, also an investment banker, business consultant,\nbrain scientist and philosopher, has been\ngranted unprecedented access to Chinese leaders,\nthough he does not speak Chinese.\nHis biography “The Man Who Changed China:\nThe Life and Legacy of Jiang Zemin” published in\nboth Chinese and English, was a best-seller in China\nwhere readers are not accustomed to humanized\nbiographies of leaders.\nIt was probably the first biography written by a\nforeigner about a living Chinese leader that was\npublished in China.\nKuhn has also produced documentaries on China,\nwritten extensively for Chinese media and is often\nquoted by western media. He is a contributor and\nconsultant to CCTV, some Chinese newspapers and\nthe Xinhua News Agency.\nKuhn sees his mission as telling the world about\nthe real China.\nHe was in Shanghai late last month for an International\nChannel Shanghai (ICS) program he\nco-produced and wrote about China’s challenges, in\nconjunction with the 18th National Congress of the\nCommunist Party of China. He held a press conference\nand also spoke with Shanghai Daily.\nChinese media sometimes accuse some Westerners\nand Western media of China bashing, saying they\nmisunderstand or are even malevolent.\nBut 68-year-old Kuhn, a New Yorker, is believed\nto have a more neutral view for China. He received\na bachelor’s degree in human biology from Johns\nHopkins University, a master’s of science in management\nfrom the MIT Sloan School of Management,\nand a PhD in anatomy and brain research from\nUCLA.\nHis books were published by the Shanghai Translation\nPublishing House and Shanghai Century\nPublishing Group.\nKuhn said he “never tried to please the Chinese\ngovernment, though Western media thought I did.”\n“I like feedback, including negative feedback,\nbecause I know that people are engaged,” he told\nShanghai Daily.\n“I don’t try to make anybody happy, but I just want\nto tell the truth. I can be wrong, and maybe my truth\nis not balanced.”\nKuhn’s experience with China started in 1989,\nwhen he was invited by former State Councilor Song\nJian, director of the State Science and Technology\nCommission.\nThe two became friends and Kuhn began traveling\nbetween the US and China, getting to know government\nofficials and ordinary people.\nKuhn said he felt frustrated because his experience\nin China differed from the description in much of\nthe Western media. “Then they only focused on the\nnegative side and ignored the rest,” he said.\nThat disparity inspired him to write Jiang’s biography,\nhe said. Jiang himself said that Kuhn didn’t\n“beautify” him and got his wedding date wrong.\nKuhn spent four years writing “The Man Who\nChanged China.” Though he had only met Jiang three\ntimes and did not interview him for the book, he\ntalked to many people close to Jiang, including relatives,\nfriends and colleagues, gathering stories and\nperceptions. He became close to many of them.\n“I thought I had been rather familiar with China\nbefore I started working on the book,” said Kuhn.\n“But after I started collecting the information, I\nfound that my knowledge was very limited.”\nHumanized leader\nKuhn said he was determined to depict a real, animated\nJiang, different from the seemingly impassive\nfigure appearing on state occasions, on Chinese TV\nand in newspapers.\n“For a very long time, Chinese leaders were either\ndescribed as God or the Devil, but never in-between,”\nhe said. “So I expected to display a Chinese leader\nwho is a human being.”\nSoon after publication, it became a best-seller in\nChina. After Kuhn held a book-signing in Guangzhou,\nGuangdong Province, more than 300 books\nwere sold in an hour. In Shanghai, more than a\nmillion copies were sold in 2005, the highest in the\nsocial science category.\nChinese readers called the book refreshing because\nit told daily life stories and described Jiang’s\nyouth.\nOne Internet user called “Burn the scarecrow” said\nbefore reading the biography, he thought Jiang was\n“a quiet man standing high above the masses.”\n“But after reading the book, my first feeling was\nthat he was once young like us and he is also an\nordinary man.”\nThe English version, however, received some criticism,\nprimarily that Kuhn was “fawning” over Jiang\nand the government. Kuhn denied that.\n“In fact, the book had a disclaimer, saying all\nWisdom comes with Global People\n读环球人物获人生智慧\n第 32 期总第 201 期\n2012 年 12 月 6 日\n美国将军腐化生活\n罗阳 , 没喝上最后的庆功酒何亮亮 :“ 廉政公署不可复制 ”\n苹果设计团队的秘密领袖有种气质叫 “ 桂纶镁 ”\nwww.globalpeople.com.cn 售价人民币 10 元港币 20 元邮发代号 :82-667\nCOVER PEOPLE\n封面人物\n情地与他们聊天 , 再从庞杂的素材中挑选自己需要的故事 ……\n库恩坦言 , 在写这本书的过程中 , 自己与江泽民仅仅在公开场合见过 3 次面。\n“1993 年 , 江泽民对古巴进行国事访问 ,\n住在古巴国宾馆 , 当时 , 我也在那里。我站在走廊上 , 而他正好也走了出来。那是我们的第一次见面。 ”2000 年 9 月 , 江泽民赴纽约参加联合国千禧年首脑峰会 , 他在一次招待会上第二次见到江泽民。 3 年后 , 库恩又在北京听了江泽民关于几个重要问题的讲话。尽管没采访到江泽民本人 ,\n库恩却并不觉得有什么遗憾。在他看来 ,\n这本书只是传记而非自传 , 没必要非采访到本人。为了完成这本书 , 库恩总是随身带着手提电脑 , 一有空就开始写作 , 从周一到周五 , 他常常工作至凌晨。每当他在吃完饭后一头钻进书房 , 妻子总会调侃他 “ 又去见江泽民了 ”。整整 4 年 ,3 次重写 ,5\n次编辑 , 库恩光资料就搜集了 3000 万字 ,\n第一稿 70 万字 ……\n2005 年 , 一本 47 万字的《他改变了中国 —— 江泽民传》出版。首批印刷的 20\n2006 年 3 月 , 库恩在浙江与习近平会谈。万册 , 仅 10 多天就销售一空。为新书做巡回推广时 , 由于签名数量太多 , 库恩的手肘甚至有些劳损 ,“ 影响了打网球 ”。走访中国 40 多个城市《他改变了中国—— 江泽民传》的成功 , 让库恩有了进一步探寻中国整体形象的想法。他于是带着助手 , 开始走访中国\n40 多个城市 , 进行深入的、大规模的调查研究。就是在这次调研过程中 ,2005 年 2 月\n26 日 , 库恩在浙江西子宾馆见到了时任浙江省委书记习近平。习近平向库恩介绍了浙江的经济、历史和文化等方面的情况 ,\n并感谢库恩多年来从自己独到的角度研究中国、向世界介绍中国 , 在中美两国之间搭起了文化的桥梁。次年 3 月 , 库恩再次来到浙江 , 这一次 , 他的目的是了解 “ 浙江模式 ”。虽然是不期而至 , 但习近平仍挤出时间与他见面。习近平说 , 自己之所以要这么做 , 是要 “ 表示我们对库恩先生关注中国、客观介绍中国的感激之意 ”。库恩回忆说 , 习近平在那次谈话中强\n调了中国自改革开放以来发生的翻天覆地的变化。 “‘ 有句老话 , 士别三日当刮目相看。你一个月不来 , 半年不来 , 中国就会有很大的变化。 ’ 他又补充说 ,‘ 但如果结合中国悠久的历史来分析 , 又不会惊讶于它变化之快 , 因为我们经历了几千年才走到这一步。无论我们怎么看待这一速度 ,\n中国的发展变化 , 至少在一定程度上 , 是由爱国热情和民族自豪感推动的。 ’”\n让库恩印象最深的是 , 在谈及如何以最好的方式向世界介绍中国时 , 习近平提出 , 中国的情况无法用简单的一句话来描述 , 或用单一的方法来概括 , 并借用中国古代寓言 “ 盲人摸象 ” 来说明这个问题。 “ 他把中国富裕的东部沿海比作大象的腿 , 而将中国广袤的西部比作大象宽阔的后背 ,\n认为 ‘ 象是一个完整的概念 , 必须全面地了解 , 要避免犯盲人摸象的错误 ’。 ” 对库恩来说 , 这样的比喻是新颖而有用的 , 这个说法 , 他到现在还记得。接连的调研 , 让库恩对中国有了更深入的认识。\n2007 年 12 月 9 日 , 时任中宣部部长刘云山在与库恩的一次会谈中提议 , 如果由他来写一部关于中国改革 30 年的书 ,\n一定很有意义。库恩知道 , 这次又说到他心坎上了。库恩列出了一份庞大的采访名单 , 每次采访前 , 他会向被采访对象提供三四十个问题的采访提纲 , 后者通常会选择其中的二三十个作答。采访结束后 , 库恩再根据采访录音进行整理 , 并对其中提及的年份、数字和事实进行核实。在与 100 余位省部级官员、企业领袖和专家学者沟通交流 , 并采访了诸多改革开放的亲历者后 , 库恩用 5 个月时间完成了 80 万字的初稿。 “ 我的家人说 , 整整一年 ,\n他们只能看到我的后脑勺。 ”\n2008 年 12 月 ,《中国 30 年 : 人类社会的一次伟大变迁》中文版在中国发行。第二年 , 为纪念新中国成立 60 周年 , 该书英文版在全球出版发行。截至目前 , 这本书是唯一由外国人详细描述中国改革开放 30 年进程的书籍。\n编辑 | 张建魁肖莹美编 | 苑立荣图编 | 傅聪编审 | 刘爱成丁子\n31\n库恩十年十人政治□ 本刊记者凌云\n讲述中国政坛\n10 年变迁\n. 16 .\n2016 年 1 月 11 日 , 库恩在北京接受本刊记者专访。 ( 本刊记者傅聪摄 )",
