  "text": "Ti v4 Expert Analysis\n\nm Joint returns may be filed, usually as an\namended return with a refund claim,\nuntil the three-year limitations period\n(or the two-year payment period, if\nlater) expires. For individuals who filed\n2009 tax returns on or before April\n15, 2010, the limitations period for\nthat year is closed. For those who filed\ntheir 2009 returns on an automatic six-\nmonth extension on October 15, 2010,\nhowever, the limitations period for the\n2009 tax year remains open until Oc-\ntober 15, 2013. To claim joint return\nstatus on an amended 2009 tax return\nunder the three-year rule, both married\npartners’ original tax returns must have\nbeen filed within that extended period.\n\nm ‘Taxpayers who filed protective refund\nclaims prior to the Supreme Court’s deci-\nsion should be on the alert to any forth-\ncoming IRS guidelines that may facilitate\nthe agency's processing of those claims.\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nm ‘Taxpayers who had a lower combined\noverall tax liability filing as unmarried sin-\ngle individuals during an open year appear\nto be under no obligation now to file an\namended return to file jointly (or as mar-\nried filing separately if at least one partner\ndoes not consent to a joint return).\n\nIRS Audit Policy. Technically, the IRS, on\naudit of an open year for which any previ-\nously-filed return by a married, same-sex\npartner used unmarried, single-filer status,\nmay be able to require that tax be recom-\nputed based on either a joint return, or mar-\nried filing separately status return. However,\nsince audits are under IRS’s discretionary\npowers, the consensus among at least some\npractitioners, is that IRS National Office\nmay —and more likely will— direct agents\nto by-pass any filing-status issues unless the\ntaxpayer requests a change.\n\n2013 Tax Year. For 2013 returns that will be\nfiled in 2014, the Supreme Court’s Windsor\ndecision presumably relates back to the entire\n2013 tax year in determining filing status.\n\nCOMMENT. Married partners do not have\nthe option to file short-year returns as un-\nmarried for the January I — June 26, 2013\nperiod, they must file jointly or married fil-\ning separately for the entire 2013 tax year.\n\n2012 Tax Year. Taxpayers who are on exten-\nsion until October 15, 2013 for filing their\n2012 tax year returns appear to be required\nto file those returns either jointly or married\nfiling separately. Taxpayers who filed their\n2012 tax year returns before June 26, 2013,\nas separate, unmarried individuals, however,\nmay not need to change their filing status to\nmarried filing joint if it would be less favor-\nable to their overall tax liability. The IRS\n\nmay issue guidance on this issue.\n\n@) Wolters Kluwer\n\nCCH\n\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029314",
