  "text": "Though the environment was one of tranquil academic scholarship, | lived charged\nwith anticipated performance anxiety about the seminars on the brain as a\ndynamical system | was scheduled to present to these (| feared) ready-to-be-\ndisdainful, prize-winning, pure mathematicians and theoretical physicists.\n\nMy dorm-style sleeping room at /HES was, in winter, painfully cold and\ndrafty; the narrow iron bed’s thin mattress contained lumps of persistently disturbing\ndreams, the small scratched table for work shim-irreparably wobbled. A faded\nposter of Van Gogh’s garden was tacked crookedly on the door facing the toilet in\nthe dank, dimly lit small bathroom. A dwelling for distracted young mathematicians.\nA retired but still famous Parisian chef cooked many course, elegant meals every\nafternoon. The food was accompanied by so many liters of unlabeled red wine and\npeer pressure to be French and socially drink it that it became a choice between\ndulled, blunted,. sleepy post-prandial afternoons or living on bread, many cheeses,\napples and Perrier water, alone in my room. | chose the latter.\n\nThom’s gifts to us _ theoretically oriented non-mathematicians were\ndiagrammatic, easy-to-visualize pictures that allow the intuitive capture of counter-\nintuitive discontinuities in functions. How we might imagine that a smooth and\ncontinuous change in a cause of something can lead to a big, discontinuous change\nin the results. His system of topological (shape not size) diagrams was useful when\nconsidering up to four causal variables and one to two dependent variables that\ndescribed how things behaved.\n\nFor an important real life example, in modern clinical pharmacology, the\nsmooth dose-response curve consistent with the physician’s intuition that if a little\ndrug didn’t work, a little more may do so, should become an up and down search for\nthe dose-region for the desired effect which may involve a lower amount than a\npreviously ineffective drug dose. The therapeutic effect may occur in the middle of a\nnarrow dose range with too much or no effect occurring out of this span. In many\nphysical systems, sudden and global transitions in state, from incoherent light rays\nto coherent lasing and from laminar flow of fluids to turbulence, emerge\nunexpectedly when causal parameter are moved into what some call the critical\n\nregion of the values of control parameters. Outside this region, cause and result\n\n53\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013553",
