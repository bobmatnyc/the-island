  "text": "pressure leads to a global qualitative change in physical state. Analogously, the loss\nof topological equivalence occurs at the fixed point that, for examples, splits into two\nor explodes into a cyclic orbit in phase space. The same critical point behaviors and\nquantities occur in a wide variety of specific processes and their equations, and they\nare independent of the way the trajectories first arrived in the fixed point\nneighborhood. Once the system enters the regime of critical behavior, the predictive\nsignificance of its dynamical history is lost. This may also be the case for emergent\npsychiatric disorder (Mandell et al, 1985; Mandell and Selz, 1992; Ehlers, 1995;\nPaulus et al, 1996; Huber et al, 1999).\n\nThere are diagnostic patterns of behavior when a nonlinear system is in a\nneighborhood of a potential bifurcation. They include sudden and/or large jumps\nresulting from a small change in experimental conditions, the appearance of big\nbaseline fluctuations (anomalously large variance), the lengthening of the time\n\non\n\nrequired to relax following evoked or spontaneous perturbation (“critical slowing”),\nthe same global change in state occurring at different values of the parameter when\nincreasing versus decreasing a parameter’s value (“hysteresis”), the existence of\nsome range of values of the observable that cannot be attained by manipulation of\nthe parameter (“inaccessibility”) and the availability of two or more distinct states in\nthe same parameter neighborhood (“modality”) (Thom, 1972; Arnold, 1984; Gilmore,\n1981). It is perhaps relevant to polydrug psychopharmacology and clinical\nmanagement that the higher the co-dimension (the greater number of effective\nparameters being manipulated), the greater the accessibility and control of selected\nstate stability becomes with respect to difficult to obtain behaviors. Examples of the\npotential advantages of simultaneous manipulation of multiple influences have been\n\ndeveloped for affect disorder and anorexia nervosa (Callahan and Sashin, 1987).\n\nAs evidence for the independence of critical behavior from specific history,\nthe qualitatively universal bifurcations along the four canonical routes to chaos\nmanifest dimensionless ratios of parameter and phase space geometries between\nbifurcations. These ratios are quantitatively universal. The formalisms that rescale\nthe distances from fixed points in parameter and observable spaces result in the\n\nsame picture across scale, a dilatational symmetry (also called self similarity or\n\n198\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013698",
