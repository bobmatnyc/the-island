  "text": "Envy emerges out of our sense of fairness, fueled by competition. It is part and parcel ofa\nhierarchical society. When we envy someone, we have detected a difference or inequity between our own\ncondition and that of another. We want what someone else has, presumably because we like what they\nhave. Wanting and liking are in harmony. Recognition of the inequity fuels competition to redress the\nimbalance. This sense of fairness appears early in child development, changing in systematic ways as a\nfunction of a culture’s norms.\n\nThe Swiss economist Ernst Fehr, who led the brain imaging studies of punishment and reward\ndiscussed in Chapter 1, assembled a team of developmental psychologists to test for evidence of fairness\nin young children ages 3-8 years old. Fehr was especially interested in when children recognize a\ndisparity or inequity in the distribution of resources, and what they are willing to do, if anything, to\nredress the imbalance. The experimenter paired up each child with a partner of the same age who was\neither from the same school or a different school; the school distinction was set up to look at in-group\nversus out-group differences which, as discussed in chapter 1, can lead parochial altruism — the\nparadoxical result of greater cooperation among group members and greater hatred and violence toward\nthose outside. Though each child knew about their partner’s age and school affiliation, they never saw\ntheir partner. Each child therefore knew only that they were playing with someone from their school or\nsomeone unfamiliar to them.\n\nEach child played three different games. In each game, the experimenter told one child to decide\nhow to distribute a fixed amount of candy. In the prosocial game, the decider either takes one candy and\ngives one to the partner or takes one candy and gives nothing to the partner. If children are sensitive to\ninequities and want to share in order to make things fair, they should pick the 1-1 option; picking the 1-0\noption doesn’t affect the decider, but dings the partner. In the envy game, the decider has a choice\nbetween 1-1 and 1-2. As in the prosocial game, the decider gets the same amount of candy with both\noptions, but preserves equity with 1-1. Picking 1-1 also reveals that the child has an aversion to others\nhaving more, even when there is no personal cost. In the third, sharing game, the decider has a choice\nbetween 1-1] and 2-0. Here again, the decider gets candy in both cases, but the 2-0 option tempts the\ndesire for more, both personally and relatively. On the one hand, a greedy child will want more candy,\nand so 2 wins over 1. But picking the 2-0 option also leads to a greater difference with the partner, while\nrobbing them of an opportunity for any candy. If fairness prevails, deciders should pick 1-1. If\nselfishness prevails, motivated by competition, they should pick 2-0.\n\nAcross all three games, there was an increasing tendency from age 3 to 8 years old for children to\npick the fair distribution (1-1). Across all ages and games, children were most likely to pick the fair\ndistribution when playing against familiar than unfamiliar schoolmates. What these results reveal,\n\ntogether with many other similar studies, is that children are sensitive to the distribution of goods at an\n\nHauser Chapter 2.
