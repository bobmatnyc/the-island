Charlotte’s Web and CV Sciences, which we would classify\nas finished goods producers, command the highest margins, while Turning Point Brands’\nunique positioning within OTP products generates margins lower than the level that\nwould be seen for traditional cigarette companies. Core cannabis companies have to\ncontend with being both vertically integrated and in many instances, servicing retail\nstores, which are lower margin.\n\nFigure 102 Finished Goods CBD Producers...
