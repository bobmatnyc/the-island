  "text": "depreciation plowback in light of the diminishing returns described by Ricardo,\nMalthus and West two centuries ago. We might crowd our niche, like other\ncreatures, and leave neither consumption safe to spare nor room for capital\naccumulation before diminishing returns set in. But too little investment could seem\na tougher challenge. No thrift at all, meaning not even depreciation plowback, would\nmean no growth at all. Then consumption rate would vary inversely as capital\nacceleration, just as predicted in in thrift theory. And underinvestment, meaning\nplowback of less than current cost depreciation, ought to happen about as often as\noverinvestment. If each year of underinvestment tended to fit the predictions of\nthrift theory even a little, free growth indexes should average something less than\none in the end. But they don’t. The index varies, but averages more than one as often\n\nas less in every country and period.\n\nThe explanation | suggest is already implied in that insight of two centuries ago. Just\nas overinvestment and capital glut diminish returns, underinvestment and capital\nshortage augment them until supply of capital catches up to demand. Even if there\nwere no plowback at all in some years, higher returns to capital already in place\nwould help take up the slack. There would be real danger in sustained\nunderinvestment or overinvestment. The saving grace is in market forces restoring\n\nequilibrium as investors maximize return.\n\nSummary\n\nThis gives the outline of free growth theory. It is my best speculation on how to\nmake sense of the charts and tables. It follows Mill more or less exactly, and risks\n\nthe next step in the bold new direction pointed by Solow.\n\nMy prize exhibits are the charts and tables. Better this book should show them alone,\nwith an explanation of my testing equations and the data sources, than all the rest\nwithout them. They could hardly support free growth theory better than if Mill and I\nhad rigged them. The consequences are huge. We must get rid of the corporate\n\ndouble tax ASAP, and raise the corporate tax rate enough to make the overall\n\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 27\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011018",
