  "text": "When Tom Arnold was a guest on Late Show, David Letterman\npressed him about his friendship with Kathie Lee and Frank Gifford. This\nwas shortly after the G/obe had entrapped and videotaped Gifford’ s\nextramarital tryst with a flight attendant in a hotel room. Letterman\ninsisted, “I don’ t revel in the miseries of others,” but Arnold reminded\nhim of his monologues with jokes about Gifford. Letterman defended\nhimself: “It’ s part of the job.” Arnold stammered, searching for just the\nright words. He finally found them: “Frank Gifford took a bullet for a lot\nof us.” And the audience applauded the accuracy of his assessment.\n\nCertainly, non-celebrities don’ t have to worry about supermarket\ntabloids revealing infidelities to the/r spouses. Such exposure could never\noccur with swinging couples, not only because, as a rule, they are honest\nwith each other, but also because they party with each other, so there are\nno surprises. They are sharing a secret lifestyle, one with an ethic that\ntranscends ordinary romance. Sneaky affairs are for straight people, but\nswingers can eat their wedding cake and have their fantasies too. Which\n\nexplains why there have been no hookers hanging around fh/s convention.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015219",
