  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54033\n\nunfair labor practice charge is filed\nalleging failure to post the notice, “‘the\nRegional Director will make reasonable\nefforts to persuade the respondent\nemployer to post the * * * notice\nexpeditiously,” and that “[i]f the\nemployer does so, the Board expects\nthat there will rarely be a need for\nfurther administrative proceedings.” 75\nFR 80419.\n\nNumerous comments assert that\nfinding the failure to post the notice to\nbe an unfair labor practice is too harsh\na remedy, especially for small\nemployers that are more likely to be\nexcusably unaware of the rule.146 As\njust stated, in practice it should almost\nnever be necessary for proceedings to\nreach that point. For the few employers\nthat may ultimately be found to have\nviolated Section 8(a)(1) by failing to post\nthe notice of employee rights, the only\ncertain consequences will be an order to\ncease and desist and that the notice and\na remedial notice be posted; those\nremedies do not strike the Board as\nsevere.\n\nMichigan Health & Hospital\nAssociation urges that an employer be\nallowed to correct an initial failure to\npost the notice without further\nconsequences; Fireside Distributors, Inc.\nagrees and asks that technical violations\nof the rule not be subject to a finding of\na violation. The Heritage Foundation\nbacks the same approach for inadvertent\nfailures to post. The Board disagrees. To\nrepeat, the Board anticipates that most\nemployers that inadvertently fail to post\nthe notice will do so on being informed\nof the posting requirement, and that in\nthose circumstances further proceedings\nwill rarely be required. However, the\nBoard believes that this matter is best\nhandled through the General Counsel’s\ntraditional exercise of prosecutorial\ndiscretion in accordance with the\ndirections given here.\n\nCalifornia Chamber and NCAE\ncontend that the Board should specify\nthe “‘reasonable efforts’ a Regional\nDirector will make to persuade an\nemployer to post the notice when a\ncharge alleging a failure to post has been\nfiled. They propose that the rule be\namended to state that the Board will\nsend the employer at least two mailed\nletters, with the notice enclosed,\nrequesting that the employer post the\nnotice within a specified period of time,\npreferably 30 days. They also assert that\nthe Board must specify the\ncircumstances in which additional\nproceedings will be appropriate. The\nHeritage Foundation urges that\n§ 104.212(a) be modified to state that if\n\n146 See, e.g., comments of St Mar Enterprises, Inc.\nand National Federation of Independent Business.\n\nan employer promptly posts the notice,\n“there will be no further administrative\nproceedings, unless the Board has\ninformation giving the Board reason to\nbelieve that the preceding failure to do\nso was intentional.” The Board rejects\nthese suggestions because they would\ncreate unnecessary obstacles to effective\nenforcement of the notice requirement.\nThat requirement is straightforward, and\ncompliance should be a simple matter.\nThe Board believes that the General\nCounsel should have discretion to\naddress particular cases of non-\ncompliance efficiently and\nappropriately, depending upon the\ncircumstances.\n\nB, Tolling the Section 10{(b) Statute of\nLimitations\n\nNLRA Section 10(b) provides in part\nthat ‘‘no complaint shall issue based\nupon any unfair labor practice occurring\nmore than six months prior to the filing\nof the charge with the Board|[.]’” 29\nU.S.C. 160(b). However, as the Board\nstated in the NPRM, the 6-month filing\nperiod does not begin to run until the\ncharging party has actual or constructive\nnotice of the allegedly unlawful\nconduct. See, e.g., john Morrell & Co.,\n304 NLRB 896, 899 (1991), review\ndenied 998 F.2d 7 (D.C. Cir. 1993)\n(table). 75 FR 80414. This makes\nintuitive sense, because it would be\nunfair to expect charges to be filed\nbefore the charging party could\nreasonably have known that the law was\nviolated. Similar concerns for fairness\njustify tolling the statute of limitations\nwhere an employee, although aware of\nthe conduct in question, is excusably\nunaware that the conduct is unlawful\nbecause mandatory notice was not given\nto the employee. The Board found that\nwidespread ignorance of NLRA rights\njustified requiring notice to be posted.\nThe Board cited the observation of the\nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Third\nCircuit in a case involving the failure to\npost the notice required under the\nADEA, that “‘[t]he [ADEA] posting\nrequirement was undoubtedly created\nbecause Congress recognized that the\nvery persons protected by the Act might\nbe unaware of its existence.”’ Bonham v.\nDresser Industries, 569 F.2d 187, 193\n(1977), cert. denied 439 U.S. 821 (1978).\nAccordingly, the Board proposed that\ntolling the 10(b) period for filing unfair\nlabor practice charges might be\nappropriate where the required notice\nhas not been posted. 75 FR 80414. For\nthe reasons discussed below, the Board\nacheres to that view.\n\nSection 10(b) is a statute of\nlimitations, and statutes of limitations\nare presumed to include equitable\ntolling whenever the statute is silent or\n\nambiguous on the issue. Irwin v. Dep’t\nVeterans Affairs, 498 U.S. 89, 94-96\n(1990); Zipes v. Trans World Airlines,\nInc., 455 U.S. 385, 392-98 (1982); see\nYoung v. United States, 535 U.S. 43, 49\n(2002) (‘It is hornbook law that\nlimitations periods are customarily\nsubject to equitable tolling, unless\ntolling would be inconsistent with the\ntext of the relevant statute.” (quotations\nand citations omitted)); Hallstrom v.\nTillamook County, 493 U.S. 20, 27\n(1989) (“The running of such statutes is\ntraditionally subject to equitable\ntolling.’’); Honda v. Clark, 386 U.S. 484,\n501 (1967); Glus v. Brooklyn E.D.\nTerminal, 359 U.S. 231, 232-33 (1959)\n(equitable tolling of statutes of\nlimitations is “[d]eeply rooted in our\njurisprudence’); Holmberg v.\nArmbrecht, 327 U.S. 392, 396-97 (1946)\n(equitable tolling is “read into every\nfederal statute of limitation’’).\n\nIn Zipes, the Supreme Court held that\nthe timeliness provision of Title VII’s\ncharge-filing requirement was ‘‘subject\nto waiver, estoppel and equitable\ntolling.” 455 U.S. at 392-98. The\nSupreme Court expressly analogized to\nthe NLRA, and stated that Section10(b)\nwas not jurisdictional: “[T]he time\nrequirement for filing an unfair labor\npractice charge under the National\nLabor Relations Act operates as a statute\nof limitations subject to recognized\nequitable doctrines and not as a\nrestriction of the jurisdiction of the\nNational Labor Relations Board.”’ Id. at\nn.11. Zipes strongly supports the\nproposed rule. The analogy between\nTitle VI and the NLRA is well\nestablished, and neither the holding of\nZipes regarding Title VII nor Zipes’\ncharacterization of 10(b) has ever been\ncalled into doubt.\n\nNotices of employment rights are\nintended, in part, to advise employees\nof the kinds of conduct that may violate\ntheir rights so that they may seek\nappropriate remedies when violations\noccur. Failure to post required notices\ndeprives employees of both the\nknowledge of their rights and of the\navailability of avenues of redress.\nAccordingly, a substantial majority of\nthe courts of appeals—including the\nFirst, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth,\nSeventh, Eighth, and Eleventh\nCircuits—have adopted the doctrine that\nthe failure to post required employment\nlaw notices may result in equitable\ntolling of the statute of limitations.\nMercado v.
