The exceptionally\nsuccessful ethnic Indian community in the United States will provide\nbridges with India. And all this cooperation will accentuate the process of\ncivilizational fusion.\n\nIn contrast to China and India, Russia has held back from thoroughly\nembracing modernity, even though the Soviet Union started modernizing\nbefore China and India. Russia hesitated to join the World Trade\nOrganization and has not yet accepted that ungrudging participation in the\ncurrent rules-based order can facilitate its own progress. The more Beijing\nand New Delhi prosper, however, the more persuasive will be the case for\nMoscow to follow their lead.\n\nAs it works closely with the major developing powers, the West should also\nstep up its efforts to construct a robust rules-based world in general. In\n2003, former U.S. President Bill Clinton said that Americans should try \"to\ncreate a world with rules and partnerships and habits of behavior that we\nwould like to live in when we're no longer the military, political, economic\nsuperpower in the world.\" If Clinton's fellow citizens could accept such\nadvice, the citizens of most other countries would be willing to do the same.\nAnd this might be easier to achieve than many believe.\n\nMuch of today's global multilateral architecture was a valuable gift from the\nWest to the world. Yet the major Western powers have also made sure that\nthese institutions have never grown strong enough or independent enough\nto make real trouble for their creators. UN secretary-generals have been\ncreatures of the permanent members of the Security Council, the leaders of\nthe World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been drawn\nexclusively from the United States and Europe, and dominance in these\nfinancial institutions has occasionally been exploited to achieve extra-\nfinancial goals. These policies should be reconsidered, for the legitimacy of\nthe system depends on the perception that its rules are developed by and\napplied fairly and equally to all, rather than that they cater to the narrow\ninterests of a few. Picking strong leaders for the major international\ninstitutions and keeping those institutions’ operations from being\nundermined or politicized would be a major step forward.\n\nWestern policymakers, finally, should work to highlight the good things that\nare happening around the world rather than harp on the bad things.\nHundreds of millions of people have emerged from poverty in recent\ndecades even as military conflicts have decreased. The convergence of global\naspirations means that a vast majority of countries want to see evolution\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026846",
