She told me that she\nhad to “empty out my personal sex manual” to feel the cravings of her clients. What\nthe john most wanted appeared suddenly in her mind in the form of a cartoon. A\nuniversity criminologist later explained that the word “griv” was probably derived\nfrom what pick pockets call grift sense, the ability to intuit who was likely to have\nenough money in their billfold to justify the risk, even if they appeared in the worn\nclothes and dated cars of old money.\n\nIn his 1913 Dernieres Penses, Henri Poincare’, France’s seminal theorist in\nnonlinear dynamical systems theory, described intuition as a mental faculty which\nallows us to “...immediately see the end from afar...” In the context of mathematical\nepistemology, the instantaneous images of a geometer contrast with the labored\nsequential logic of the mathematical analyst. Poincare’ claimed that inclinations\ntoward one or the other of these two cognitive styles and their associated\nmathematical tools arise from different kinds of minds. He contrasted the 19\"\nCentury German mathematicians, Weierstrass, who he said reduced his general\n\ntt\n\ntheory of functions to “...a prolongation of arithmetic...without a single (pictorial)\n\nn\n\nfigure in any of his books...” with Riemann who called geometry to his aid in\ndescribing functions. He created “...an image that no one can forget... once he\nunderstood it.”\n\nExperiencing the behavior of others, we create a set of anticipations about\nwhom and how they are that align with parts of ourselves. Aware of one aspect of a\nperson, we imagine the others. With a small amount of initial information, we\nconnect the dots, fitting features we have seen and heard to personality\nconfigurations stored by informal category in our brain files. Our conclusions about\nthem “being one of those” can both facilitate and impair our perceptions. Eastern\nmetaphysicians, Western mystical religionists, socially liberal secular humanists,\nShannon information theorists and today’s students of dynamical systems in brain\nand behavior can, in different ways, make the case that the content of these\nstereotypes reflect a pattern of constraints, our personal limitations resulting from\n\nthe rutted roads of worldly experiences.
