Consensus underestimating GDP and inflation poral
We are upbeat on Japan’s outlook and think consensus is underestimating the strength

of medium-term GDP and inflation. We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in
CY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8% growth next year. For the first time in four
years both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The combination of
modestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should
drive Japan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the
Bo) to keep its rate targets unchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in
the right direction.

Fiscal and monetary policy realigning

For years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese
policymakers now seem to be on the same page and we see little risk of another policy

error. If anything, we see upside risks from greater fiscal stimulus via a third Izumi Devalier

increasingly stimulatory as inflation rises.

2017 - a year of recovering domestic demand

We think the economy is heading towards a cyclical sweet spot and see a broad-based
recovery in domestic demand. Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the
saving rate peaks; 2) capex should accelerate in response to the improving demand
outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and “low-for-longer” real rates; and 3}
increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up the
velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.

Biggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty
External developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US
policy uncertainty. The downside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US
protectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger yen, which could reduce 2017 growth
to zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to achieve greater
military self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to
deepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.
