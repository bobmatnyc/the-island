President-elect Trump may\nfind himself somewhat at odds on his trade agenda with\nSenate Finance Committee Chairman Hatch who has\nsupported numeroustrade agreements during his\ncongressional tenure.\n\nHouse Ways and Means Committee. House Republican\ntrade leaders —including Speaker Ryan and Ways and\nMeans Chairman Brady —played a pivotal role in\nadvancing President Obama’s trade initiativesthrough\nCongress, including passage of Trade Promotion\nAuthority (TPA) in 2015. A key question is how closely\nthey will work to support President-elect Trump’s trade\nrestrictionist agenda.\n\nTrans-Pacific Partnership Agreement. Unless TPP can\nbe approved in the 2016 lame-duck session (an extremely\nunlikely prospect, as discussed above), TPP will not be\nratified.\n\nTransatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership\nAgreement. US and EU trade negotiators failed to make\nmuch meaningful progress on TTIPin 2016. Prospects for\nTTIP are dim, given the President-elect’s trade priorities\nand a potential chillin US-EU relations.\n\nOther trade agreements? The Trade Promotion\nAuthority, enacted in 2015, provides enhanced fast-track\nprocedures for trade agreementsreached before July 1,\n2018, with a possible extension to July 1, 2021. Will\nPresident-elect Trump decide to launch additional trade\nagreements that could be considered under the fast-track\nauthority in Congress? Following the U.K. vote on Brexit\nthis summer, some Members of Congress expressed an\ninterest in a possible US-U.K. free trade agreement.\n\nEY 23 | Election 2016\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022395",
