  "text": "Life Among the Neo-Pagans\n\nIn the summer of 1997, | performed at the 17th annual Starwood\n\nNeo-Pagan Festival in Sherman, New York—Amish country on the border\nnear Ohio and Pennsylvania. This event—a female-oriented celebration of\nthe sensual and the spiritual—took place on private campgrounds, where\nclothing was optional. Many women were bare-breasted, and several men\nand women walked around fully naked, a practice known as the “sky\nclad” experience.\n\nInstead of camping out, | stayed at a nearby bed-and-breakfast\nplace. Downstairs in the living room, | asked a woman—falsely assuming\nthat she was the proprietor—where the key would be left if | came back\nlate at night.\n\n“|don’ t know,” she replied. “I’ m here for the festival.”\n“Oh. In what capacity?”\n\n“I’m in the craft.”\n\n“Which craft?”\n\n“That’ s right,” she said.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015220",
