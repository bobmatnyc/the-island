(AP)\n\nBuckingham Palace officials have again denied claims made by a woman who alleged that she was forced to have\nsex while underage with Prince Andrew, Duke of York.\n\nThe second denial comes after two Sunday papers in Britain published interviews with the woman in which she\nclaimed that she was forced by American financier Jeffrey Epstein to have sex with Prince Andrew at least three\ntimes between 1999 and 2002. The woman alleges that the encounters took place in London, New York, and on a\nCaribbean island owned by Epstein.\n\nA Palace spokesman has said that the allegations are \"false and without any foundation.\"\n\n\"It is emphatically denied that the Duke of York had any form of sexual contact or relationship with (the woman),\" the\nstatement continued. The denials are unusual because royal officials typically do not comment on allegations\nagainst members of the royal family.\n\nThe woman's claims are part of a lawsuit in a Florida court relating to how prosecutors handled a sexual abuse case\nagainst American financier Jeffrey Epstein. The woman, identified in court papers only as \"Jane Doe No. 3,\" is one\nof two new accusers asking a West Palm Beach, Florida, judge to allow them to join the existing lawsuit against\nEpstein. The royal is not named as a defendant in the case, and no criminal charges or formal allegations have\nbeen made against him.\n\n1/2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014821",
