After several emails back and forth in the morning, he wrote \nto say he was packed and ready to leave the house but he had been fighting a stomach bug, so he had \ndecided it was best to postpone and go to bed. He was fine at 6pm when his wife (a mass General health \nprofessional) came home. She brought him a coke, went downstairs to make dinner. Half an hour later she \nwent upstairs to check on him. He had died. We got the news at 9pm on a phone call from someone we hadn't \ntalked to in 20 years\" \"Jonathan Matson has died\" was impossible to process. Katinka is still was \ndistraught and, just coming out of shock. \n--And...this, from my older brother Philip (\"Distinguished NASA Physcist\" awardee), who had prostate \nsurgery about 25 years, and got lucky be living in Raliegh-Durham, near Duke medical center which is \ntops. They've kept him alive and it's finally caught up to him: \n\"1 have run out of standard treatments. chemo is getting less effective with increasing side effects. \nThere is a new drug Keytruda it has been approved for some cancers but is still experimental for prostate \ncancer. \nhttps://prostatecancernewstoday.com/pembrolizumab-immune-therapy-help-men-prostate-cancer/. I have been \napproved to get Keytruda and will start on Thursday.\" \n--Finally, did I ever tell you about the Biosphere crowd? Absolutely nutty cult I represented in the \nearly 90s. (Although individually the people were sometimes fun). My friend Roy walford, the doctor \ninside the Biosphere, eventually died because of a condition he developed while inside. I kept sending \nwriters down there to work with them and they would inevitably sneak away in the dead of night. I had to \nsell their book three times, each time for a fractions of the previous advance which started in 7 \nfigures. Turns out Bannon took over as CEO of the place in 1993 so we may have overlapped. See: \nSteve Bannon Was Once Hired to manage an Artificial World of People Living Under Glass (Before the Trump \ncampaign)-\nhttp://slate.me/2kesDun \nIn the office this afternoon and after 10:30am tomorrow. \n1111111111111mobile \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030430",
