For example:\n\n—I believe the majority of employees know\nabout labor unions and how to form a\nunion, and this poster is unnecessary.*9\n\n—IIlt is hard to imagine that there are many\nin the US who do not know that they can\ntry to join a union.\n\n—The fact of the matter is that if a group of\nemployees are upset enough with their\ncurrent management that they feel they\nneed union representation, they already\nknow what they need to do as a recourse.\nAnd if they do not immediately know how\nto respond, there are plenty of resources for\nthem.5°\n\n—We, the employees, know the unions exist,\n* * * Ifthe employees want to know about\nunions, they should research it themselves.\nIt is not as though the information is not\nreadily available.\n\nSome posit that comparatively few\nprivate sector employees are\nrepresented by unions not because\nemployees do not know that they can\njoin unions, but because they have\nconsciously rejected union\nrepresentation for any number of\nreasons (e.g., they do not believe that\nunions can help them; they do not want\nto pay union dues; they deem union\nrepresentation unnecessary in light of\nother workplace protection statutes). For\nexample:\n\n—lIs it not just as probable that people clearly\nunderstand unions, and they have decided\nthey want no part of them?\n\n—Labor unions charge approximately 1.3%\nof pre-tax earnings for monthly dues. Many\nworkers, especially those who lost their\ngood paying jobs during this recession and\nhave found new jobs at $10.00-$11.00 per\nhour wages, need the dues money\nthemselves, in order to support their\nfamilies.\n\n49 Comment of the Employers Association.\n5° Comment of Malt-O-Meal Company (Malt-O-\nMeal).\n\n—Membership is down because so many of\nthe good things unions fought for a long\ntime ago have been legislated, at either the\nFederal or State level, and so the need for\nunions has declined.51\n\n—I[Mlost employees are very aware of their\nrights to unionize and many employees\nchoose not to do so because of the rights\nthey already have under our federal and\nstate laws.\n\n—In fact, one could say that the NLRA and\nother employment laws have succeeded to\nthe degree that unions are NOT necessary\nin today’s work environment.®2\n\nA few comments question the Board’s\nbelief that immigrant workers are\nunfamiliar with their workplace\nrights.>? Several comments argue that\nthe NLRA has been in effect for nearly\n76 years, which is sufficient time for\nemployees to learn about its\nprovisions.>4\n\nA number of comments argue that the\nstudies cited in the NPRM are from the\nlate 1980s and early 1990s and are\ntherefore out of date >> (and also, some\nsay, poorly supported).5® Moreover,\nthose studies, whatever their value\nwhen published, predate the wide use\nof the internet. Now there are many\nonline sources of information\nconcerning unions and union\norganizing, including the Board’s own\nWeb site. According to these comments,\nit should not be necessary to require\nemployers to post notices of NLRA\nrights because employees who are\ninterested in learning about unions can\nquickly and easily find such\ninformation online.>”? One comment,\nlike some others, argues that “If it is so\nimportant that employees know their\nrights under the NLRB it should be the\ngovernment or union whose\nresponsibility it is to inform them.’’ 58\nTwo comments suggest that the Board\nconduct a mass media informational\ncampaign to that end, and one notes that\nthe Board has in fact recently increased\n\n51 Comment of Tecton Products.\n\n52 Comment of Printing and Imaging Association\nof MidAmerica (Printing and Imaging Ass’n).\n\n53 See, e.g., comment of the Printing and Imaging\nAss'n.\n\n54 See, e.g., comment of Coalition for a\nDemocratic Workplace.\n\n55 See, e.g., comments of Printing Industries of\nAmerica and the Portland Cement Association.\n\n56 See, e.g., comments of Cass County Electric\nCooperative and Pilchak Cohen & Tice, P.C.\n\n57 As one person states, ‘The internet has long\nago replaced lunch room bulletin board postings as\nthe means by which employees learn of and\nexercise their rights.”’\n\n58 Such comments appear to misunderstand that\nby this rule, the Board is indeed seeking to inform\nemployees of the provisions of the NLRA, using the\nmost accessible venues to reach them, their\nworkplaces.\n\nOther comments question why this rule does not\nmandate notice posting by governmental employers.\nThe NLRA does not cover such employers. See\nSection 2(2), 29 U.S.C. 152(2).\n\nits public information efforts.59 One\n\ncomment urges the Board to conduct a\n\nstudy to ascertain current employees’\n\nlevel of NLRA knowledge before\nimposing a notice posting requirement.\n\nIn contrast, as discussed in more\ndetail below, numerous comments from\nindividuals, union organizers, attorneys\nrepresenting unions, and worker\nassistance organizations agree with the\nBoard that most employees are\nunfamiliar with their NLRA rights.\nImmigrant rights organizations state that\nimmigrant workers largely do not know\nabout their rights.\n\nAfter careful consideration of the\ncomments on both sides of this issue,\nthe Board believes that many employees\nare unaware of their NLRA rights and\nthat a notice posting requirement is a\nreasonable means of promoting greater\nknowledge among employees. To the\nextent that employees’ general level of\nknowledge is uncertain, the Board\nbelieves that the potential benefit of a\nnotice posting requirement outweighs\nthe modest cost to employers. Certainly,\nthe Board has been presented with no\nevidence persuasively demonstrating\nthat knowledge of NLRA rights is\nwidespread among employees.\n\nThe comments asserting that the right\nto join a union is widely known cite\nlittle, if any, support for that assertion.\nBy contrast, many of the comments\ncontending that employees are\nunfamiliar with their NLRA rights base\ntheir statements on personal experience\nor on extensive experience representing\nor otherwise assisting employees. Many\nindividual workers, commenting on the\nrule, indicate their personal experiences\nwith the lack of NLRA knowledge and\nconcurrent strong support for the rule.\nFor example:\n\n—Even though most of my coworkers and\nsupervisors were highly intelligent people,\nit is my experience that most workers are\nalmost totally unaware of their rights under\nthe NLRA.\n\n—Knowing that there is a federal agency out\nthere that will protect the rights of working\npeople to organize is essential to the\nexercise of those rights.\n\n—TI had no idea that I had the right to join\na union, and was often told by my\nemployer that I could not do so.* * *I\nthink employers should be required to post\nnotices so that all employees may make an\ninformed decision about their rights to join\na union.6°\n\n—Workers have rights and they have the\nright to know them.®?\n\n—[Tlhere is a lot of ignorance among young\nworkers and veteran workers alike with\nregard to knowledge of their right to\n\n59 Comment of Fisher & Phillips, LLP.\n\n60 Comment of Member, Local 150, Operating\nEngineers.\n\n61 Comment of Organizer, IBEW.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022286",
