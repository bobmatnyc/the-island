In his five weeks at this Booz Allen\njob, he also used this same newly-acquired “Priv Ac” at the NSA to steal files from the Israeli,\nCanadian and Australian intelligence services.\n\nJumping from one outside contracting firm to another for the purpose of penetrating other/r\nwestern intelligence services is not the conventional mission of a whistle-blowing. In the parlance\nof intelligence operations, an employee of an intelligence service who changes his jobs\\ solely to\nsteal the more valuable secrets of services is called an “expanding penetration.”\n\nIt is not possible to believe that Snowden did not know the damage that the highly-sensitive\ndocuments he was taking from the NSA and its allies. Even if they did not reveal any unlawful\nAmerican activities, could do immense damage to Western intelligence. Indeed, he said as much\nonce he got to Moscow. In respect to China alone, he told James Risen, the New York Times’\nnational security reporter, in October 2013 that he had had “access to every [NSA] target, every\n[NSA] active operation” that could turn out the NSA’s “lights” in China. He no doubt assumed\nthat he had the same power to close down the NSA’s operations in Russia.\n\nHis choice to switch jobs did not come out of the blue. It was not based on serendipitously\ndiscovering the documents after he began working at Booz Allen. . It was a carefully calculated\nmove. As he told Lana Lam, he knew in advance that by switching to the job at Booz Allen he\nwould gain the opportunity to take the lists of NSA sources. He knew that the NSA’ secretive\nNational Threat Operations Center’s chief business was, as its name suggests, countering direct\nthreats from China, Russia and other adversary states, and that, to deal with these threats, the\nNSA had used sophisticated methods to hack into the computers of adversaries. The NSA was\neven able to remotely gain entry to adversary computers that were not hooked into a network.\n“Tt’s no secret that we hack China very aggressively,” Snowden later said from Moscow. He had\na planned target: getting the lists of the enemy computers that the NSA hacked into.\n\nHe also knew he was undertaking s a dangerous enterprise. He would tell Poitras in Hong\nKong that the NSA would literally “kill” to protect their secrets. He also said he could be seized\nin a rendition operation by the CIA in Hong Kong. He even foresaw the probability that he “would\nbe in an orange jumpsuit, super-max prison in isolation or Guantanamo.”\n\nHe knowingly chose this course, despite the possibility of assassination or imprisonment,\npresumably because he believed the value of the secrets he would obtain by switching jobs\noutweighed the risk of imprisonment. Part of his calculus might have been the belief that the NSA\nlists, GCHQ documents and other material in his possession could give him great leverage, if he\nchose to exert it, in his future dealings with intelligence services (including the NSA.) If so, his\nchoice to widen his access was also a choice to empower himself.\n\nThe second choice of consequence that Snowden made was to make Hong Kong his first\nstop. He had many other options. He could have remained in America, as almost all previous\nwhistle-blowers in the past had chosen to do. If he did that, he would have to make his case in\ncourt (and, in that case, the level 3 documents he took might have been retrieved before they fell\ninto unauthorized hands.) He could have also chosen to make a cross-border escape to a country\nthat did not have an active extradition treaty with the United States. He could have, for example,\ntaken a direct flight to Brazil, which has no extradition treaty with the United States. Brazil also\nhad the advantage of being the home country of Glenn Greenwald, the journalist who he wanted\nto break the whistle-blowing story. As Greenwald seemed (at least to Snowden) hesitant to travel\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020364",
