  "text": "54044\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nwill not have a significant economic\nimpact on a substantial number of small\nentities. 5 U.S.C. 605(b) (emphasis\nadded). The Board understands the\n“economic impact of * * * the rule’ to\nrefer to the costs to affected entities of\ncomplying with the rule, not to the\neconomic impact of a series of\nsubsequent decisions made by\nindividual actors in the economy that\nare neither compelled by, nor the\ninevitable result of, the rule.197 Even if\nmore employees opt for union\nrepresentation after learning about their\nrights, employers can avoid the adverse\neffects on business costs, flexibility, and\nprofitability predicted by Baker &\nDaniels LLP and other commenters by\nnot agreeing to unions’ demands that\nmight produce those effects.198\n\nThe Board finds support for this view\nin the language of Section 603 of the\nRFA, which lists the items to be\nincluded in an initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis if one is required. 5\nU.S.C. 603. Section 603(a) states only\nthat such analysis ‘‘shall describe the\nimpact of the proposed rule on small\nentities.” 5 U.S.C. 603(a). However,\nSection 603(b) provides, as relevant\nhere, that “[e]ach initial regulatory\nflexibility analysis * * * shall\ncontain—* * *\n\n“(4) a description of the projected\nreporting, recordkeeping and other\ncompliance requirements of the\nproposed rule, including an estimate of\nthe classes of small entities which will\nbe subject to the requirement and the\ntype of professional skills necessary for\npreparation of the report or record|[.]”’ 5\nU.S.C. 603(b)(4) (emphasis added). The\nSmall Business Administration cites, as\nexamples of “other compliance\nrequirements,”\n\n(a) Capital costs for equipment needed to\nmeet the regulatory requirements; (b) costs of\nmodifying existing processes and procedures\nto comply with the proposed rule; (c) lost\nsales and profits resulting from the proposed\nrule; (d) changes in market competition as a\nresult of the proposed rule and its impact on\nsmall entities or specific submarkets of small\nentities; (e) extra costs associated with the\npayment of taxes or fees associated with the\nproposed rule; and (f) hiring employees\ndedicated to compliance with regulatory\nrequirements.199\n\nThus, the “impact” on small entities\nreferred to in Section 603(a) refers only\n\n197 For RFA purposes, the relevant economic\nimpact on small entities is the impact of\ncompliance with the rule. Mid-Tex Electric\nCooperative, Inc. v. FERC, 773 F.2d 327, 342 (D.C.\nCir. 1985), cited in SBA Guide, above, at 77.\n\n198 NLRA Section 8(d) expressly states that the\nobligation to bargain in good faith “does not compel\neither party to agree to a proposal or require the\nmaking of a concession|[.]” 29 U.S.C. 158(d).\n\n199 SBA Guide, above, at 34.\n\nto the rule’s projected compliance costs\nto small entities (none of which would\nresult from posting a workplace notice),\nnot the kinds of speculative and indirect\neconomic impact that Baker & Daniels\nLLC invokes,?°°\n\nAssociated Builders and Contractors,\nInc. (ABC) and Retail Industry Leaders\nAssociation (RILA) contend that the\nBoard’s RFA analysis fails to account for\nthe costs of electronic notice posting,\nespecially for employers that\ncommunicate with employees via\nmultiple electronic means. Both\ncomments deplore what they consider\nto be the rule’s vague requirements in\nthis respect. ABC argues that clear\nguidance is needed, and that the Board\nshould withdraw the electronic notice\nposting requirements until more\ninformation can be gathered. RILA\nasserts that ‘“‘[d]eciphering and\ncomplying with the Board’s\nrequirements would impose significant\nlegal and administrative costs and\ninevitably result [in] litigation as parties\ndisagree about when a communication\nis ‘customarily used,’ and whether and\nwhen employees need to be informed\nthrough multiple communications.”\n\nNumerous comments assert that\nemployers, especially small employers\nthat lack professional human resources\nstaff, will incur significant legal\nexpenses as they attempt to comply\nwith the rule. For example, Fisher and\nPhillips, a management law firm, urges\nthat the cost of legal fees should be\nincluded in assessing the economic\nimpact of the proposed rule: “[I]t might\nbe considered naive to assume that a\nsignificant percentage of small\nemployers would not seek the advice of\ncounsel, and it would be equally naive\nto assume that a significant percentage\nof those newly-engaged lawyers could\nbe retained for as little as $31.02/hour.”’\n\nThose comments are not persuasive.\nThe choice to retain counsel is not a\nrequirement for complying with the\nrule. This is not a complicated or\nnuanced rule. The employer is only\nrequired to post a notice provided by\nthe Board in the same manner in which\nthat employer customarily posts notices\nto its employees. The Board has\nexplained above what the rule’s\nelectronic posting provisions require of\nemployers in general, and it has\nsimplified those provisions by\neliminating the requirement that notices\nbe provided by email and many other\nforms of electronic communication.?°! It\n\n200 Baker & Daniels LLP cites no authority to\nsupport its contention that the RFA is concerned\nwith costs other than the costs of compliance with\nthe rule, and the Board is aware of none.\n\n201 Contrary to ABC’s and RILA’s assertions, the\nBoard did estimate the cost of complying with the\n\nshould not be necessary for employers,\nsmall or large, to add human resources\nstaff, retain counsel, or resort to\nlitigation if they have questions\nconcerning whether the proposed rule\napplies to them or about the\nrequirements for technical compliance\nwith the rule, including how the\nelectronic posting provisions\nspecifically affect their enterprises.2°?\nSuch questions can be directed to the\nBoard’s regional offices, either by\ntelephone, personal visit, email, or\nregular mail, and will be answered free\nof charge by representatives of the\nBoard.293\n\nCass County Electric Cooperative\nargues that the Board failed to take into\naccount legal expenses that employers\nwill incur if they fail to ‘follow the\nletter of the proposed rule.” The\ncomment urges that the Board should\nestimate the cost to businesses ‘‘should\nthey have to defend themselves against\nan unfair labor practice for failure to\ncomply with the rule, no matter what\nthe circumstances for that failure might\nbe,’ presumably including failures to\npost the notice by employers that are\nunaware of the rule and inadvertent\nfailures to comply with technical\nposting requirements. International\nFoodservice Distributors Association\ncontends that the Board also should\nhave considered the costs of tolling the\nstatute of limitations when employers\nfail to post the notice. However, the\ncosts referred to in these comments are\ncosts of not complying with the rule, not\ncompliance costs. As stated above, for\nRFA purposes, the relevant economic\nanalysis focuses on the costs of\ncomplying with the rule.2°\n\nrule’s electronic notice posting requirements; its\nestimated average cost of $62.04 specifically\nincluded such costs. 75 FR 80415. Although ABC\nfaults the Board for failing to issue a preliminary\nrequest for information (RFI) concerning the ways\nemployers communicate with employees\nelectronically, the Board did ask for comments\nconcerning its RFA certification in the NPRM, id.\nat 80416. In this regard, ABC states only that “many\nABC member companies communicate with\nemployees through email or other electronic\nmeans,” which the Board expressly contemplated\nin the NPRM, id. at 80413, and which is also the\nBoard’s practice with respect to communicating\nwith its own employees. If ABC has more specific\ninformation it has failed to provide it. In any event,\nhe final rule will not require email or many other\nypes of electronic notice.\n\n202 Association of Corporate Counsel contends\nhat employers will have to modify their policies\nand procedures manuals as a result of the rule. The\nBoard questions that contention, but even if some\nemployers do take those steps, they would not be\na cost of complying with the rule.\n\n203 Fisher and Phillips also suggest that the Board\nailed to take into account the effect that the\nproposed rule would have on the Board’s own case\nintake and budget. The RFA, however, does not\nrequire an estimate of the economic effects of\nproposed rules on Federal agencies.\n\n204 See fn. 197, above.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022315",
