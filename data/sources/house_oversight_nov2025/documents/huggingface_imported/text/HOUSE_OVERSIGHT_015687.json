  "text": "Preface X1il\nBeliefs\n\ne We have true free will. We consciously decide our actions and\nthese decisions are in no way predetermined. We shape the\nfuture. Allowing for free will is, therefore, a boundary condition\nfor any theory of our Universe.\n\n* The world is an amazing place, but understandable. We can\nunderstand the Universe through the application of thought and\nreason.\n\n* ‘There is only one Universe and it appears to make sense.\n\n* Humans think creatively, computers do not.\n\n* ‘The process of understanding and communication is complex,\nmuch more complex than the digital theorems of Claude\nShannon and Harry Nyquist.\n\n« Understanding is hard.\n\n« The communication of understanding is even harder.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015687",
