Since the\npresidential election, the ’trump tax rally’ that has arguably lifted the broader S&P500\non the expectation of lower corporate taxes has left most US oils lagging given the\nabsence of any benefit from lower taxes. For Hess, we believe the catalysts are still\nahead while the relative performance hurdle associated with the election has passed.\nFor this reason, Hess replaces DVN as our energy stock on the BofAML US1 list.\n\nEarnings updates\nMarking to market for 1Q17 we update earnings as follows:\n\nTable 4: HES Earnings Estimates\n\nQi Q2 Q3 Q4 FY BBG Consensus\n\n2015A (0.98) (0.52) (1.03) (1.40) (3.92) (3.92)\n2016E (1.72) (1.11) (1.12) (1.01) (4.94) (4.98)\nPrevious (1.72) (1.11) (1.12) (1.01) (4.94) nla\n\n2017E (1.21) (1.19) (0.72) (0.63) (3.75) (3.03)\nPrevious (1.37) (1.19) (0.72) (0.63) (3.91) nla\n\n2018E (0.40) (0.40) (0.35) (0.30) (1.46) (2.09)\nPrevious (0.40) (0.41) (0.35) (0.31) (1.47) nla\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nBankof America <>\nMerrill Lynch Hess Corp. | 11 April 2017 9\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014881",
