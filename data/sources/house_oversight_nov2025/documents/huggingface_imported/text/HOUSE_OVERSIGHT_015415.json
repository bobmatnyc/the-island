  "text": "And “Don’ t drop the soap” even made its way to the animated Family\n\nGuy.\n\nMeanwhile, reacting to the Tosh tirade, Julie Burton, president of the\nWomen’ s Media Center, stated: “If free speech permits a comedian to\nsuggest a woman in his audience should be gang-raped, then it certainly\npermits us to object, and to ask what message this sends to survivors or to\nperpetuators. Tosh’ s comment was just one extreme example of pop\nculture’ s dismissive treatment of sexualized violence, which desensitizes\naudiences to enormous human suffering. Internet outcry is encouraging,\n\nbut popular media needs to push back too.”\n\nAnd the original blogger posted another message:\n\n“My friend and | wanted to thank everyone for there /s/c/ support\nand for getting this story out there. We just wanted everyone to know\nwhat Daniel Tosh had done and if you didn’ t agree then to stop\nfollowing him. My friend is surprised to have gotten any form of an\napology and doesn’ t wish to press any further charges against [him].”\nWhat? Press charges? Rape is a crime. Rape jokes aren’ t. They are the risk\nof free speech. The blog concluded, “She does plan on returning to\ncomedy shows in the future, but to see comedians that she’ s seen before\n\nor to at least look up artists before going to their shows.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015415",
