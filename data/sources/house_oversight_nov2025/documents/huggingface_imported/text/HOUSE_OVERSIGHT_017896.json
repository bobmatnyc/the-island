  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n831\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\ncomplaints presently before the Court do\nnot allege or identify a duty owed to Plain-\ntiffs by moving Defendants. See Burnett\n[, 274 F.Supp.2d at 108-09. Accordingly,\nthe negligence and negligent infliction of\nemotional distress claims are dismissed for\nfailure to state a claim.\n\nB. Analysis of Claims Against the\nMoving Defendants\n\n[93] While applying the liberal notice\npleading requirements of Rule 8, the Court\nnotes that in light of “the extreme nature\nof the charge of terrorism, fairness re-\nquires extra-careful scrutiny of Plaintiffs’\nallegations as to any particular defendant,\nto ensure that he-or it-does indeed have\nfair notice of [the claims].” Jd. at 103-04.\n\n1. Al Rajhi Bank\n\n[94] Al Rajhi Bank was founded in\n1987 and now has a network of nearly 400\nbranch offices throughout Saudi Arabia\nand seventeen worldwide subsidiaries.\nBurnett Complaint 184. All the banking\nDefendants are alleged to have “provided\nessential support to the al Qaeda organiza-\ntion and operations. The banking Defen-\ndants in this lawsuit have acted as instru-\nments of terror, in raising, facilitating and\ntransferring money to terrorist organiza-\ntions.” Burnett Complaint 146. Plaintiffs\nclaim that Al Rajhi Bank is “the primary\nbank for a number of charities that serve\nas al Qaeda front groups,” including Al\nHaramain, MWL, WAMY, SJRC, and\nIIRO. Burnett Complaint 185; Rule 12(e)\nStatement 131. “Al Rajhi continues to\nmaintain Al Haramain’s accounts despite\nAl Haramain’s designation on March 11,\n2002 as terrorist organizations by both the\nUnited States and Saudi Arabian authori-\nties.” Rule 12(e) Statement 144. The\nBurnett Plaintiffs claim Al Rajhi Bank\nknew or had to know that its depositors,\nDefendant charities WAMY, MWL, IIRC,\n\nand SJRC were material supporters of\nterrorism. Rule 12(e) Statement 11 44-60.\n\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs claim that Saudi\nArabia has “ineffective and/or rudimentary\nbank supervisory, anti-money laundering\nlaws and anti-terrorist financing in place.”\nRule 12(e) Statement 1972-78. In 1999,\nWilliam Weschler of the National Security\nCouncil and Richard Newcomb of the Of-\nfice of Foreign Assets Control traveled to\nSaudi Arabia to warn Al Rajhi Bank and\nits regulator, the Saudi Arabian Monetary\nAgency (“SAMA”), “that their financial\nsystems were being manipulated or uti-\nlized to fund terrorist organizations such\nas Al Qaeda.” Jd. 175. The United\nStates encouraged SAMA to adopt “know\nyour customer” rules. Jd. “Despite these\nwarnings, Al Rajhi failed to adopt even the\nmost minimal standards, [which] resulted\nin the use of Al Rajhi as an instrument of\nterror and a material supporter, aider and\nabettor of al Qaeda and international ter-\nrorist activities.” Jd. 19 76-77.\n\nOne of the hijackers on board American\nAirlines Flight 11, Abdulaziz al-Omari,\nheld an account at Al Rajhi Bank. Burnett\nComplaint 185; Rule 12(e) Statement 1 43.\nAnother hijacker, Mohammed Atta, made\na transfer to this account at some time.\nRule 12(e) Statement 143. Plaintiffs claim\nal Qaeda financier Zouaydi asked Abdullah\nbin Abdul Muhsen al Turki, a counselor to\nthe government of Saudi Arabia, to send\nmoney through Al Rajhi. Burnett Com-\nplaint 19 388, 538.\n\nThe Burnett Plaintiffs also claim that Al\nRajhi Bank has relationships with Hamas\nand other terrorists. Rule 12(e) State-\nment 1961-69. Al Rajhi Bank chose Tex-\nas-based Infocom to host its website. Jd.\n1165, 66.
