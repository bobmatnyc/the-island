  "text": "44 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nthese simple building blocks the computer allows us to play computer\ngames or process the words of this book as I write. Importantly, all these\noperations are deterministic; given a set of inputs the computer will\nalways generate the same outputs and that means a computer has no free\nwill.\n\n“Ah,” I hear you say, “but my computer plays games with me and is\nnot predictable, otherwise I would always beat it” You are right, but the\ncomputer has a clever trick to fake non-deterministic behavior: it uses\nyou!\n\nComputers on their own cannot generate random numbers. All\na computer can do is generate a pseudo-random number and it does\nthis by working its way through a very long calculation. It could, for\nexample, calculate the first thousand digits of 1 (pi), and then start using\nthe subsequent digits as random numbers. The digits look jumbled up\nbut we know they follow an entirely predictable pattern. The computer\nappears to behave randomly because when I press the button to kill\nan alien the computer picks the number it had counted up to at that\nmoment, say the 55,678\" digit of 1, and uses that. It is I, the human, who\nunconsciously picks the precise moment in time and therefore provides\nthe random element. My choice is governed by all sorts of extraneous\nquantum influences: Did I have coffee this morning? Was it a big mug\nor a small cup? How hot was it? All these things will be important as\nthey determine the amount of caffeine absorbed across the brain blood\nbarrier and the exact timing of my actions.\n\nHumans are not good at consciously generating random numbers.\nWe tend to choose the same numbers too often. If I ask you to pick a\nnumber between one and ten, you are likely to choose three or seven.\nThis effect is called social stereotyping; magicians often use it when they\npretend to read your mind. The problem arises because we tend to over\nthink the problem. I asked you to pick a random number between one\nand ten. You won't pick one or ten. Five is too obviously the mid-point.\nEven numbers don’t feel random. Nine is too large. That just leaves three\nand seven. So the mind reading magician has you! Humans can unlearn\nthis social programming and become quite good random number\ngenerators but normally we tend to conform.\n\nThere is a way two humans can generate a truly random number\nwithout training. Find a friend for this experiment. One of you should\npick any number between one and ten and start counting under your\nbreath, when you get to ten just go back to one and keep repeating. The\nother should wait a while and then shout stop. The number reached should\nbe genuinely random. Please post the results on my website and I’ll tell\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015734",
