  "text": "defenses” blocking a sale and effectively locking the trust in a minority position. But\nnow that danger was over. The remaining plaintiffs were my three nieces and Paul. |\n\ncouldn't blame them. How could a corporate co-trustee hurt?\n\nBut I was still worried. I now wanted to split up the trust into four separate ones for\nmy family, Paul’s, George’s, and my other half-brother Ronnie’s. Corporate co-\ntrustees tend to prefer the safety of acting only as required, and anyhow might not\n\nbe keen to vote themselves out of a job.\n\nWere Paul and my nieces mad at me? Believe it. Lawsuits get that way. Lawyers on\nboth sides say nasty things. That lasted because splitting the Trust took time. The\nmath was easy, but the legal precedents were vague. My lawyer, Mose Lasky,\nthought we needed new California law. Plaintiff's counsel didn’t think so. I was\naccused of stalling. Someone had the bright idea to approach Willy Brown as\nSpeaker of the Senate. The law Mose wanted had already worked in other states,\nand Willy liked it. He pushed it through. Problem solved. The Trust was split into\nfour in 1988, and an unhappy chapter ended. My nieces and | are as close as ever. So\n\nwere Paul and I until his death in 2002.\n\nMy interests by the time of the split were composing, verse, economics, human\norigins and evolutionary biology. Composing was going pretty well. My writer's\nblock had melted away in the summer of 1980. Ann and | and the boys were in Paris\nthen. We wandered into Smith’s English language bookstore. | bought the Thomas\nJohnson variorum of Emily Dickenson’s 1800-odd poems. “Variorum” means\nincluding Emily’s own variations when she mailed the same poem to different\n\npeople, or put a copy in the chest at the foot of her bed.\n\nI read them all over the next two days. Emily had been one of my favorites at USF.\nShe died in 1886. She had published only eleven poems. Squabbles among the heirs\ndelayed publication of about half the rest until Johnson published them in 1959,\nthree years after | graduated. Many already published had been “bowdlerized” to fit\nconventional rhyme and grammar. Johnson gave us the real McCoy from her\n\nmanuscripts. All was new to me.\n\nChapter 1: Recollections 1/06/16 13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010929",
