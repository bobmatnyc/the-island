  "text": "guess you wanted to save money. ?\nThe audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that i have been violently squawking about. ie\n. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucci is still there , joslin part\ntime, but relied on . joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the office's finance team,\naccounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your interest. ( saving money again\n?) its nuts!!.a still non-existent IT dept. impossible , it was the first thing on my list of things that were\nneeded to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of , though its prophylactic quality has been discussed\nover and over during the past three years . computers do not read Page Six. the women atthe IRS do.! you\nsaid your motivation in keeping this group of part timers was a consequence of the high cost of my\nartwork. . the unfortunate result was easily predictable. - now\nIf you want my and my atelier to continue, I will oversee the audits. take charge of the TRA BRH\n\nassignments and review 2012 amendment options!!( note :your redo of the estate fire drill has not progressed\nvery far ). Lots of paper needs to be collected and reviewed, At MY direction. the outside team will be brought\nin at my expense working for me and you. coming in for interviews and reviews, . sucession, technology, tax\nand compliance. investment reporting , , computerized timelines for filings etc. . household\nclassifcations and reporting with a system of best practices.\n\nMy goal is clear - to end, not extend , our financial interactions. you will have a machine that works , it\nwill not be complexto oversee , to create it, is some thing else . Unfortunatley for us both, the price for my\nworks has not changed since day one. 40m per year, I m willing to discount it to 35 as I did give you a bad\nnumber when asked and should pay an embarassment fine. Im also aware, as you made perfectly clear . that\nyou have already paid what you consider a great deal of money, for my work , but again its value exceeds\nanything else by far in your collection at a cost less than agreed upon. . please also remember that you andi\nagreed no more demands on my time after the last payment for the big transaction.\n\nOR, you can decide that brad , tom , and whomever else you choose can screw with my work and they can\noversee your audits. they are both aware and sensitive to the issue at hand. alan could be brought in but i\nwould be extra careful having paul weiss given access to entire story.\n\n_-On an unrelated note- you recently seemed shy to discuss certain things. , please be assured I make no\njudgement on any of your activities , whether or not i agree with them . not my role I am always on your side\non the table. I hope your personal life quiets. you ‘ve had a rough 15 months.\n\n3. Remind me to talk to you about MR\nDate: Mon, Sep 19, 2016 at 8:56 PM\nSubject:\n\ndec 2015\nIT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off\nexercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, ,consultants\nup the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without\nbrads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is\nrun roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger .\nEileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is\nrampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out\nthey cannot be used at all. ( ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they\nsaid that is the question they get asked ! \" were they deducted \"not -\"1is there a benefit\" !! I asked for the\nbalance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. \"sorry we never\ngot one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing , a construction project run amok , no budget, the coo\nfired after only 3 months. , no clue. I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess.\n\nAs your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive\nThe following is alist of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me.\n\nisuggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023326",
