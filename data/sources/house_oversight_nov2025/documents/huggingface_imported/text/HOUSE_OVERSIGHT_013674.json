  "text": "For C.S. Lewis, religious faith came from intellectual hard work. He was put\noff by spirituality that arrived by thoughtless fiat. He rejected the idea of living in\nsimple and loving direct conversation with the God within, as described by Brother\nLawrence. Lawrence was described as the simple “great awkward fellow who broke\neverything.” Lewis had little faith in what he perceived as the mindless spiritual\nmethodology of this selfless, silent, hard working Parisian monastery cook for a\nhundred fellow monks who was also their dedicated smelly sandal repairer. Perhaps\nreflecting his place in the British intellectual class system, Lewis wrote that\nLawrence’s conversations and letters in the brief pamphlet, Practice of the\nPresence of God, “...full of truth... but unctuous and repulsive.” At the same time,\nLewis spoke of his own experiential evidence for God in Surprised by Joy in which\nhe admits, “| am an empirical theist. | have arrived at God by induction.” It is likely\nthat Brother Lawrence did not know and did not need to know the difference\nbetween an inductive and deductive argument.\n\nFor most of my years, | have been a subject of Jamesian transcendent\nexperience, LSD expansive visions, Sufi moving meditation, long distance running,\nBlack Baptist shouting, Tantric orgasmic withholding, Yiddish Labovicher dancing,\nCharismatic Christian Church rock and rolling, Hindi meditative rising Kundalini,\nalmost any ecstatic crisis inducing, God type. Recall that | am from a generation\nthat a Donovan song inspired to smoke bananas. | did not personally access\nBrother Lawrence’s calm, work-a-day, devotional, quietly persistent, perspective\nyielding, inner conversations with God until my sixth decade. The opportunity came\nfrom my growingly severe, unfixably chronic, pain. The counter-intuitive insight and\nhelpful identification was gained from reading about Joseph de Beaufort’s\nconversations with Brother Lawrence. Beaufort said Lawrence was born with the\nname Nicholas Herman in 1611 and renamed Lawrence in honor of his parish\npriest. As young soldier in the Thirty Years War of the 17\" Century, he was severely\ninjured. He was left with both sciatic nerves trapped between bone spurs and tissue\nscarring from his early twenties. These injuries, involving the two biggest pain-\nconducting nerves in the body, left him crippled in gait and in chronically severe\n\nlower back and leg pain from which he would never be free. It was after this time\n\n174\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013674",
