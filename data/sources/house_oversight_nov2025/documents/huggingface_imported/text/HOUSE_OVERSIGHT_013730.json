  "text": "In his statistical explorations of experimental results in hydrodynamic\nturbulence, Mandelbrot (1974) called attention to the need for a multiplicity of\ncharacteristic scaling exponents, a range of values for each exponent and their\nsensitivity to orbital point density distributions (the latter called the Sinai-Ruelle-\nBowen or natural measure (Eckmann and Ruelle, 1985)). These needs grew out of\nthe intrinsic heterogeneity in the time dynamics and the nonuniform point\ndistributions in phase space of orbitally divergent, real physical systems. Even with\nrelatively uniform orbital point distributions, it is intuitively obvious that as e > 0, the\nsmaller e- cubes are over-represented and larger e- cubes are under-represented in\nthe M(e) computation (Farmer et al, 1983). For a concrete example, the fraction of\nthe total number of cubes containing say 75% of the points would obviously\ndecrease as the e-lengths studied gets smaller. Normalizing the Dj measures with\nrespect to point densities would correct for this systematic distortion. In addition, the\nnon-systematic influence of real system heterogeneity and non-uniformity in both\ntime and reconstruction space distributions makes the need for relating the Dj\n\nmeasures to the natural measure even more pressing.\n\nThe derivation of many separate scaling exponents, as well as global\ngeneralized exponents and the incorporation of point densities in their computation,\nhas been approached by a kind of method of moments (Renyi, 1970; Grassberger,\n1983; Hentschel and Procaccia, 1983; Halsey et al, 1986; Mayer-Kress, 1986; Ott et\nal, 1994). We outline the general arguments here so that the reader will be\ngenerally familiar with the ideas and terms, not to serve as a definitive summary. It\nis a complicated area and the reader will find the required detailed descriptions in\n\nthe references. .\n\nWe recall that with respect to a statistical distribution, the first moment is the\nmean; the second moment, o”, the variance; the third moment, o°, the distribution’s\nasymmetry, the skew; and the fourth moment, o”, its relative peakedness with\nrespect to the probability mass in the tail, called the kurtosis. In these moment\ncomputations of an observable x,’s deviation from the mean, |x, — x|*, the value for\n\nq accentuate particular regions of the density distribution.
