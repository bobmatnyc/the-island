Topics: Portfolios, US corporate profits and the Twilight of the Gods (in the US, Europe, China and the IEA)

Here’s what our U.S. Balanced portfolio looks like right now’.
This week’s note reviews some of the factors that affect these
allocations: healthy private sector profits, problems left
over from the recession, and interventions by the world’s
legislatures, treasuries, central banks and multilateral
agencies. This latter group reminds me of the ancient Greek
Gods: they are very powerful, but sometimes flawed, as their
interventions in the world did not always work as planned.
We are getting closer to the Twilight of the Gods, a time when
they are either running out of ammunition, or the ability to use
it without causing even more problems. If so, the private
sector will have to recover on its own. The consequence of
these cross-currents: we invest in equities, but hold 10%-15%
less than what we normally would at this point of the business
cycle, and are positioning for a single-digit year on equities.

The primary (and perhaps sole) justification for carrying the levels of risk shown above relates to corporate profits. As
shown below, profit margins have reached levels not seen in decades. The challenge, which we have discussed many times
before: what is driving these margins’? One useful way to deconstruct profits is to measure them from peak to peak, and
analyze what changed. As shown in the first chart, S&P 500 profit margins increased by ~1.3% from 2000 to 2007. There are a
lot of moving parts in the margin equation, but as shown in the second chart, reductions in wages and benefits explain the
majority of the net improvement in margins. This trend has continued; as we have shown several times over the last two
years, US labor compensation is now at a 50-year low relative to both company sales and US GDP (see EoTM April 26, 2011).

Last week’s train wreck of a labor report included the dour news that labor compensation is now firmly negative in real
terms. Why is US labor compensation so low? The lingering excess labor supply from the recession is one reason, but the 2
billion people in Asia joining the global labor force over the last two decades is another. As shown on next page, EM wages for
production workers remain well below US levels*. Another factor helping profit margins: increased US imports of intermediate
goods from Asia. As shown in the accompanying chart, imports from Asia have been rising, and over the same time frame,

Asian import prices only increased at around 1% per year.

We use these portfolios to manage assets for clients who give us discretion over their funds, and to provide recommendations to those who
don’t. This is one of several model portfolios we manage globally. They differ by jurisdiction, risk tolerance, tax treatment, eligibility to
purchase vehicles designated for qualified purchasers, and other factors.

* Empirical Research Partners does more work on corporate profits than anyone else we’ve seen. This section draws on research that Mike
Goldstein at Empirical shared with us at a recent investment committee meeting.

> A recent study from Boston Consulting Group maintains that the gap between China and the US will close in 5 years. BCG believes that
with Chinese wages growing at 15%-20% per year, US wages growing at 3% per year, higher productivity in the US and rising shipping and
inventory costs, the China advantage will disappear within the decade. Some of these assumptions seem aggressive to apply in perpetuity.
