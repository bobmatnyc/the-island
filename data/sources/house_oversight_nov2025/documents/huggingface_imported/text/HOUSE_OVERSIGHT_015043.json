  "text": "buzz-would serve as my lifetime filter for perceiving reality and its rules. If\nyou could somehow translate that buzz into words, it would spell out: One\nperson's logic is another person's humor.\n\n| finished playing “Vivaldi” by rote. Then | bowed to the audience\nand walked off stage. The applause continued, and | was pushed back on\nstage by my violin teacher, to play an encore, “Orientale.” | had\npreviously asked him-while rehearsing the encore—why it wasn't listed on\nthe program since we already knew that | would play it at the concert. But\ninstead of answering my question, he poked me in the chest, verbalizing\neach poke: “Violin up/ Violin up’ Now, while playing “Orientale,” |\nheard the echo of his voice, and | automatically raised my violin higher.\n\nThen | popped my ears and the music sounded clearer. | wondered if\nit sounded clearer to the audience too. They had no idea that their\nlaughter had woken me up. | was overwhelmed by the notion that\neverybody in the audience had their own individual 7his-/s-me, but maybe\nsome of them were still asleep and didn't know it. How could you tell who\nwas awake and who was asleep? After all, | hadn't known that /was asleep,\nand look what | accomplished before | woke up. If it hadn't been for that\n\nitch, | might st///be asleep.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015043",
