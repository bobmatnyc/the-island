  "text": "Revisiting and re-evaluating strategies and plans are ongoing processes. They aren’t only restricted to times of\n\ncrises. Life is full of changes and developments, but only the clear-headed can effectively monitor and examine\nthese changes and identify their trends and then determine how much these developments will impact their own\nstrategies and plans.\n\nDALAL ABU GHAZALA, Al Hayat Newspaper\n\nSome Western media are trying to defame the UA E either through exaggerating the\nimpact of the economic downturn on Dubai, or through inaccurate reports such as\nHuman Rights Watch’s on the Media Law in the UAE. What do you think are the reasons\nbehind such campaigns? And what is your response to these campaigns?\n\nWe don’t care who stands behind such campaigns, but rather pay attention to the content of these reports either\nissued by media or international nongovernmental organizations. We deal with such reports with absolute\nobjectivity -- for example when producers of these reports express their wish to visit the UAE and meet\nconcerned officials, we open our doors for them and welcome all constructive discussions, offering them full\nbriefings on all facts. We attentively listen to their views and, I like to think, so do they.\n\nRegarding Human Rights Watch’s report on the UAE’s new draft media law, the international organisation’s\nofficials were in the country last week. They met with the concerned UAE officials who defended the law and\ndisputed the report’s inaccurate remarks, explaining the law’s different clauses and articles. They tried to steer\nthe report’s producers away from any misleading interpretations of its content.\n\nPAUL STOBER, Gulf News\n\nThe government has taken significant steps to support the financial services and\nproperty industries in the UAE. Are you happy with the results so far?\n\nI am very pleased with the results, and I am confident we are on the right track. Everybody will recognise\nshortly the encouraging indicators of the economic recovery.\nPAUL STOBER, Gulf News\n\nIfit became necessary, what further steps of support would the government consider for\nthe financial services and property industries? Would the government consider\nextending support to other important industries in the UAE, like tourism? Ifso, what\nform might this take?\n\nThe measures we have undertaken so far have shifted the UAE economy from the crisis mood to the solution\nmood. Not one country in the world, regardless of what efficient systems it boasts, could have ensured recovery\nfrom the financial crisis before recognising its actual impact on the global economy and international markets.\nNo one could predict ensuring recovery before the world’s leading economies consolidates their efforts to face\nthe crisis. That actually took several months of constant work. Now, optimistic voices are getting louder\nworldwide, while markets’ fear has started to gradually diminish.\n\nThe UAE has one of the region’s most progressive, vibrant and open economies. Efforts by world leading\neconomies to deal with the financial crisis have been effective and fruitful, while the tendency to increase\ninternational cooperation — including recent decisions by the G20 summit in London — remains very positive\nand encouraging. I can confidently say that the UA E is very well positioned on the recovery path, thanks to our\ndomestic policy measures — such as the fiscal stimulus, easing monetary policy, and increasing liquidity in the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024950",
