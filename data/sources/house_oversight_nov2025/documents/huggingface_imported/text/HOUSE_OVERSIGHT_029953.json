  "text": "22\n\nOf course, this is anathema to the U.S., particularly its navy. In this\ncase, the DOC or even a convention will be of little utility. Let us\nhope that the real explanation is more benign. One possibility is\nconfusion and lack of coordination between high policy officials in\nforeign affairs and the military, particularly the PLA Navy. But this\ncould also mean that China's foreign policy is in flux or disarray on\nthis issue and that the PLA Navy has emerged as a trendsetter and\nspokesperson thereon.\n\nRemember that just as U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert Gates\narrived in January on his historic visit to China, its military tested a\nstealth fighter and the civilian leadership appeared to have been\ncaught unawares.\n\nIf the military is on occasion acting independently of the civilian\nleadership, this could explain the seeming dichotomy between\nChinese officials' words and PLA Navy actions. But this would\nindeed be worrying.\n\nIn any event the situation looks likely to get worse before it gets\nbetter. More surveys and exploratory drilling are planned in areas\nclaimed by China. And Vietnam has conducted an offshore live-fire\ndrill and has called for international — including U.S. — help to\nresolve the issues. Rare anti-China protests have broken out in Hanoi\nand Manila. At this point all one can say is hold on to your hat.\n\nMark Valencia, a former senior fellow with the East-West Center, is\na maritime policy analyst.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029953",
