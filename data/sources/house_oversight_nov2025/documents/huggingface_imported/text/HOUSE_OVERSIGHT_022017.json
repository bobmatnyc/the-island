The\net with defense counsel in Fall\nie office’s position: two years,\nn, or trial.\n\nmonths, the defense team pre-\nrgument claiming that felony\n\ninst Epstein were unsupported\n\ned a basis in law, and that the 4\ntime was motivated by a zeal to 5\n\ny because he is wealthy. They\n\nnts with legal opinions from\n\nin\nij\n\n208 q\n\nFirtHy RicuH\n\nwell-known legal experts. One member of the defense\nteam warned me that the office’s excess zeal in forcing a\ngood man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a\nbook if we continued to proceed with the matter. My\noffice systematically considered and rejected each argu-\nment, and when we did, my office’s decisions were\nappealed to Washington. As to the warning, I ignored it.\n\nThe defense strategy was not limited to legal issues.\nDefense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and\ntheir families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may\nprovide a basis for disqualification. Disqualifying a pros-\necutor is an effective (though rarely used) strategy, as\neliminating the individuals most familiar with the facts\nand thus most qualified to take a case to trial harms like-\nlihood for success. Defense counsel tried to disqualify at\nleast two prosecutors. I carefully reviewed, and then\nrejected, these arguments.\n\nDespite the army of attorneys, the office held firm to\nthe terms first presented to Mr. Black in the original\nmeeting. On June 30, 2008, after yet another last minute\nappeal to Washington D.C. was rejected, Epstein pled\nguilty in state court. He was to serve 18 months impris-\nonment, register as a sexual offender for life, and provide\nrestitution to the victims.\n\nSome may feel that the prosecution should have been\ntougher. Evidence that has come to light since 2007 may\nencourage that view. Many victims have since spoken\nout, filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking dam-\nages. Physical evidence has since been discovered. Had\n\n_ these additional statements and evidence been known,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022017",
