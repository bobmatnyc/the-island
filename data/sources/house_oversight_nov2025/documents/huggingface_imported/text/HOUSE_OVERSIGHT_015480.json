  "text": "NAUTILUS EDUCATION\n\nNitrogen: Your natural curls\n\nThe next time you brush your hair, think of the nitrog-\nenous waste that helped create it. All of your proteins,\nincluding hair keratin, contain formerly airborne\nnitrogen atoms. But the nitrogen in air is biologically\ninert. For nitrogen to become a component of your\nhair, it has to be converted into a more accessible form.\nNitrogen-fixing bacteria is one way that can happen.\nThey live among the roots of beans, peas, and other\nlegumes, consuming atmospheric nitrogen and releas-\ning it as ammonia, a kind of microbial manure that\nfertilizes soil in which plants grow. When you eat a\nplant, you consume formerly atmospheric nitrogen.\n\nBETA PRODUCT\n\nEvery flash of lightning and every automotive spark\nplug emits a puff of nitrogen oxide, which can dissolve\ninto raindrops and fall to earth as a form of fertilizer,\nagain finding its way into food webs through plants.\nBut most of the nitrogen in modern foods comes from\nurea and ammonium nitrate fertilizers artificially fixed\nby industrial processes. In ages past, the nitrogen in\nhuman hair came mainly from bacterial waste and\nlightning. But today, unless you eat a strictly organ-\nic diet, you run your hairbrush through nitrogenous\nframeworks that are mostly of human origin.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015480",
