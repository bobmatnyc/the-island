He would come up from DC. We can always do Skype, of course, but\nPeter would appreciate to meet in person early in the process. Breakthroughs is a Big Project, big opportunity\nfor impact. All are truly excited.\n\nBelow are highlights of Breakthroughs progress.\n\nAttached is latest CNN on trade war and below are links (caution: a few weeks old is ancient history in Trump\ntime).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026317",
