  "text": "BBC World News\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn\n\nChina’s Economy & Politics\n\nPresident Xi’s ‘Four Comprehensives’\nAugust 25, 2015\n\nHOST: Dr. Robert Lawrence Kuhn is an advisor to the\nChinese government and author of How China’s\nLeaders Think and he joins me now from Beijing. A\ncut in interest rates today - but in China any economic\ndecision is always colored with politics.\n\nRLK: Certainly people are concerned here, but you\nhave to realize a 43% drop in the Shanghai stock\nmarket is still 25° above its 52-week lows, so what\nthe economists, government, tries to do is to\ndistinguish between the so-called real economy and\nthe stock market. Most people realize China’s stock\nmarket was overvalued, but perception is reality, and\nif people have less money on paper, they'll spend less,\nand so the fall will affect the real economy.\n\nAnd you're right, the way to look at such situations in\nChina is not just economically - you can’t look at\nChina without looking at politics, and here there are\ntwo major areas. One is President Xi Jinping’s state\nvisit to Washington. This has been a very tense time\nin Sino-US relations: South China Sea, cybersecurity,\nhuman rights, lots of issues. But what this economic\nuncertainty and volatility will do - I hope - is to make\nboth presidents focus on what really affects human\nbeings and human lives, focus on economic areas,\nbecause this is where there can be some commonality\nbetween China and the US. The contentious issues are\nreal, but economics is more real for people.\n\nDomestically in China, it’s really interesting, because\nin recent days, there have been editorials in People’s\nDaily talking about extreme resistance to reform and\nolder leaders who are still involved and maybe\nshouldn’t be, and so you have to look at domestic\npolitics in terms of what Xi Jinping, who is China’s\ndominant leader, the president of the country, head\nof the party, head of the military, and other titles as\nwell, and what his overarching policy is.\n\nIt’s called the “Four Comprehensives.” We learn from\neach one. The first says that China wants to build a\n‘moderately prosperous society’. That’s their short-\nterm goal. It’s not different than others have said in\n\n- BBS News\n\nCHINA MARKETS FALL\n\nChina cuts interest rates for fifth time since Nov\n\nCHINA MARKETS FALL\n\nChina stocks continue to tumble\n\nCHINA MARKETS FALL\nYesterday Shanghai markets saw biggest fall in 8 years\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023696",
