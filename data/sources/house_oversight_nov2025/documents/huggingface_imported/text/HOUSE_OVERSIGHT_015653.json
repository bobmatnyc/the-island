  "text": "whether other responsive records may exist, but whether the search was adequate.”); Wilbur v.\nCLA., 355 F.3d 675, 678 (D.C. 2004) (court explaining that “the agency’s failure to turn up a\nparticular document, or mere speculation that as yet uncovered documents might exist, does not\nundermine the determination that the agency conducted an adequate search for the requested\nrecords.”). Moreover, when dealing with a former President’s security detail travel, there are a\nnumber of reasons why the government may not disclose those records.\n\nAs explained above, public flight records from Jeffrey Epstein’s private plane show that\nPresident Clinton traveled with Jeffrey Epstein on multiple occasions. Nevertheless, if Defendant\nDershowitz wants to pursue this issue before the Court, then he needs to produce for deposition\ntestimony in this case and the proposed criminal investigation, the other witnesses that were\npresent on the island at the time former President Clinton was alleged to have visited, including\nhis client Jeffrey Epstein, and Ghislaine Maxwell, to whom he has testified he is party to a joint\ndefense agreement. It is worth noting on that point, that despite Mr. Epstein’s counsel’s\nattendance at depositions in this case, and Defendant Dershowitz’s claim that Mr. Epstein is still\nhis client, Mr. Epstein has taken extreme measures to avoid being deposed in this case despite\nbeing ordered to deposition by this Court.\n\nIndeed, it is also noteworthy that during Defendant Dershowitz’s recent deposition,\ncounsel for Mr. Edwards and Mr. Cassell asked Defendant Dershowitz the following question:\n“Was Virginia Roberts lying when she said Jeffrey Epstein socialized with Bill Clinton during the\nrelevant time period?” Depo Tr. Of Alan Dershowitz, Vol. 4, January 12, 2016 at 511. Before\nDefendant Dershowitz could answer, Mr. Dershowitz’s legal counsel interposed an attorney-client\nprivilege objection. /d. Perhaps Mr. Epstein’s defense counsel can provide to the Court an\nappropriate privilege log regarding that objection — and all the communications between Mr.\nEpstein and Defendant Dershowitz that would have been revealed in answer to that question — so\n\nthat the Court will have the benefit of a full record in ruling on this motion.\n\n4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015653",
