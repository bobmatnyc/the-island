He declared that anyone who crossed this \"line of death\"\nwould be subject to attack. The U.S. was planning maneuvers in the\nGulf of Sidra and went inside this 200-mile zone. Qadhafi sent out\nthree sorties of jets against them, which were promptly shot down.\nBut after, it was interesting. He said, \"I want to thank the United\nStates for making me a hero to the Third World.\" Standing tall\nagainst a superior adversary has great value in the Arab world.\n\nIn your view, is there anything that Qadhafi could have done to\nremain in power or is he just fundamentally out of touch with\nLibya today?\n\nOne should remember back to Saddam Hussein again, and how long\nit was before we finally found him. I believe that until the end he\nbelieved that he could get past this and would reach heroic stature for\nstanding up against the enemy, and that his people would support\nhim. A couple of questions get asked about leaders here. A, would he\ngo off to a lush exile as, say, [former Haitian president] \"Baby Doc\"\nDuvalier did? Or B, would he commit suicide? I don't think either of\nthose is in the cards for Qadhafi. In fact, he gave this defiant speech\non August 21, which insisted that he was in Tripoli and wouldn't\nsurrender: \"We cannot go back until the last drop of our blood. I am\nhere with you. Go on. Go forward.\" And in a brief television\nstatement the same day, \"Go out and take your weapons, all of you.\nThere should be no fear.\" It's a rather different thing than Churchill,\nwho was advised to move out of London and instead stayed there to\nabsorb the Blitz along with the British people. He was sort of a role\nmodel for heroism and spoke—again in the first person plural—\nabout, \"We will stand tall, we will resist this tyranny.\" It was really\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024597",
