This confirms the traditional view\n\n(A5.1) if (A5.5) is right in interpreting prior claims on pay as zero.\n\nIf 1 was wrong there, and Quesnay and the physiocrats were right, some\n\nmaintenance consumption would be recovered in revenue of its suppliers. Then I\nshould have written something like C=C_+C_ +C, , where “transfer consumption”\nC,_ was the value recovered by suppliers. This mathematical possibility, which I do\n\nnot claim to have disproved, explains why I do not claim that the pay rule is logical\ncertainty as a whole. | claim certitude only for its most surprising feature: human\ndepreciation is expected to be recovered in pay.
