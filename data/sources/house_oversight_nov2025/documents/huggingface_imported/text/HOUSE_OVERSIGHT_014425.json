This is the opposite of the situation some months ago (USD/JPY’s\ndownside risk to 110 — sell on rally 10 February 2016). First, CFTC speculative position\nremains yen long though short-term traders are probably positioned for the upside\nalready (Chart 3). Second, we believe domestic activity to raise hedge ratio has run its\ncourse as the USD/JPY swept through the sensitive level this year. As 2HFY16 (Oct ‘16-\nMar ‘17} has started, most life insurance companies are reportedly inclined to increase\nexposure to unhedged foreign bonds though they generally remain price sensitive. In our\nview, this is reflected in the USD/JPY’s consolidation during Tokyo trading hours after\nthe pair hit 100 on the Brexit vote (Chart 4). The fact that USD/JPY has failed to break\n100 multiple times since then suggests the market looking for USD/JPY’s dip, light\npositioning, and the market’s judgment that USD should be more expensive than 100\nJPY.
