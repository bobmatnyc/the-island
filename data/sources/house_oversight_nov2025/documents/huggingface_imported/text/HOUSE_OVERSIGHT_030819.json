Here are a couple of generalizations:\n\ne Less expensive options like pumped hydro and compressed air storage require favorable sites with the right geology, which\nare rare in nature and expensive to build from scratch (and often not located near electricity demand centers), and in the case\nof compressed air, require co-located gas turbines for compression\n\ne Many battery-based technologies suffer from high upfront capital or operating costs; low energy storage volumes; delayed\nresponse times; safety issues (such as zinc bromine); or short lives (limited number of recharge cycles)\n\nI had a meeting a few weeks ago which was notable for its The cost of electricity storage options\noptimism and enthusiasm. I met with the managers of Eos Range of levelized costs, $ perkWh\nEnergy Storage, which is working on a zinc air battery solution $0.60\n\nwhich aims to conquer all of the obstacles outlined in the second\nbullet point above. If the Eos projections bear out, they will offer\nbattery storage at a capital cost of ~$160 per kWh, in the form of\na 1 MW battery that is the size of a 40 foot shipping container\n(for 6 MWh of storage). As with the table on page 2, the concept —go.40\nof “levelized cost” synthesizes upfront costs, financing costs,\n\nuseful life, fuel costs and ongoing maintenance expenses. Rather\n\nthan looking projections of capital costs per kWh, levelized cost $0.30\ncomparisons are more useful. As shown, Eos aims to be the\ncheapest option that can be scaled, and flexibly and safely located\nwhere needed. Note as well that they expect to be cheaper than\nnatural gas peaking plants. This is a relevant benchmark, since\nmost utilities rely on natural gas peaking plants to meet daily $0.10\npeak load requirements and to compensate for intermittent\n\nrenewable generation of wind and solar. If storage works, the\n\nneed for lots of peaking facilities could disappear.\n\n$0.50\n\n$0.20\n\nPumped Hydro\nSodium-Sulfur\nZinc-Bromine\nVanadium Redox\nZinc-Air Redox\n\nEos has a prototype of its Zinc-Air technology that has run\naround 2,000 cycles so far; we should all pray either for their\nsuccess, or for the success of similar efforts undertaken by their\ncompetitors. Based on the outcome of energy dreams shown on\np.1, we should always be skeptical of breakthrough claims, given\nthe complexity of the challenge. Let’s hope for the best.\n\nCAES (Below ground)\nCAES (Above ground)\nAdvanced Lead-Acid\nlron-Chromium Redox\nProposed Zinc-Air Solution\nGas peaking plants\n\nSource: EPRI, Electricity Energy Storage Technology Options, 2010, Eos.\nCAES: Compressed Air Energy Storage.\n\nHere’s another look at the financial rewards to anyone who can figure this out. Note how demands on the Texas electricity\ngrid (ERCOT) are almost 100% inversely correlated with when the wind blows. Either ERCOT gets connected to the national\ngrid, storage solutions are invented, or a lot of wind energy continues to be underutilized. On the right, what happens when\n70% of the grid’s transmission lines, transformers and circuit breakers are 25-30 years old: rising congestion problems,\nsignified by rising loading relief requests. Grid storage has the potential to alleviate some of this congestion.\n\nTexas electricity demand vs. actual wind output Transmission loading relief requests\nMegawatts Megawatts Numberof incidents, 2002 - 2008\n70,000 7,400 90\n65,000 Demand 80 Independent Coordinator of Transmission for Entergy\n60,000 5,920 70 mu Midwest Independent Transmission System Operator |\n55,000 go | =™PJMInterconnection (Southeast/Midwest)\n50,000 4,440 50 Tennessee Valley Authority\n“3,000 mu Southwest Power Pool\n40,000 2960 40\n35,000 30\n30,000 ; 1480 920\n25,000 Wind output 40\n20,000 0 0\nent Bir\" Bain\" Benn 8/5/11 8/6/11 8/7/11 8/8/11 2002 2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008\nSource: Electric Reliability Council of Texas.
