  "text": "Key financial market driver 2 - US policy\n\nKey questions\n\ne Will the economic outlook deteriorate? Will QE3 become necessary?\n\ne How will the election outcome change fiscal policy deliberations?\n\n© Can politicians find an agreement to avoid sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (\"fiscal cliff\")?\n\nCIO View (Probability: 65%*) No QE3, political gridlock and some fiscal tightening\n¢ The economy stays on a moderate growth path, coupled with stable core PCE inflation close to the Fed’s\ntarget of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 1.5% in 2Q 2012 (consensus: 2.1%) and 2.3% in 3Q 2012\n(consensus: 2.4%), with some downside risk due to rising uncertainty. The Fed has decided to extend so\ncalled \"Operation Twist\" until the end of the year. More near-term monetary easing is still possible, but it\nis currently not our central scenario.\n\n¢ In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House overall, but retain a majority; we also\nexpect them to win a narrow majority in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an\nelectoral outcome would confirm the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.\n\ne Against the backdrop of ongoing political gridlock, we expect only moderate fiscal tightening of about\n0.9% of GDP in 2013. The government will likely let unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut expire,\nbut postpone income tax hikes and sequestration spending.\n\nA Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) No QE3, Democratic sweep and more fiscal tightening\n\n¢ Propelled by ultra-expansive monetary policy and improved confidence, cyclical forces surmount the\nstructural hindrances and thus growth accelerates. More rapid growth leads to higher inflation, and the\nFed responds by tightening monetary policy sooner.\n\n¢ The improved economic outlook raises the odds for an Obama re-election and makes it harder for\nRepublicans to win a majority in the Senate. US fiscal consolidation efforts are facilitated by faster rising\ntax collections. A Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited spending cuts. Fiscal policy\ntightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.\nNegative scenario (Probability: 25%*)\n¢ Structural hindrances dominate and weigh on the cyclical recovery, thus growth weakens or turns\nnegative. The Fed embarks on QE3, most likely in the form of agency MBS and Treasury purchases.\n\ne Weaker economic conditions raise the odds for a larger Republican majority in Congress, but Obama\nremains President. The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end.\nThe political gridlock becomes dysfunctional, thus fiscal policy tightens by USD 600 billion (3.7% of UBS\nestimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013 (“fiscal cliff”). The US credit rating is downgraded.\n\nQE3, political dysfunction and huge fiscal tightening\n\nKey dates\n\n2 July ISM manufacturing PMI for June\n\n6 July Nonfarm payrolls and unemployment rate for June\n6 Nov US Presidential and Congressional elections\n\n36 UBS\n\nUS moderate growth to continue\n\nUS real GDP and its components, quarter-over-quarter\nannualized in %\n\nq/q annualized UBS CIO\nforecasts\n\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n-10%\n-12%\n\nQ1 2006 Q1 2007 Q1 2008 Q1 2009 Q1 2010 Q1 2011 Q1 2012\n\nCommercial real estate investment\nResidential investment\n\nNet Exports\n\nReal GDP (q/q annualized)\n\nmi Consumption\n\nmi Capital expenditures\n@ Inventories\n\nli Government\n\nSource: Thomsen Datastream, UBS CIO, as of 20 June 2012\n\nUS fiscal cliff at year-end 2012\n\nFiscal effects of change in provisions under current law, USD\nbillion annualized\n\n1Q13  2Q13 3Q13 4Q13 CY2013\n\na\n5\n\n-68 = 6) = 16) 70)\n\nS15 NA Bleu\n\nie) -374  -125 ae) fe\n-94 114-114-114 -109\n\na\nKR\n\naly aly aly any aoe\n-433 -847  -587)— -534 -600\n\nSource: Goldman Sachs, UBS CIO, as of 20 June 2012\n* Scenario probabilities are based on qualitative assessment.\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact US economist Thomas Berner, thomas.berner@ubs.com 2\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024144",
