He next directed her to contact Greenwald. “I recommend that at\nthe very minimum you involve Greenwald. I believe you know him.” (Snowden apparently did\nnot tell her that he had unsuccessfully attempted to reach out to Greenwald before he had\ncontacted her.)\n\nHis continued interest in Greenwald was understandable. Aside from Greenwald’s opposition\nto what he called the “Surveillance State,” he was a gateway to the Guardian. The Guardian\nhad become an important player in the business of disclosing government by publishing a large\npart of the US documents supplied to Wikileaks. By breaking whistle-blowing stories about US\nintelligence, it had also greatly increased the circulation of its website. As an establishment\nnewspaper, it also gave these Wikileaks stories credibility with the media. So despite\nGreenwald’s inability to create an encrypted channel, Snowden still needed him. He had no reason\nto believe that Greenwald would turn down the opportunity for a whistle-blowing scoop for the\nGuardian. After all, the classified documents Snowden would provide him would also give\ncredence to both Greenwald’s book and his many blogs denouncing of US government\nsurveillance.\n\nAside from Greenwald and Poitras, Snowden sought an outlet inside the American\nestablishment. So he had Poitras write Barton Gellman, the Pulitzer Prize winning reporter for\nthe Washington Post. Born in 1960, Gellman graduated from Princeton in 1981, and became an\naward-winning investigative reporter from the Miami Herald, Washington Post and Time\nmagazine. He was also the author of the 2008 book Angler: the Cheney Vice-Presidency, which\nbeen made into an HBO mini-series. If Gellman could be drawn into the enterprise, he could\nprovide Snowden with a gateway to the Washington Post, the prestigious American paper\ncredited with bringing down President Richard Nixon in the Watergate scandal.\n\nPoitras, as the go-between for Snowden, immediately contacted Gellman. She already knew\nhim from meetings they both attended at NYU’s Center on Law and Security. After telling him\nshe was involved in a story about NSA surveillance, she suggested that they meet in New York\nCity.\n\nFor their rendezvous, Poitras took a number of precautions to evade anyone attempting to\nfollow her. She had Gellman first meet her in one coffee shop in lower Manhattan. When he\narrived, she had him follow her on foot to another coffee shop following her anti-surveillance\ntradecraft. Once assured no one was watching them, she ordered coffee for herself and Gellman.\nOver coffee, she told Gellman about Snowden, who she described as her anonymous source. She\nsaid that he was willing to supply Gellman with documents that would expose domestic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020236",
