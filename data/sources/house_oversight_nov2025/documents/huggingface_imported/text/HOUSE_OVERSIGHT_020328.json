  "text": "176\n\nPenetrating the NSA and getting access to files from its stove-piped computers was a far\nmore difficult challenge for the SVR. Approaching CIA officers, such as Nicholson, was relatively\neasy because it was part of the CIA officer’s job to meet with their adversaries. NSA officers, on\nthe other hand, did not engage in “dangles” or even attend diplomatic receptions. They had not\nreason, other than a sinister one, to meet with a member of the Russian intelligence service.\nFurthermore, unlike CIA officers who, like Nicholson, are often posted in neutral countries where\nthey can be approached in a social context, NSA officers worked at well-guarded regional bases\nand are not part of the diplomatic life. Since a known employee of a foreign diplomatic mission\ncould not even approach a NSA officer without arousing suspicion, the SVR would need to use\nan intermediary, called an “access agent,” whose affiliations with it were not known to the FBI.\nSuch an operation would require establishing a network of illegals in the America, as the SVR did\nafter Putin became President. Even them, the intermediary would have to find a plausible pretext\nto approach the target with revealing his actual interest.\n\nThe emergence of computer networks in the 1990s greatly expanded the SVR’s recruiting\nhorizon. It offered an opportunity to penetrate a new layer at the NSA employees: civilian\ntechnologists working under contract for the US government. Many of these civilians at the\nNSA, especially the younger ones, had been drawn from the hacking and game-playing culture.\nSome had even taken courses abroad on hacking techniques. They presented the SVR was\ninviting targets for recruitment. As was previously mentioned, Russian intelligence had\nconsiderable experience in Germany with hacktavists who tended to be anarchists. There were\nalso supporters of the Libertarian movement. The common denominator was often their\nresentment expressed in their postings s of the United States and its allies attempting to limit the\ndownloading of copy-righted music, movies and software on the Internet, all of which went under\nthe rubric of “freedom of the Internet.” They also vocally objected to the NSA using built-in\nbackdoors in their software to read their encrypted messages. They were not difficult to find on\nthe Internet. The donors to Ron Paul’s Libertarian election campaign (including Snowden) were\na matter of public record, for example.\n\nEven if there was no shortage of hacktavists who believed the surveillance of the Internet by\nthe NSA was an evil worth fighting, the SVR still had to find a plausible way of approaching\nmembers of this counterculture without offending them. Clearly, the SVR could no longer use\nout- of-date Communist and anti-capitalist ideology as a lure. Russia was far more authoritarian\nthan the U.S, when it came to the Internet. One viable alternative for the SVR was custom-\ntailoring false flags to appeal to hacktavists.\n\nFor this purpose the Internet provided a near perfect realm for false flags. Since it is a place\nwhere true identities cannot easily be verified, intelligence services could employ a protean kit of\ndisguises to assume false identities to entice potential dissidents into communicating with them.\nThe KGB’s earlier efforts to use hacktavist groups in Germany had produced little, if any,\nintelligence because of the “stove-piping” the NSA used to isolate its computers from networks\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020328",
