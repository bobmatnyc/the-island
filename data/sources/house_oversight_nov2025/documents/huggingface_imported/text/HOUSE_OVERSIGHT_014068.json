  "text": "2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 89\n\nfelony offenses, broadly extending its protections to victims of any federal\noffense.'”’ Thus, under OLC’s interpretation that the filing of a complaint\ndoes not trigger the CVRA, many victims who are entitled to CVRA\nprotections—i.e., victims of misdemeanor offenses prosecuted by way of\ncomplaint—will never have proper venue to assert those rights because,\naccording to OLC’s strained argument, no prosecution ever started in their\ncases.\n\nEven limiting the focus to felony cases, OLC misleadingly describes\nthe Sixth Amendment case law. It is not immediately clear why one would\nlook to the nght to counsel to determine the breadth of the term\n“prosecution” in the Sixth Amendment. The right to counsel is not the only\nnight found in that Amendment. The Amendment also extends, for\nexample, a right to a speedy trial in all criminal “prosecutions.”'” The case\nlaw on the speedy trial nght makes clear that the right “may attach before\nan indictment and as early as the time of arrest and holding to answer a\ncriminal charge.”\n\nIn any event, the right to counsel cases are quite clear in providing that\na Sixth Amendment “prosecution” can (and often does) begin well before\nan indictment.’ The Supreme Court has directly held that the Sixth\nAmendment’s right to counsel attaches “at or after the time that judicial\nproceedings have been initiated against [a person|—‘whether by way of\nformal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or\narraignment.’”!” Thus, under this controlling precedent, some earlier point\nin time before indictment is the triggering point of a Sixth Amendment\n“prosecution.”\n\nThe cases that OLC cites are not to the contrary. It is true that some\nfederal appeals courts have stated that the mere filing of a criminal\ncomplaint does not trigger a Sixth Amendment right to counsel.'’° But\nthere is a split of authority on this question, as OLC acknowledges in a\nfootnote.'’?
