  "text": "Edwards adv. Epstein\nTelephone interview with Virginia Roberts\nPage 23 of 23\n\nV: Don’t know.\n\nJS: Prince Andrew.\n\nV: Yes, he would know a lot of the truth. Again, I don’t know how much he would be able\nto help you with, but seeing he’s in a lot of trouble himself these days, I think he might,\nso I think he may be valuable. I’m not too sure of him.\n\nJS: Ok. Virginia, I think that’s all I have for you. Let me tell you what I would like to do.\nAs I told you in the beginning of this conversation, we’ve been recording it, and\nhopefully, we’ve got a clear enough recording so that we’ve taken down everything\naccurately and when it’s transcribed, it will be clear and accurate, but what I would like\nto do is transcribe it, send it to you, have you take a look at it, and if there’s anything that\nwe got wrong in the statement, you can write back and you can make changes in the\ntranscript so that the transcript is accurate. Is that fair?\n\nV: No worries. That is fair. No problem.\n\nJS: Alright, great. I really do appreciate that and tell me what the best way is to send the\ntranscript to you.\n\nV: Email. If you just want to send it by email or if you want to send it by mail, either or.\nJS: | Ok. Give me your email address if you would please.\na\n\nJS: Let me read that back to you:\n\nV: Yep that’s it.\n\nBE: Thank you Jenna, appreciate it.\n\nV: No problem, Brad.\n\nJS: | Thank you very very much. Bye Bye now.\n\nV: Take care Jack. Nice meeting you.\n\nJS: You too.\n\n*Redaction has been made at the request of the witness.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012129",
