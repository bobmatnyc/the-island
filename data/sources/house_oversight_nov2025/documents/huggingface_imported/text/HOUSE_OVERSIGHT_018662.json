  "text": "body's reaction to certain types of stimulation. Also: sexual desire is not consent. And\nlove isn't consent, either. If I feel sexual desire for my partner, and my body feels good\nwhen he touches me, and I love him, yet I make it clear that I don't want to have sex right\nnow... then he's still violating my consent if he has sex with me. (Obviously, if I want to\nsay \"no\" and mean \"yes,” then it's my responsibility to negotiate that ahead of time and\nset a safeword.)\n\nIn short: There can be pleasure, desire, and even love existing alongside real abuse.\nBut that doesn't mean it's not abuse. This is as true with S&M as it is with non-S&M\nSex.\n\nI once spoke to a person who referred to himself as an abuser, who told me that he'd read\ndescriptions of S&M aftercare, and that he saw his own tactics within them. He told me\nwhen he thought about it, he had always considered it to be \"brainwashing.\"\n\nAnd I can see it. That's the scary part. I really can see it. I can believe that when we have\npowerful S&M experiences, we tap into the same parts of our brains that could otherwise\nbe used for psychological manipulation and destruction. S&M shows us how to create\nand utilize enormous mental vulnerability through violence... and vulnerability can\nalways be abused. In the literature exploring the cycle of abuse, people often write about\nthe \"reconciliation phase,” in which the abuser is all sweetness and light to their victim; I\ncan't help but wonder how much of the \"reconciliation phase\" could be recognized as\nnon-consensual aftercare. How much of an abuser's power over their victim might come\nfrom the mental malleability that cautious S&Mers learn to respect?\n\nThis does not mean that our bodies are broken. The woman whose words I published at\nthe top of this article called it \"the cruelest of design flaws and the worst people\nunderstand it and the most compassionate people don't.\" But we don't have to perceive\nthis as a flaw -- it's not a flaw any more than orgasms are a flaw. Some S&M instructors\ncompare S&M mental states to \"altered states,\" like being drunk; there's nothing wrong\nwith being drunk, but people should be careful with alcohol. Our bodies are instruments\nwith certain powers and vulnerabilities that we must respect.\n\nThis power and vulnerability is one of the biggest reasons I do the writing that I do.\nBecause although they're invisible, I do have a sense of the fences that FormerWildChild\ntalked about when she commented at Feministe: the fences that keep S&Mers from\nfalling into the Grand Canyon of abuse. Those invisible fences around the canyon are\nconstructed from self-awareness, self-esteem, respect, and consent.\n\nBuilding Fences Around The Canyon\n\nHow do we build fences around the canyon? We build them by seeking to understand our\ndesires, and talk openly with our partners, and respect our partners’ limits. So I write\nabout communication and self-examination and learning to value my boundaries... and I\nhope it will help people learn what it means to play at the edge, rather than falling into\nthe canyon.\n\nThis is scary, loaded, complicated territory. I certainly don't have all the answers. But I\nhave ideas on how we might begin finding answers from here.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018662",
