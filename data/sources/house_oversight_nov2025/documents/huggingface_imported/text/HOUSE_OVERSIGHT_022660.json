Btw, I've just filed a column for USA Today for Monday explaining\nhow Dershowitz and Andrew allegations were picked up from unverified civil court docs, transferred to UK\ntabs, which go wild because of no libel rules on U.S. court papers, and then translated back here as \"reported\nfact.\" Problem with story is that tabs are too invested in present story line, and unlikely that the Times\nor WSJ will want to touch it--tho, depending on who is willing to on record, they might. There is another\npolitico reporter I know who might do it, again, if the on-the-record sources are public people. Or, I will use it\nfor New York Magazine, but that won't be until Feb. Can you still talk tomorrow? When works? Woody and\nSoon-Yi coming for dinner tonight. m\n\nOn Fri, Jan 9, 2015 at 1:20 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nHE. the story teller , crafted much of it out of whole cloth. . part of her story , is that she was at\nmultiple orgies with clinton and speciifically, the minute details of a dinner had on the island withhim, \"he\nsat on my left. came by black. heli. flown by ghislaine. clinton was NEVER EVER there, never. it punches\na hole in the dershowitz , andrew allegation. making it all apparent that it was fantasy. and\ndelusional. thoughts. who should break the story.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
