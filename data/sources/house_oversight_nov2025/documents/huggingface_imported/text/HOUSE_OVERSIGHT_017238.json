Nast's castigation of the\nTweed Ring, Walt McDougall's characterization of presidential candidate James G.\nBlaine's banquet with the millionaires at Delmonico's as \"The Royal Feast of Belshazzar,\"\nand numerous other efforts have undoubtedly had an effect on the course and outcome of\ncontemporaneous debate. Lincoln's tall, gangling posture, Teddy Roosevelt's glasses and\nteeth, and Franklin D. Roosevelt's jutting jaw and cigarette holder have been memorialized\nby political cartoons with an effect that could not have been obtained by the photographer\nor the portrait artist. From the viewpoint of history it is clear that our political discourse\nwould have been considerably poorer without them.”\n\nIt ruled that parodies and caricatures, even revolting ones, were protected by the First\nAmendment.\n\nSeveral years after this decision, a young man named David Heller called me. He had been sued\nby a 60 year old fellow employee, Sylvia Smith Bowman, who was running for the presidency of\ntheir local union. Here is how the court described what Heller did:\n\n“[W Jhile the plaintiff was on an approved leave to campaign in the union election, the defendant,\nDavid Heller, an employee in the plaintiff's office who supported the incumbent president, created\ntwo distinct photocopied representations of the plaintiff by superimposing a photograph of her face\nand name on two different photographs of women striking lewd or masturbatory poses. The\nphotograph of the plaintiff's face was taken from a campaign card she had distributed to union\nmembers. The photographs on which the defendant superimposed the plaintiff's face were taken by\nthe defendant from pornographic magazines. In one of the photographs, the model is nude from the\nwaist down, except for garters, and is posed toward the camera with her legs wide apart as she\nholds a banana next to her exposed breast. In the other photograph, the model is entirely naked,\nand appears to be engaged in masturbation. The representations were crafted by the defendant\nduring regular office hours and reproduced on photocopiers owned by the department. The\ndefendant then distributed his handiwork to five coworkers in the Worcester office. Subsequently,\nthe representations were reproduced by employees other than the defendant and distributed to a\nwider office audience.”\n\nHeller said that he had decided to create these parodies after Bowman had made what he regarded\nas crude and sexist statements against men, including calling them “dickheads.”\n\nThe Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts eventually ruled, over a strong dissent, that\nBowman was not a “public figure” because the union election was not “a public controversy.”\nThe dissenting judges disagreed, arguing that “an election is the absolute paradigm of a public\ncontroversy.” My own view is that the majority, especially the woman who wrote the decision,\n\n151\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017238",
