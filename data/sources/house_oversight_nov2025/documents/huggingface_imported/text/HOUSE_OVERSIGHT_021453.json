  "text": "FBI: We still have\n\n> EPSTEIN fom 1B\n\nand Donald Trump among\nhis friends.\n\n“Highly unusual’ is how\nPalm Beach Police Chief Mi-\nchael Reiter described State\nAttorney Barry Krischer’s\nhandling of the case in a\nbluntly critical letter to\nKrischer last year before\nEpstein was indicted.\n\nReiter referred the mat-\n‘ter to the FBI to determine\nwhether any federal laws had\nbeen violated. Epstein’s allies\ncountered by attacking the\nchief personally and profes-\nsionally.\n\nReiter department in-\nvestigated Epstein for 11\nmonths. Police sifted repeat-\nedly through his trash and\nconducted surveillance on\nhis five-bedroom, 7-bath,\n7,234-square-foot home on\nthe Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nPolice said Epstein paid\nwomen and girls as young\nas 14 to give him erotic mas-\nsages at his home. Police\nthought there was probable\ncause to charge him with\nunlawful sex acts with a mi-\nnor and lewd and lascivious\nmolestation. ‘\n\nGg Epstein responded by\nwhiring a phalanx of lawyers.\n+ One of them, Harvard law\n2 professor and author Alan\n& Dershowitz, provided the\n+ state attorney's office with\ninformation about alcohol\nq and marijuana use by some\nSof the girls who said ‘they\n, were with Epstein.\n\n‘Prosecutors then referred\nthe case to the grand jury\n\nTeenage girls were\nrecruited to, visit.\nEpstein for massages\nand sex, police Say.\n\nrather than file’ charges di-\nrectly against Epstein.\nEpstein’s attorneys deny\nhe had sex with underage\ngirls. The lawyers say the\ngirls’ stories are not credible.\nBut if the court file is any\nindicator, they've made no ef\n\nfort to depose the girls.\nNeither prosecutors nor\ndefense attorneys have\n\nsought to question Robson,\nsaid Dutko, her attorney. She\nrecruited teenage girls to vis-\nit Epstein for massages and\nsexual activity, Palm Beach\npolice said, and presumably\nwould be a key witness.\n\nEpstein’s attorney Jack\nGoldberger did not return\nphone messages.\n\nA source close to the case\nsuggested it is languishing\npending a decision by the\nFBI on whether to refer it to\nfederal prosecutors.\n\n“We still have a pending\ncase,” FBI spokeswoman\n\n. Judy Orihuela said Monday.\n\nState Attorney Krischer\ndid not return a call for com-\nment. His spokesman, Mike\nEdmondson, declined to say\nwhether federal investiga-\ntors are delaying the Epstein\ncase. But, he added, “if an-\nother agency is looking at\nsomething, we wouldn’t want\nto step on their toes.”\n\na pending case:\n\nAttorneys say inertia in a\ncriminal case often points to\n\na pending plea deal.\n\n“It would not surprise me\nif something has happened\nthats not reflected in the\ncourt file,” said Dutko, such\nas an agreement that will be\nformalized later.\n\nDefense. attorney Marc\nShiner said defense  at-\ntorneys sometimes put off\novertly conducting discov-\nery — deposing witnesses,\nrequesting documents and\nthe like — because doing so.\n\ncreates more work for har\n\nried prosecutors who may\nbecome angry and not offer\napleadeal.\n\n“Sometimes defense law-\nyers, knowing that, will try\nand do discovery without\ntaking depositions,” said\nShiner, a former prosecutor\nfor 13 years.\n\nInstead, they may conduct\na below-the-radar probe such\nas having a private investiga-\ntor check out leads, he said.\n\nShiner and others say a\nplea deal for Epstein probably\nwould result in pretrial inter-\nvention, in which a defendant\nmay be ordered to undergo\na psychological evaluation,\ncounseling or other condi-\ntions in return for dropping\nthe charge.\n\nEdmondson, spokesman\nfor State Attorney Krischer,\nsaid there is no plea offer\nand no request for the pros-\necution to show its cards.\n\n“To my knowledge, it’s\nnever happened before on a\nfiled case,” he said.\n© larry_keller@pbpost.com\n\nEpstein\nMoney\nmanager in\nNew York has\npowerful allies,\n\n—\n\nan ©) mona, leh\nBe She Es ws ps\nBag Sze 8 8 SSN\nP58 EOS oe Ss\nEo 5 BO Ot tw 8 3\nae oses Bo »y WSs\nse Sa eases Seg og\n(Bhs beGeas | Ss\n28 x\nwee eeshasse | Rak\nstelSadets wa =\nS Eg 5 OE.
