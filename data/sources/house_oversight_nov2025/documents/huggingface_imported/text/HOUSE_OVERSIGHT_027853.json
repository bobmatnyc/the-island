  "text": "The challenge now, I told my exhausted team, was to make sure we were\nprepared for this new reality. Part of the spadework was already in place. Much\nas I’d hoped that Arafat and I could turn a new page in Middle East history, I\nhad directed our army chief-of-staff, nine months before the summit, to draw up\ncontingency plans for the likelihood of an unprecedentedly deadly eruption of\nPalestinian violence if we were to fail.\n\nNow, I felt we had to go even further, and to prepare a proactive alternative\nto the negotiated deal we’d been unable to secure. I proposed considering a\nunilateral Israeli pullout from the West Bank and Gaza. The territorial terms\nwould, necessarily, be less far-reaching than the proposal Arafat had rejected.\nBut I felt we should still withdraw from the great majority of the land we had\ncaptured in 1967, still leaving the Palestinians an area which the outside world\nwould recognize as wholly sufficient for them to establish a viable, successful\nstate.\n\nAnd crucially, this would finally give Israel, our country, a delineated, final\nborder with the territory captured in the Six-Day War.\n\nGili, clearly uneasy about accepting the idea that the chances for a negotiated\npeace were definitively gone, left to try to get some sleep on the long flight\nahead.

During\nthose years, nearly everything of significance which I did had happened after\nsundown. The commando operations were, of course, set for darkness whenever\npossible. The element of surprise could mean the difference between success\nand failure, indeed life and death. But all of my planning, all my thinking,\ntended to happen at night as well. The quiet, and the lack of distractions, helped\nto discipline my mind. I found that it helped to free my mind as well, sometimes\nonly to discover that it went off in unexpected directions.\n\nIt did so now. Perhaps even I was still reluctant to accept that Camp David\nmeant that the opportunity for a transformative deal with Arafat was finished.\nYet whatever the reason, I began thinking back to the first time that my path and\nhis had crossed. It was in the spring of 1968, nearly a year after Israel had\ndefeated the armies of our three main Arab enemies — Egypt, Syria and Jordan.\nIsraeli forces were advancing on a Jordanian town called Karameh, across the\n\n5\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027853",
