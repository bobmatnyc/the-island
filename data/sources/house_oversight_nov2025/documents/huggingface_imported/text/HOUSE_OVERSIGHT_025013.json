  "text": "17\n\nSPIEGEL: Many Arabs now feel that your institution is not very\nefficient.\n\nElaraby: The historic moment of change has gripped the entire\nregion, and sooner or later it will change all Arab countries. The\nLeague will certainly need to adjust to that. We must be capable of\nreacting quickly to unexpected developments.\n\nSPIEGEL: Surely there are a few member states, most notably Saudi\nArabia, which will hardly support such changes.\n\nElaraby: I too have my doubts there. Nevertheless, we still have to\ntry, and we have to take seriously the human rights established by the\nUN, which all countries in the League have recognized.\n\nSPIEGEL: How does Saudi Arabia's foreign minister explain that\nhis country supports the Syrian opposition, on the one hand, while at\nthe same time sending troops to Bahrain?\n\nElaraby: I don't ask him these questions. That's your job. You're the\njournalists.\n\nSPIEGEL: Do you support the Palestinian Autonomous Authority in\nits aspiration to have the UN General Assembly give its blessing in\nSeptember to the establishment of a State of Palestine?\n\nElaraby: UN Resolution 181, adopted in 1947, is the birth certificate\nfor two nations, Israel and Palestine. What's wrong with the\nPalestinians appealing directly to the UN after 20 years of\nnegotiations with Israel? They could spend another 20 years\nnegotiating without results, because the Israeli government doesn't\neven want to put an end to the conflict. The Israelis are only serious\nabout gaining more land and expanding the settlements.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025013",
