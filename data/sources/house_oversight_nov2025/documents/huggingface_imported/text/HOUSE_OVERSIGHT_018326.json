They should, Postel\nfelt, be good at handling lots of different types of communications - they should be\n“robust” — but they should also be careful not to spread too much non-standard\ngarbage out into the networks. This was an essential advance over the old ARPANET\nPaul Baran had helped inspire. That system worked wonderfully by itself, in\nisolation, as it sent humming nuclear launch codes zipping around, but it struggled\nwhen it needed to interoperate with other networks. It wasn’t generous. The\nInternet that Postel and others were designing was intended to be much, much\nlarger than ARPANET, so an ability to speak to others and be understood was\nessential. It was like planning an airport: You wanted to be able to land lots of\ndifferent types of planes. But if someone started throw golf balls, jello and gasoline\non the runway you'd have a problem. It would slow down the system for everyone.\nPostel was telling engineers: Be careful what you do and what you put onto the\nsystem. Take responsibility on your end. Build something that’s generous in what it\nwill handle from others.\n\nBe liberal in what you accept. From the first moments on the grass in Lelystad, the\nsmall town just outside Amsterdam where the Hacking At the End of the Universe\nconference gathered, the mad diversity that this idea suggested was an astonishing,\ndelightful fact. As broad and strange a group as Rop’s email had hinted might come\nwas in fact there, under the trees, happily running cables from tent to RV, powering\ntheir connected routers with gas-fired generators, marveling at data transmission\nspeeds that today, your phone might manage from an underground garage with the\nbarest connectivity. The two-day outdoor festival was an example of human\ninteroperability. Postel’s Principle brought to life. Few of us knew most of the group.\nNearly everyone was, well, not the most social. But there was instant connection,\ndiscussion, board gaming, and a degree of frank interoperating I’d never quite seen\nbefore. It was a harbinger of two decades of digital cross connection yet to come.\n\nOf all the people at the Hacktic conference, however, among the system managers\nand Unix gurus and heating system guerillas (hey, everyone should have a hobby), it\nwas the Warez Dudes who were of the most interest - both to the participants in the\nconference and to the white vans cruising nearby, allegedly filled with curious Dutch\npolice. The nickname came from the “wares” they had access to, which were largely\ncracked open versions of commercial software that could be shared and distributed\nand manipulated on private bulletin board systems. The Warez Dudes were pirates.\nAnd like most pirates they had an early sense of the very edges of the law and of the\nsmell of money drifting along new and essential routes. If hacker culture was, in\nthose early days, a frontier society - and it was, even down to the sad shortage of\nsingle women - these were the people living on the very furthest edges of the\n\n131 “Be conservative”: Jon Postel “DOD Standard Transmission Control Protocol”\n(1980) RFC 761, IED 129\n\n94\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018326",
