  "text": "Page 48 of 52\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, #917\n\nThe CVRA guarantees victims the right \"to be reasonably heard\" at \"any public proceeding ... involving release.\" 37° A\n\nsimilar right already exists for victims of stalking offenses. **” This proposed rule simply recognizes a victim's right \"to be\nreasonably heard\" and further directs the court to consider the victim's input. The victim's right to be heard would be\n\nmeaningless if the court did not consider the victim's views. Moreover, existing law appears to recognize that the court should\n\nconsider the victim's concerns. 328\n\nRule 48 - Victims' Views on Dismissal To Be Considered\nThe Proposal:\n\nThe court should be required to consider the views of victims in deciding whether to grant a government motion to dismiss\ncharges as follows:\n[#918]\n\nRule 48. Dismissal\n\n(a) By the Government. The government may, with leave of court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint. The\ngovernment may not dismiss the prosecution during trial without the defendant's consent. In deciding whether to grant the\ngovernment's motion to dismiss, the court shall consider the views of any victims.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThis proposed change would implement a victim's right to be \"treated with fairness\" and to be heard at any proceeding\n\"involving release\" of the defendant by requiring the court to consider the views of the victim before granting a government\nmotion to dismiss a charge. The rule already requires leave of court before a dismissal can be approved. In determining whether\nto grant leave, the court should consider whether dismissal is \"clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\" 32? Among the\nrelevant factors in making this public interest determination is whether the prosecution's motion to dismiss is motivated by\n\"animus towards the victim.\" 73° The proposed rule would simply require the court to consider the views of the victim in\nmaking this determination, leaving the weight to afford those views up to the court.\n\nRule 50 - Victims’ Right to Proceedings Free from Unreasonable Delay\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nA victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay should be recognized as follows:\nRule 50. Prompt Disposition\n\n(a) Scheduling Preference. Scheduling preference must be given to criminal proceedings as far as practicable.\n[*919]\n\n(b) Defendant's Right Against Delay. The court shall assure that the defendant's right to a speedy trial is protected, as provided\nby the Speedy Trial Act.\n\n326 18 U.S.C.A. 3771 (a)(4).\n320 18 UES. 2263)\n328 See, e.g., J8 U.S.C. 3142(c) (court to consider whether release of the defendant \"will endanger the safety of any other person\").\n\n329 United States v. Cowan, 524 F.2d 504, 513 (Sth Cir. 1975).\n\n330 In re Richards, 213 F.3d 773, 787 (3d Cir. 2000).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017762",
