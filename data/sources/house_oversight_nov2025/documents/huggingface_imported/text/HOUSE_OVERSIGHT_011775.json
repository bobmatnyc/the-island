  "text": "/ BARAK / 18\n\nsave himself: by suggesting a delay of 72 hours for talks on a “unity” government.\nI said that I was all for unity. But I reminded him that, time after time, we’d saved\nhis government in order to continue the peace process. We could no longer help\nout a “government that is not interested in upholding the Wye agreement, but only\nin its political survival.”\n\nThe vote of no-confidence went against him by the yawning margin of 81 to 30,\nwith nine Knesset members abstaining or staying away. A few days later, the date\nfor the election was announced: May 17, 1999.\n\n304\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011775",
