They monitored the comings and goings\nof its owner’s private jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his\ntrash.\n\nThe owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money\nmanager with several billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14-year-\nold girl told the Palm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later\nidentified as Mr. Epstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.\n\nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14-year-old and other teenage girls said a\nfriend had arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages,\nusually in their underwear, in exchange for cash.\n\nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated\nduring the massages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or\npenis. They identified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home.\nSome recalled that his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029419",
