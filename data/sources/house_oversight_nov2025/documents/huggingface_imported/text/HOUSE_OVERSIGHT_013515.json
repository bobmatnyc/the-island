  "text": "number could be expressed as the sum of at most four squared numbers. It was his\nstrongly held opinion that metaphysical speculation was both foreign and inimical to\nthe conduct of mathematics and science. His work in the ca/culus of variations led\nto the development of a system of algebraic manipulations seeking the value of\nconstants, Lagrange multipliers, in place of solving Euler’s differential equations. It\nmakes it possible to immediately write down a computable expression for the\nmaximum of a mathematical equation. The technique is now routinely taught to high\nschool students and with no mention of the role of belief in the perfection of God in\n\nits discovery.\n\n| was a fortunate freshman medical student. After a visit to his office and a\nstimulating discussion about some of the correspondences between the ideas of\npsychoanalysis and neurobiology, Robert Heath, Tulane Medical School’s Gary\nCooper-like charismatic chairman of the psychiatry department, offered me a place\nin his animal and human neurophysiological laboratory. Between classes, evenings\nand weekends, | used a Horsely-Clarke apparatus, one of the world’s first\nstereotaxic devices. It allowed the precise placement of electrodes into functionally\nspecific regions of a cat’s brain. The electrodes were cemented to the skull in place\nand their wires connected to a device by which the frequency, amplitude and wave\nshape of the electrical stimulation could be oscilloscopically monitored and\nelectronically controlled as the conscious cat walked around the room. | spent hours\nobserving and recording changes in spontaneous behavior that followed activation\nof various nuclei in the cat’s brain with small electrical currents.\n\nDeep in the part of brain that resides in the upper neck, called the lower brain\nstem, the region thought to regulate functions such as breathing, heart rate, blood\npressure, gastrointestinal motility and global states of consciousness such as\nwakefulness and sleep, | found stimulus sites that, after 15 seconds of electrical\nactivation, led to several minutes of hissing and objectless rage. One cat attacked\n\nan empty chair. These regions when activated also inhibited spinal reflexes such as\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013515",
