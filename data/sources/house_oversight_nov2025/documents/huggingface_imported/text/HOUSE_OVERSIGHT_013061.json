Generally speaking, one type of knowledge can be converted\nto another, at the cost of some loss of information. The synergy between cognitive processes\nassociated with corresponding pieces of knowledge, possessing different type, is a critical aspect\nof general intelligence.\n\nsynthesis or analysis is just too great, and the algorithms are unable to filter through all the\npossibilities, given the lack of intrinsic constraint that comes along with a “general intelligence”\ncontext (as opposed to a narrow-AI problem like chess-playing, where the context is constrained\nand hence restricts the scope of possible combinations that needs to be considered). In an AGI\narchitecture based on cognitive synergy, the different learning mechanisms must be designed\nspecifically to interact in such a way as to palliate each others’ combinatorial explosions - so\nthat, for instance, each learning mechanism dealing with a certain sort of knowledge, must\nsynergize with learning mechanisms dealing with the other sorts of knowledge, in a way that\ndecreases the severity of combinatorial explosion.\n\nOne prerequisite for cognitive synergy to work is that each learning mechanism must. rec-\nognize when it is “stuck,” meaning it’s in a situation where it has inadequate information to\nmake a confident judgment about what steps to take next. Then, when it does recognize that\nit’s stuck, it may request help from other, complementary cognitive mechanisms.\n\nA theoretical notion closely related to cognitive synergy is the cognitive schematic, formalized\nin Chapter 7 above, which states that the activity of the different cognitive processes involved\nin an intelligent system may be modeled in terms of the schematic implication\n\nContext \\ Procedure — Goal\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013061",
