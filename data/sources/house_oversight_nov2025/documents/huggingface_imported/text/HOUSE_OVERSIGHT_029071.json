  "text": "Harnwell: The third-largest conservative news website is something to be extremely\nimpressed by. Can you tell for the people here who aren’t within the Anglosphere and they\nmight not follow American domestic politics at the moment — there seems to bea\nsubstantial sea change going on at the moment in Middle America. And the leader of the\nmajority party, Eric Cantor, was deselected a couple of weeks ago by a tea party\ncandidate. What does that mean for the state of domestic politics in America at the\nmoment?\n\nBannon: For everybody in your audience, this is one of the most monumental — first off,\nit’s the biggest election upset in the history of the American republic. Eric Cantor was the\nHouse majority leader and raised $10 million. He spent, between himself and outside\ngroups, $8 million to hold a congressional district. He ran against a professor who was an\nevangelical Christian and a libertarian economist. He ran against a professor who raised\nin total $175,000. In fact, the bills from Eric Cantor’s campaign at a elite steak house in\nWashington, DC, was over $200,000. So they spent more than $200,000 over the course\nof the campaign wining and dining fat cats at a steak house in Washington than the entire\n\nopposition had to run.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029071",
