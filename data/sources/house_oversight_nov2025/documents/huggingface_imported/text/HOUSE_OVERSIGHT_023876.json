  "text": "130 Teaching Minds\n\nChildren normally make judgments about the behavior of their\nparents and friends as well. In all these cases, judgment is best taught\nby having a student watch the behavior of others, keeping himself out\nof the issue and seeing what factors motivated and determined the\nbehavior of the actors. It is a lot easier to teach proper behavior when\nit is not one’s own behavior that is being judged. One can learn to act\nby judging how others act.\n\nSo, children make judgments all the time. Typically those judg-\nments reflect the values that they have been taught at home. Children\ndecide what is good and what is bad mostly based on what they have\nbeen told. No child discovers for himself that George Washington was\nan admirable man. No child decides on his own that the United States\nis the best country in the world. These things are taught by parents\nand by schools. School, to the extent that it serves as a place of in-\ndoctrination, has always succeeded at producing citizens who believe\nwhat they are taught to believe at a young age. There obviously is a\ngreat deal of sentiment for keeping indoctrination as a key part of\neducation, but teaching judgment means allowing children to come\nto conclusions based on their own experience and not merely what\nthey were told.\n\nLearning to make judgments is a process of deciding for oneself\nwhat is true, which is, of course, not so easy. This should be the role of\nschool but it usually isn’t. School wants to teach us the truth when, in\nfact, truth is best discovered, again, from experience.\n\nHow would one discover the “best country in the world,” if that\nis a meaningful idea, or whether George Washington was all he was\ncracked up to be? Obviously, travel helps teach one about countries.\nKids can learn about countries by simulated travel in the modern era.\nBut the point wouldn’t be so much to teach them that they make good\ncheese in France, which is the kind of thing school does today, but to\nthink about what makes France different from the United States. Simi-\nlarly, we can read and learn some facts about George Washington, and\nthese are indeed taught to children in primary school. I do not believe\nthat children are equipped at a young age to determine for themselves\nwhether Washington was a good man. Perhaps that would be a worth-\nwhile assignment in high school, as long as students were interested\nin the question and were allowed to come to any conclusion that they\ncould reasonably defend. But children of 5 or 6 can understand what\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023876",
