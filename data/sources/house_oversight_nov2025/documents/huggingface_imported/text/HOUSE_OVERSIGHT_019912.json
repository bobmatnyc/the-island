  "text": "connected to Russian intelligence, Steele assembled a damaging report—now dubbed the\n“dossier’—suggesting that Donald Trump was being blackmailed by the Putin\ngovernment. In September, Steele briefed reporters from the New York Times, the\nWashington Post, Yahoo! News, the New Yorker, and CNN. All declined to use this\nunverified information, with its unclear provenance, especially given that it was about an\nunlikely election winner.\n\nBut the day before the scheduled press conference, CNN broke details of the Steele\ndossier. Almost immediately thereafter, Buzzfeed published the entire report—an itemized\nbacchanal of beyond-the-pale behavior.\n\nOn the verge of Trump’s ascendancy to the presidency, the media, with its singular\nvoice on Trump matters, was propounding a conspiracy of vast proportions. The theory,\nsuddenly presented as just this side of a likelihood, was that the Russians had suborned\nDonald Trump during a trip to Moscow with a crude blackmail scheme involving\nprostitutes and videotaped sexual acts pushing new boundaries of deviance (including\n“golden showers”) with prostitutes and videotaped sex acts. The implicit conclusion: a\ncompromised Trump had conspired with the Russians to steal the election and to install\nhim in the White House as Putin’s dupe.\n\nIf this was true, then the nation stood at one of the most extraordinary moments in the\nhistory of democracy, international relations, and journalism.\n\nIf it was not true—and it was hard to fathom a middle ground—then it would seem to\nsupport the Trump view (and the Bannon view) that the media, in also quite a dramatic\ndevelopment in the history of democracy, was so blinded by an abhorrence and revulsion,\nboth ideological and personal, for the democratically elected leader that it would pursue\nany avenue to take him down. Mark Hemingway, in the conservative, but anti-Trump,\nWeekly Standard, argued the novel paradox of two unreliable narrators dominating\nAmerican public life: the president-elect spoke with little information and frequently no\nfactual basis, while “the frame the media has chosen to embrace 1s that everything the man\ndoes is, by default, unconstitutional or an abuse of power.”\n\nOn the afternoon of January 11, these two opposing perceptions faced off in the lobby\nof Trump Tower: the political antichrist, a figure of dark but buffoonish scandal, in the\npocket of America’s epochal adversary, versus the would-be revolutionary-mob media,\ndrunk on virtue, certainty, and conspiracy theories. Each represented, for the other side, a\nwholly discredited “fake” version of reality.\n\nIf these character notes seemed comic-book in style, that was exactly how the press\nconference unfolded.\n\nFirst Trump’s encomiums to himself:\n\n“I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created... .”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019912",
