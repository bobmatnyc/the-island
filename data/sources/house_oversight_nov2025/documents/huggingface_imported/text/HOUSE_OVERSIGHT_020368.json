  "text": "216\n\nbefore departing to Moscow, and Assange accommodated him by laying down a smoke screen of\ndecoy flights to facilitate his escape from Hong Kong and sending him a helper.\n\nTaken together, these actions show that Snowden was determined to succeed where others\nbefore him had failed. He not only wanted to take full credit for stealing files from the NSA but\nhe wanted to escape any American retribution for his act. His decision suggests to me a highly-\nintelligent, carefully calculating man who was hell-bent on finding a new life for himself in a\nforeign country. There is a common thread that runs through these four choices. It is a\nwillingness to do whatever was necessary to achieve this new life, including disregarding his oath\nto protect secrets and instead transporting them on thumb drives to a foreign country. To protect\nhimself, he was also willing to rely on the influence of an adversary intelligence services in Hong\nKong and put himself of the hands of Russian authorities in Moscow. He also was willing to use\nsome of his classified documents as a medium of exchange, if not bait, with journalist to get the\npublic attention he sought. These choices paid off for him. The video presentation he partly\nauthored changed his status in the eyes of the public from a document-stealer to whistle blower.\nAgainst all odds, Snowden succeeded in transforming himself from a low-level computer\ntechnician working, without any public recognition at the NSA into an internationally-acclaimed\nspokesman against the NSA’s surveillance. And in Moscow, he could enjoy a safe life, free from\nthe threats of a CIA rendition team dropping from the sky or extradition proceedings. He was\nnow under the protection of Putin’s Russia. As far as Snowden was concerned, as he told\nGellman of the Washington Post on December 21, 2013 in Moscow, “The mission’s already\naccomplished.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020368",
