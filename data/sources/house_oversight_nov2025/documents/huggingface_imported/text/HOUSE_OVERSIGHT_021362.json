  "text": "congregants’ interior emotional world by\nmodeling the self on God, or on the self\nas seen from God’s loving perspective.\nOne of the most important was prayer\nministry, where the person for whom the\nprayer is given is often crying and in\nvisible pain; those around the person are\noffering prayers which describe the ways\nin which the sobbing person is loved by\nGod. Another was treating prayer like a\npsychotherapy session. One congregant\nexplained: “It’s just like talking to a\ntherapist, especially in the beginning\nwhen you’re revealing things that are\ndeep in your heart and deep in your soul,\nthe things that have been pushed down\nand denied.” In these churches which\nemphasize God’s love and intimacy, hell\nand fear largely disappear.\n\nThe central demand of these\nlearning practices is to use one’s own\nmental experience as evidence and\ncontent for the responsive presence of\nthis God, who is believed to be other\nthan oneself, and to use pretend play to\nintegrate those mental events into a\nrepresentation that is persuasively\nexternal to the self. The emotional\npractices provide both direct evidence of\nGod’s love and, more generally,\nevidence that participation in church is\nsatisfying and worthwhile. In effect the\nprocess asks the congregants to carve\nGod out of their own experience and to\nexperience those phenomena as other;\nand it uses the emotional practices taught\nby the church and the social world of the\ncongregation to help them hold that God\nseparate and apart and lovingly\nresponsive.\n\nThis is hard work to do, and not\neveryone was able to do it, or to do it\neasily. Here two congregants describe\ntheir difficulty in experiencing God\ndirectly despite their efforts.\n\nPage | 116\n\nJake: “I remember desperately wanting\nto draw closer to God, and [to have] one\nof these inspired Holy Spirit moments ...\nI wanted those [experiences] and I\nsought them out, but I never found\nmyself encountering them”\n\nIrene: “I don’t understand the gift of\nprophecy completely. I’ll probably\nnever will and I don’t have it and I don’t\nwant it because it would scare me.”\n\nHere is another congregant who has been\nable to do so:\n\nNora: “It was pretty early on in my\nrelationship with him. I was just all full\nof myself one morning. I just had\nwonderful devotions and worships and\njust felt so close. I went out, and it was\nthe most god-awful day. It was icy rain\nand gray and cold and it was sleeting.\nI’m just full of the joy of the Lord, and I\nsay, “God, I praise you that it isn’t\nsnowing, and that nothing’s\naccumulating, and that the streets aren’t\nicy’—and then I went around the corner,\nand I hit a patch of ice, and just about\nwent down. It was so funny to me. I just\nburst out laughing out loud. It was just\nso funny that he would put me in my\nplace in such a slapstick personal kind of\nway. But then he just graced me the rest\nof the morning. The bus showed up right\naway, which it never does. I was\nreading, and I missed my stop to get off,\nand I heard God say, “Get off the bus.” I\nlooked up and hollered, and the bus\nactually stopped, half a block on, to let\nme get off. I just felt that intimacy all\nmorning. Like when you go from\nholding a new boyfriend’s hand to\nkissing him goodnight ....”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021362",
