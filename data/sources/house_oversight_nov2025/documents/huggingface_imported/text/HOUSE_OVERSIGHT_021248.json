  "text": "Invisible Forces and Unseen Powers:\nGravity, Gods, and Minds\n\nPreface\n\n1. Invisible Forces Operating on Human\nBodies\n\nGravity is an invisible force that holds us\nto the surface of the earth, and the fact\nthat gravity is invisible does not place it\nbeyond scientific scrutiny. Similarly,\nhumans are a quintessentially social\nspecies whose need for social connection\nproduces invisible forces on our brain,\nbehavior, and biology that are subject to\nscientific investigation. Among these are\nforces that compel us to seek trusting and\nmeaningful connections with others and\nto seek meaning and connection with\nsomething bigger than ourselves. The\nstory of these invisible forces speaks to\nwho we are as a species.\n\nFrom Selfish Genes to Social Brains\n\n2. The Social Nature of Humankind\nThe human brain has evolved under the\nguidance of selfish genes to produce\nmore than a brain that is capable of\npowerful, isolated information\nprocessing operations. The human brain\nalso evolved with inherent capacities for\nsocial cognition, compassion, empathy,\nbonding, coordination, cooperation,\nvalues, mortality and a need for social\nconnection that extends beyond kin and\neven other mdividuals.\n\nFrom Inclusive Fitness to Spiritual\nStriving\n\n3. Science, Religion, and a Revised\n\nReligious Humanism\nThe dialogue between science and\nreligion, if properly pursued, can usher in\na new era of religious humanism in the\nleading world religions. Their central\nbeliefs and practices largely would\nremain intact, but their views of nature\nand their concerns with health and well-\nbeing would be refined through their\nconversations with the sciences. How\n\nthis model would work is discussed in\nterms of the relation between love and\nhealth in Christian theology — especially\nthe tension between the agape, caritas,\nand eros models of Christian love.\n\nThe Status of the Body Politic and the\nStatus of the Body Itself\n\n4. Health by Connection: From Social\n\nBrains to Resilient Bodies\nMost people feel socially connected most\nof the time. Felt connectedness is\ntypically taken for granted, but the\neffects of its absence, as experienced in\nfeelings of isolation, demonstrate that\nour evolutionary heritage as a social\nspecies has potent implications for health\nand well-being.\n\nFrom Relationships to People and\nGroups to Relationships with God\n\n5. Psychosomatic Relations: From\n\nSuperstition to Mortality\nIt has long been recognized that mental\nstates can impact health and well being,\nbut the causal pathways have only\nrecently begun to be understood.\nThoughts, beliefs and attitudes can have\npowerful effects on physiological\nfunctions, health and disease. Examples\nrange from superstitious beliefs\nassociated with voodoo, bone pointing,\nor other black rituals to the more positive\nstates associated with spirituality. The\npresent essay considers these disparate\npsychological states and how they might\ntranslate into physiological effects\nhaving real health implications.\n\nThe Mind and Body Are One\n\n6. The Suspension of Individual\nConsciousness and the Dissolution of\nSelf and Other Boundaries\n\nA special case of social interaction\nconcerns two or more individuals\nengaging in temporally coordinated\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021248",
