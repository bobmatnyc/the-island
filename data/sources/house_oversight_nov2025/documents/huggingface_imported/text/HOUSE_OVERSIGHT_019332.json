The generous contribution you\nmade last year to Verse Video Education is now in use (we've hired our new editor!). Once he helps\nus to plow through the work of this year, we'll begin to look forward to crafting educational content on\nthe literature of art, sport and play (these materials now including footage from recent shoots with\nShaquille O'Neal, Yo Yo Ma, Cynthia Nixon, Bono and others). 100K makes so much possible.\n\nBut, of course, you've also been a key preceptor as I've learned how --squirming all the way--the\nsausage really gets made in public television. | can't say I've been entirely successful in taming costs\nthere, but I've been far better armed and more mindful of what they should be after the stern tutorial\nyou administered.\n\nWhenever Templeton might be ready to evaluate another application, I'm ready for another proposal\nfor them. | wonder if you might arrange a meeting for me with the famous Barnaby? | can't yet afford\na grant writer, and so the time one of these suckers takes makes me think doing more advance\nreconnaissance is crucial. Would he meet with me? Kosher? I'd also love to meet with the Blacks as\n| get closer to making content on theatre. | hope that Debra is well.\n\nAnd heard there's another little Jeff in the caribbean...\nBest,\n\nElisa New\n\nPowell M.
