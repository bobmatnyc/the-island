  "text": "In our own age, a fundamental conflict lingers as well. This is the struggle between\nindividual liberty and connection. We have to ask a version of Hayek’s question: Are\nwe happier, better off, more justly fulfilled through ceaseless linkage to the fast\nsystems all around us? The appeal of constant connection is not a mere economic\nfact. It’s become a feature our personalities and psychologies and even the\nbiochemistry of our brains. To be disconnected, in so many senses, hurts. And while\nthe human twitch for freedom remains as alive as a protection for us all, Hayek's\nsecond safety catch is eroding. Networks of deep connection, speed and intelligence\nwill be powerfully more efficient than central planning; they know more than any\ncentral bureacrat might have. And they may yet be even more productive at times in\ntheir connection and intelligence than our existing structures or markets or\nelectoral systems. Think of the way centralized, linked dispatch systems make a\n“sharing” economy of on-demand cars and rooms available in ways the market itself\ncould not. Similar alluring evolutions lie ahead in medicine, in finance, in politics.\nThe temptation to throw all in for some sort of technological political fusion, one\nthat promises better returns on our time and money in exchange for our liberty, will\ngrow. When we depend so much on connection for our identity, our work, and our\nsafety how far from John Stuart Mill’s line from On Liberty might we tread: “Over\nhimself, over his own body and mind, the individual is sovereign.”34+ Are we\nsovereign over our own bodies and minds? Over the machines? This is nota puzzle\ntoday’s power class can or should touch. They may accidentally lead us to disaster.\nHayek’s fear, that in pursuing one end (freedom) leaders would secure its opposite\n(tyranny), is what we should share. The tools of the network age are ripe for misuse.\nIn some senses, they are built for misuse: They are opaque. They are blindingly fast.\nThey seduce and enmesh us with their new power. They demand, as a result, new\nsensibility for their final control.\n\nThere are many ways we will explore the Seventh Sense. The rise and fall of startup\ntechnology companies or terror groups or epidemics will lead us. We will examine,\ncarefully, the tensions of a network age to understand where the cracks are coming\nfrom, and where new ideas are emerging. But I’m trying at least to write a bit with\nthat challenge of Master Nan in mind. If we are, really, facing an ephochal change\nthen we should handle the problems of our era with particular care; we should\nstudy the opportunities with real urgency. Two hundred years from now when the\ngreat companies and billionaires and revolutionaries of our age are crushed down\nbelow the horizon of history, it is the massive movements of states and populations\nthat will remain, with their awful or wondrous traces. Will we live in an age of war\nor peace?\n\nIs that something we can actually decide?\n\n34 When we depend so much: John Stuart Mill, On Liberty and the Subjugation of\nWomen, (New York: Penguin Classics 2007) 19.\n\n33\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018265",
