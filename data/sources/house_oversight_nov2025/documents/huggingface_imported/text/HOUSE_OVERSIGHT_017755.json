Rev. 835, *904\n\n[*905] without proper notice to a victim only if doing so is in the interest of justice, the court provides prompt notice to that\nvictim of the court's action and of the victim's right to seek reconsideration of the action if a victim's right is affected, and the\ncourt ensures that notice will be properly provided to that victim for all subsequent public proceedings.\n\n(c) Numerous Victims. If the court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the right\nto be present, the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to facilitate victims’ attendance.\n\n(d) Right To Be Heard on Victims’ Issues. In addition to rights to be heard established elsewhere in these rules, at any public\nproceeding at which a victim has the right to attend, the victim has the right to be heard on any matter directly affecting a\nvictim's right.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe rules should reflect the CVRA's command that victims have the right to attend public proceedings in all but the most\nunusual circumstances. The CVRA guarantees victims the right to attend a proceeding “unless the court, after recetving clear\nand convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other\ntestimony at that proceeding.\" 777 This is a fundamental right for victims. A crime is often a very significant event in the life of\na victim, and the trial, too, may be extremely important. Victims deserve to see in person whether justice is being done and\nshould be exempted from the rule requiring trial witnesses to sit outside the courtroom. 7/8 The CVRA adopts this approach by\n\nallowing crime victims, in the vast majority of cases, to attend the hearings and trial of the case involving their victimization.\nThis is so important because crime victims share an interest with the [*906] government in seeing that justice is done in a\ncriminal case and this interest supports the idea that victims should not be excluded from public criminal proceedings, whether\n\nthese are pretrial, trial, or post-trial proceedings. 77°\n\nMost states have also adopted language affirming a victim's right to attend court proceedings, including the trial. 75°\n\nOne way of addressing the victim's right to attend would be to leave the matter to the Federal Rules of Evidence. Federal Rule\nof Evidence 615 - the so-called \"rule on witnesses\" - requires exclusion of witnesses with certain exceptions, including the\n\nfourth exception for \"a person authorized by statute to be present.\" 75! This exception was added to cover crime victims, 78?\n\n277 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(3) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n\n278 See generally President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, Final Report 80 (1982) (urging that victims be able to attend trial); Douglas E.\nBeloof & Paul G. Cassell, The Victim's Right To Attend the Trial: The Reascendant National Consensus, 9 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 481 (2005)\n(developing this argument at length).\n\n279 150 Cong. Rec. S4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n\n280 See, e.g., Ariz. Const. art. II, 2.1(A) (\"To preserve and protect victims' rights to justice and due process, a victim of crime has a right: ...\nto be present at and, upon request, to be informed of all criminal proceedings where the defendant has the right to be present.\"); Colo. Const.\nart. II, 16a (\"Any person who is a victim of a criminal act, or such person's designee, legal guardian, or surviving immediate family members\nif such person is deceased, shall have the right to be heard when relevant, informed, and present at all critical stages of the criminal justice\nprocess.\" (emphasis added)); Idaho Const. art. I, 22 (\"A crime victim, as defined by statute, has the following rights: ... (4) to be present at all\ncriminal justice proceedings ... .\") (emphasis added); La. Const. art. I, 25 (\"As defined by law, a victim of crime shall have the right to ... be\npresent ... during all critical stages of preconviction ... proceedings ... .\" (emphasis added)); Mich. Const. art. I, 24 (\"Crime victims ... shall\nhave the following rights ... The right to attend trial and all other court proceedings the accused has the right to attend.\" (emphasis added));\nMiss. Const.

I, 32 (\"Crime victims, as defined by law, shall have the following rights ... (1) the right to be\npresent at all criminal justice proceedings at which the defendant has such right ... .\" (emphasis added)); Miss. Code Ann. 99-43-21 (2000)\n(\"The victim has the right to be present throughout all criminal proceedings as defined in Section 99-43-1.\" (emphasis added)).
