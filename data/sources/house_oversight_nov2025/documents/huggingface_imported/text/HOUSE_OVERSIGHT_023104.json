  "text": "White Collar Titan Reid Weingarten on Juries Clients and the Scariest Federal Prosecutor... Page 3 of 5\n\nmuch oil was coming out of the hole after the explosion. BP had pleaded guilty to the very\nsame conduct and paid $4 billion. That was not a positive piece.\n\n| was told by everybody that BP was loathed in New Orleans. So now | have to pick a jury in\nNew Orleans for the very same conduct the company pleaded guilty to. And BP had paid a\nzillion dollars to every fisherman and stripper in New Orleans who claimed the spill\nprevented them from earning a living. But now, BP was getting pissed off that they were\ngetting ripped off, and were pulling back. In addition to being hated for killing all the pelicans\nand ruining tourism and fishing, now they’re pulling back on their largesse.\n\nSo | have to pick a jury. We had all the consultants you can imagine. The common wisdom\nwas, don’t pick anybody close to the gulf, because anyone close to the explosion will hate\nBP, and don’t take African-Americans because they hate fancy white lawyers from\nWashington, blah blah blah.\n\n| picked a jury and | did exactly the opposite, because my gut was that a sophisticated\nperson near the water who is familiar with the industry will appreciate how difficult it is to drill\nthese wells. If you have 100 deep sea wells in the gulf, every once in a while, you’re going to\nhave an accident.\n\nAnd there’s no reason to assume that the rest of the population, no matter what their\nbackground or color, wouldn’t strive to be fair. | also thought | had the upper hand in that |\ndidn’t think my client was guilty of anything, so | went against the grain.\n\nYou have standard thinking among most defense counsel on jury selection, and this is an\ninstance where | threw it out, and the jury came back in about two seconds and acquitted. |\nwas lucky and right.\n\nIt’s interesting to see who wants the smart jurors. Sometimes prosecutors want the smart\njurors, sometimes | want the smart jurors. That is an indication of who thinks they have the\nrighteous case. When prosecutors are striking all the lawyers and accountants and college-\neducated people, and—in New York City this happens—they want doormen and bus drivers,\nwhat they want is to rely on visceral hatred for the target and also a visceral reliance on\nUncle Sam, as opposed to the facts.\n\nWhen that happens, | want to blow my brains out, because that’s not how prosecutors\nshould behave. Prosecutors always should have the righteous case, and it should only be\ncrafty defense attorneys who want to obscure the facts. When | want the smart jurors\nbecause | think | have a righteous case, that case never should have been brought.\n\nThese days | find that to be the case many times.\nLD: How do you prepare for court? Do you rehearse what you’re going to say?\n\nRW: | can’t prepare that way. There are clients who say, \"| want to hear your opening before\nyou make it.\" | say, \"Get another lawyer.\"\n\nThis is not good or bad, it’s just Reid. | can’t say the same thing twice, and | cannot read a\nspeech. It’s not how | work with information.\n\nhttp://www litigationdaily.com/printerfriendly/id=1202736534962 9/8/2015\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023104",
