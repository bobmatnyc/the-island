I had also\nasked for all of the information regarding\ncommunications with Rebecca, which I was told\nthat I would get today. Is that available?\n\nMR. SCOTT: No. I told you that we would\nconsider if that -- I apologize. I said we will\nconsider that and you can put it in a request and\nwe will respond.\n\nTHE WITNESS: I would sure like to see that\nbefore I answer any more questions. Is that\nsomething you could make available?\n\nMR. SIMPSON: I don't think that's necessary\nto answer the questions I'm going to ask. I'm\nnot going to ask you any questions -- I won't ask\nyou any questions about Professor Dershowitz's\ncommunications with this Rebecca that you've\nheard about. You were in the room while he\ntestified, correct?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Right, but I mean there are --\nthere are broader subjects that extend beyond\nthose communications, so if you're going to ask\nany questions about those broader subjects, I\nwould like to see the communications. That would\n\nbe helpful to me.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021832",
