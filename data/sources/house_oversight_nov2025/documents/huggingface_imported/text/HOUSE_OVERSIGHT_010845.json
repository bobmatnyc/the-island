SIMPSON:\n\nQ. -- Professor Dershowitz?\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Sorry. I will let you finish.\n\nI'm objecting to this. I think it gets into\nthe substance of conversations under the\ncommon-interest privilege, whether there was a\nconversation, but you're getting into the\nsubstance of what the conversation was about, and\nI think that is a violation of her -- her\nprivilege.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: And just so that I can clarify\nour position on the record, I think that we can\nidentify the general subject matter in order to\nsupport our position that it falls within the\ncommon-interest privilege. So we are willing to\nanswer the question about the general subject\nmatter to support our assertion of\ncommon-interest privilege, but not get into the\nsubstance of the communications beyond that.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n00:14:54\n\n00:14:54\n\n00:14:57\n\n00:14:59\n\n00:15:04\n\n00:15:04\n\n00:15:06\n\nON Oar OND =\n\n00:15:07\n\noo\n\n00:45:08\n\ncots10 10\ncote: 114\nots 12\ncots 13\noorsis 14\ncorsa 15\noo1s21 16\n00:15:25 17\n001528 18\n0018.28 19\n00:15:31 20\noo-1s:31 24\n00:18:34 22\n001837 23\nontsa2 24\nootsse 25\n\n169\nMR.
