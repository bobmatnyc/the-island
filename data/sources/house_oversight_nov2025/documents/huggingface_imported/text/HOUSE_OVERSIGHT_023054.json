  "text": "From: J [jeevacation@gmail.com]\nSent: 2/1/2019 10:18:27 AM\nTo: jeffrey epstein [jeevacation@ gmail.com]\n\nImportance: — High\n\nprostittion isastate crime. never before a man in his own house charged with soliciting.! in Florida first\noffenders are required to take a sex ed class and get pre trial diversion. no criminal record... there isa\nfelony solication for the THIRD offense.. A grand jury was held and they found me guilty of one count of\nfelony solitciation . because there were many girls. . mandatory diversion. sentence..!!!!. a grand jury\n\n. ususally only for capital murder cases. . Recarey and Reiter ( police chief). pulled my garbage for months,\nand surveilled the house . letting all the gilrs come and go?! called inthe FBI. they did not like the grand\njury result. and released to the press, the raw sewage of police interviews , ie, no girl was cross examined\nEVER. . Unheardof. . - the girls retunred the house multiplie times. for 200 dollars for a rub and\n\ntug. . no sex. . some worked in the locak massage parlors. most in thier mid twenties.. There is only\npress stories told my strippers of me buying my girlfiedn from slovakia from her parents . girls under\n\n15. . all made up to get press.._ FBI / puts a task force together title \" operation leap year \" to investigate\nmy personal massage activity?! nuts. interviews my chiropractor? medical info. . etc.\n\nEy orked at Mara Lago. Trump knew of it. and came to my house many times during that\n\nperiod. The testimony of the houseman John allessi confiremed it. He never got a massage.\nabe gosman a friend of mine . ran into financial difficulty with assited living homes. . His home was listed\nat 45 million dollars. with no takers for months on end . He and J agreed a price of 30m. ( His wife lynn .\nends up going to jail for lying to the bankrupty trustee about her jewelry. ) this is in the summer of 04.. I\nbecame the stalking horse bidder at 36 m. ie if someone bid higher I would receive a fee.\ntrump buys the house at the telephone auction. only me trump andd his friend pulty the developer.\nHe quickly puts it on the market for 125 million. serves the purpose of a justification for a high sale later\n\n. and no one will touch it. it is is bough in the name of trump properties IIc... no idea who owns it. or\nwhat else it\" owns \".\nThree years later 08 he sells it to Ryboloolev for approx 100 million. He should have had a 50 million plus\ncapital gain. he tells people and press he spent 20-30 m to fix up. that would justifiy a reduction in captial\ngains. key question how did he report the sale , if he did at all on his 08 tax return.\nHe has no money. when he buys the house. His biz model is putting his name on a real estate development and\ngets a fee for using his name. The hotel biz is just that. someone else buys the hotel. hoping to make a profit\nfrom its operation and eventual sale. Trump put his name on it , and get a 2 % fee and maybe a piece of the\nprofit if any on sale. He touts the project as\" his\" .... just as in his current financial statements on file as\npresident he lists his\" income\" as the GROSS receipts of the clubs. with no expenses deducted. not his\npersonal revenue. ie the doral golf club loses money every year. it pays out more than it takes in , but he lists\nthe revenue as his income. AMAZING.\n\n\"Trump’s relationship with Deutsche Bank has not always been amicable; in November 2008, he had difficulty\nmaking payments on a $640 million Deutsch Bank loan — $40 million of which he guaranteed personally — he\ntook out to finance the construction of the Trump tower in Chicago.”\nhttps://themoscowproject.org/collusion/trump-sues-deutsche-bank-3-billion/\n\nin july , miraculously , rybololev ve buys the house for roughly the same\" 40 plus million dollar\" profit \"\n\nhttps://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/08/24/the-russian-diplomat-found-dead-in-his-\n\nool-in-sudan-is-the-seventh-to-die-since-november/?utm term=.77b0a287fb1l 1\n\nJoe Recarey dies injune of 18. same m.o. ?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023054",
