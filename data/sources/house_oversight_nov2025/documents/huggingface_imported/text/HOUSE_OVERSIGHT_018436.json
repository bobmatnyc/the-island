  "text": "Wittenberg church, in the American and French revolutions, in the silent fatal\ncracking of Ghandi’s India and Mandela’s South Africa.\n\nWe know that no political system that doesn’t match the power distribution of the\nsociety it governs can endure. Feudal order could not survive the pressures of\nliberty. Can democracy withstand the pressures of enmeshment, of massive\nconcentration of power, of artificial intelligences. Or will the slow, inefficient\nreaction time of popular voting prove finally unequal to the complexity ahead of us\nor too easy to manipulate? Writing of the Enlightenment, the historian Leon-Michel\nGambetta once explained that the goal of politics in the age of liberation and\nquestioning was, “to derive the political and social system from the idea of reason\nrather than that of grace.” What to do now? In a world where we may need to derive\na political system girded by tools of Al or wired by fast-moving and emergent\nnetworks, that can’t quite be derived from reason? What will the goal of politics be\nthen? When the first AI runs for President on a ticket of pure efficacy? Or perhaps\nDemocratic and Reblican candidates will debate who has the best AI. How will you\nvote?\n\nWe need already to reevaluate the idea of citizenship. What is it for? And the state\ntoo. To fit these roles into an age of liberation took centuries after Luther began the\nreformation; we may have but decades to decide what they mean in an age of\nenmsemhment. Does setting geographic and age criteria for voting still make sense?\nOne man one vote? Is there a better system to deal with complex issues? The\neconomists Daron Aceomoglu and James Robinson, in their magestirial study Why\nNations Fail marked success or collapse by these lines: Countries with “inclusive”\ninstitutions which guarded both elites and society at large have historically fared\nbetter than those (think of Russia or Latin America) that ran on “extractive” urges,\nnations machined to secure the profits and serenity of the elites alone. But where to\nfit our gated world into such an analysis, an era in which linked institutions benefit\nboth the gated and gatekeeper? Would you say such a system was extractive as it\nsucks our data and habits and secrets into massive, opaque finance or machine\nlearning systems? Or inclusive because, after all, we’re enmeshed in a web of newly\nfound linked wealth: time, health, finance, information, security. Networks in so\nmany ways insist on fresh considerations of power. What sorts of network design is\nlikely to be most effective, most legitimate? Kant’s famous question of the 1780s -\n“What is Enlightenment?” - is one we've not yet perfectly answered or resolved. The\nnew puzzle of “What is Enmeshment” is one we're only beginning to consider now.\nIt too will take lifetimes to answer, and the debate will be decied in the collision of\nideas and institutions we can’t even dream of today with the structures of power\nthat tower around us now.\n\nAt least we can see already that we'll need new ways to consider our future political\norder, mashed through as it will be by connection, machines and hot human hopes\nand fears. We'll certainly face our own turning points as our institutions collapse or\ncalcify or (hopefully) redesign themselves in some modern version of Britain’s\nbloodless 1688 Glorious Revolution, that ineffable moment when parliamentary\n\n204\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018436",
