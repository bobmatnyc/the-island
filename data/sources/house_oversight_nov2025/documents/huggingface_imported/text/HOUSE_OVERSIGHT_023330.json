  "text": "tax planing running out of time. .7 restructure office. barry? brad told me he thought you had\nacknowledged high value this year. gift tax audit etc., . April, Oct. . returns. manage joslin , who is still\nrunning your tax dept .\n\nyou and I need not rehash old postures, its tedious - I would ask that you tell me if you intend to pay for the\nwork that was done, and for the work you expect to be done, . thanks\n\nDate: Tue, Nov 15, 2016 at 12:13 PM\n\nSubject: Fwd:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinell\n\nLeon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but Im encouraged and glad for\nyou. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before\nhim. what would you like me to tell Barry?\n\nThere is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i\noutlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you\nlike ). Brad wechsler was never up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a\nlong time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and\nTom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2\npeople. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes i personally augmented his comp in order to get\nhim ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, | He complained for over a year , re his\ndirection by eileen and ada , and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of\nwarnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told\nyou he rarely failed to remind me in our conversations that you told him that he works for you and not for\nme and that brad needs to pays him .\n\n. Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. :\n\nI have taken heat for years over the fact that 1 gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up\n\nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. (that was Eileen _) but\nsomehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . _ when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the task, you\nbellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by trying to protect\nyou from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his work. it then turns out\nthat he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and continued to make a really\ndangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes , was also my doing , though email after email said , I take no\nresponsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your response was that was my opinion\nwas only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan you told me he was gone. however he\ntoo is still there, and a waste of money and space.\n\nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the foreign\nfunds repatriation plan that 1 had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions to make re\nmy time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit much time and\nmake any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced mess.\n\nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following.\n\nYou have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully\nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would\nbe much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??!. Iam\nconcermed re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn\nACCURATE .. org charts. books , balance sheets . trust valuations. are alla part. Barry will need 2 months\nto just get his arm around what is there , this is before any needed modifications.,\n\na way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts , filing\nrequirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into\nnew plan. . \"XXXXX\" planning. art partnership engagement .. , airplane re-do. , buying another. .? boat\nsale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years overdue. . an accounting system. fire john\n.. Joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and . except for heather everyone should be replaced with\nnew. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize. cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023330",
