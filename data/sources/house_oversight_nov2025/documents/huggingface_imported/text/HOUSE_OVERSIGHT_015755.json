  "text": "The Imitation Game\n\ns an experiment, I am going to ask a student to spend a week in\nA: locked room. The room is perfectly nice; it has a bed, a light, a\n\ndesk, some reading matter, oh, and we'll give him some washing\nfacilities too! Every now and then I post some food under the door to\nkeep him going, Pop-tarts and pizza (thin-crust) work well.\n\nOn the first evening a note is pushed under his door with a symbol\non it. The student puzzles for a while, then opens the book sitting on\nthe desk. The book says, “If you get a piece of paper with symbols on it\nlook them up and follow the instructions.” He looks up the symbols and\nthe entry in the book says, “Go to page 44, write down the third symbol\non a piece of paper then post it back under the door.” He follows the\ninstruction and is rewarded with another piece of paper, this time with a\nlarger set of symbols on it. Again he follows the instructions in the book\nand posts his answer back under the door. This goes on for several days.\nHe is somewhat bemused, but it passes the time, and he diligently looks\nup the symbols and performs all the complicated actions as instructed.\n\nMeanwhile, I meet our new Chinese graduate student and explain\nto her she needs to interview a potential translator for the department.\nHe has just come in from Hong Kong and there is a health scare, so we\nhave quarantined him in the lab room. He is bored and I have some\npaper for writing messages. She writes “hello” in Chinese on a piece of\npaper and posts it under the door.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015755",
