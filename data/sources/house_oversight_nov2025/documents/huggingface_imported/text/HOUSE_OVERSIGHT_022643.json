If\nanyone has any questions concerning this, the following site gives the information. They were criminals, and I\nstill do not understand how slick Willy was not considered so at the time of his nomination.\n\nhttp://prorev.com/legacy.htm\n\n54.\n\nDoug James\nMarch 27, 2014 at 10:03 pm — Log in to Reply\n\nBill Clinton has had a sexual problem for his entire life. People like the Clintons, Obamas, Bidens, Reids,\nSchumers, Boehners, Bushs, etc. can willingly, knowingly, & intentionally commit crimes with no recourse.\nThe U.S. Supreme Court rules Obamacare is a tax, Most likely will make Hobby Lobby & similar companies do\nwhat they are morally against, Will likely ultimately rule to enact strict gun control laws if not an outright ban,\nAllow open boarders, & Immigrants. They always rule in the gov’ts favor. Rarely for the citizenship any longer.\nIf the Constitution is ever amended and/or rewrote which they are in favor of they need to be given term &\npower limits. They are the Supreme Power of this Nation and have proven to be a bunch of decrepit buffoons.\n\n_————\n\n33.\n\nMagic1808\nMarch 27, 2014 at 10:39 pm — Log in to Reply\n\nBOBMANIO1, I sure hope so, this subject is outrageous, and I don’t know where the minds of these people are.\nA pedophile ring is beyond my scope of understanding, and about one of the worst things that could ever be\nconsidered acceptable. It is an extremely important issue, and I sure don’t want it to escape full coverage by the\nmedia.\n\nSSS a Sr wee\n\n56.\nMario\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022643",
