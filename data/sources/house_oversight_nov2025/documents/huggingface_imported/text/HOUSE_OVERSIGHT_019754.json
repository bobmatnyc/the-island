  "text": "266 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nAlexander Litvinenko, I had interviewed Andrei Lugovoy. A former\nKGB officer assigned to protecting the Kremlin’s top members in the\n1990s, Lugovoy later opened his own security company. In 2005, he\nbecame a business associate of Litvinenko’s in gathering informa-\ntion and made regular trips to London to meet with him. Because\nhe had tea with Litvinenko at the Pine Bar of the Millennium Hotel\nin London on November 1, 2006, the day Litvinenko was poisoned,\nhe became the main suspect in the British investigation. He could\nnot be extradited, however. After reconstructing the chronology of\nthe crime, I established that Litvinenko had been contaminated with\npolonium at a Japanese restaurant some four hours before his tea\nwith Lugovoy. I therefore wrote that the crime scene might not have\nbeen at the Pine Bar, a finding that he said he greatly appreciated.\n\nLugovoy was elected to the Duma in 2007 and also hosted a\ntwenty-four-part television series on espionage for which Putin per-\nsonally decorated him. He was also now reputed to be in the inner\ncircle of power in Moscow. So I called him.\n\nWe arranged to meet in the bar of the Hotel National. A short\n\n© but well-built man with a bullet-style haircut, Lugovoy showed ©\nup promptly at 1:00 p.m. After discussing some of the subsequent\ndevelopments in the still-lingering polonium investigation, I asked\nhim if he knew Kucherena.\n\n“T don’t know him, but I know someone who does,” he answered.\n“Why are you interested in seeing Kucherena?”\n\nI told him that I wanted to speak to him about Snowden but I had\nbeen unable to arrange a meeting.\n\n“That’s no problem,” he said, raising his cell phone (which never\nleft his hand). He hit a number on the speed dial and spoke rapidly\nin Russian (which I do not understand). He cupped his hand over the\nphone and asked how long I would be in Moscow. After I told him\nthat I was leaving that Friday, he spoke again in Russian to the per-\nson on the other end. “You will have an appointment on Thursday,”\nhe said.\n\nLater that afternoon, Valentina, Kucherena’s assistant, called to\nsay that Kucherena would be happy to see me at his office at 6:00 p.m.\non Thursday. I didn’t ask Lugovoy whom he had called. Whomever\nLugovoy called obviously had the power to arrange the meeting.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 266 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019754",
