Had that option been\nchosen, we would not object to your notifying the alleged victims at this point. At this juncture,\nhowever, we do not accept your contention that there is a requirement that the government notify\nthe alleged victims of a potential civil remedy in this case.\n\nAccordingly, for all the reasons we have stated above, we respectfully -- and firmly --\nobject to your sending any letter whatsoever to the alleged victims in this matter. Furthermore, if\na letter is to be sent to these individuals, we believe we should have a right to review and make\nobjections to that submission prior to it being sent to any alleged victims. We also request that if\nyour Office believes that it must send a letter to go to the alleged victims, who still have not been\nidentified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein has entered his plea. This letter should\nthen come from the attorney representative, and not from the Government, to avoid any bias.\n\nAs you know, Judge Starr has requested a meeting with Assistant Attorney General Fisher\nto address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component of the\nAgreement. We are hopeful that this meeting will take place as early as next week. Accordingly,\nwe respectfully request that we postpone our discussion of sending a letter to the alleged victims\nuntil after that meeting. We strongly believe that rushing to send any letter out this week is not\nthe wisest manner in which to proceed. Given that Mr. Epstein will not even enter his plea for\nanother few weeks, time is clearly not of the essence regarding any notification to the identified\nindividuals.\n\nThanks very much,\n\nJay\n\n“Sloman, Jeff (USAFLS)\"\nTo “Jay Lefkowitz\" .\n11/27/2007 01:55 PM ce \"Acosta, Alex (USAFLS)\" Po\n\nSubject Epstein\n\nJay,\n\nPlease accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather\nyesterday. I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving.\n\nRegarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis’ selection, I’d like to make a few\nobservations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making\nreasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact,\n\nwhen I told you of Judge Davis’s selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 21°,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012677",
