I thinks it makes sense, though, for us to have a more \nspecific conversation about compensation before I meet with him. I don't want to put the cart before the horse, \nbut as I mentioned, this would be a big move for me, and it would have to make sense economically in addition \nto being the right move for other reasons we have discussed. \nI hope you are well. Cannot believe that Christie endorsed Trump! \nBest, \nKathy \nSent from my iPad \nOn Feb 25, 2016, at 5:23 AM, Immelt, Stephen J. < > wrote: \nKathy \nI don't want to pester you, but in the hope that you are still intrigued, I wanted to suggest that we try to set up an \nopportunity for you to meet Michael Davison, our global head of litigation.
