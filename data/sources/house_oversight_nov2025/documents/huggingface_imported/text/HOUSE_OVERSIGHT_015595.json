  "text": "(Fla. 2d DCA 1977) (“The judge’s statement that he had ‘cogent reasons’ for sealing the records\nobviously fell short of specifically setting forth the reasons why public access to these deposition\nwas being denied.”). Moreover, Roberts and Plaintiffs cannot argue that sealing her deposition\nin its entirety is “the least restrictive” option, as it is most certainly the most restrictive option\nand one that Florida courts take very seriously. “[A] closure order must be drawn with\nparticularity and narrowly applied.” Barron, 531 So. 2d at 117.\n\nHere, that requisite “least restrictive” application requires, at a minimum, allowing\nDershowitz to use Roberts’s testimony for the limited purposes necessary in the professional\njudgment of his counsel to represent their client, as a matter of fairness and due process.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nBecause Dershowitz must be able to prepare his defense and any sealing order must be\nthe least restrictive measure available, the Court should modify the Confidentiality Order to\nconfirm that Dershowitz’s counsel may disclose Roberts’s testimony as they deem necessary in\n\ntheir professional judgment in order to represent Dershowitz in this case.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015595",
