  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nI set to work on the capital punishment project but found no suggestion in the case law that any\ncourt had ever considered the death penalty to be of questionable constitutionality. Just five years\nearlier, Chief Justice Earl Warren had written in Trop v. Dulles (1958) that “whatever the\narguments may be against capital punishment, both on moral grounds and in terms of\naccomplishing the purposes of punishment—and they are forceful—the death penalty has been\nemployed throughout our history, and, in a day when it is still widely accepted it cannot be said to\nviolate the constitutional concept of cruelty.”\n\nI duly reported this to Justice Goldberg, suggesting that if even the liberal chief justice believed\nthat the death penalty was constitutional, what chance did he have of getting a serious hearing for\nhis view that the cruel and unusual punishment clause should now be construed to prohibit the\nimposition of capital punishment? Justice Goldberg asked me to talk to Justice Brennan and see\nwhat his views were. Unless Justice Brennan agreed to join, the entire project would be scuttled,\nsince Justice Goldberg, the Court’s rookie, did not want to “be out there alone,” against the chief\njustice and the rest of the Court.\n\nI had previously met Justice Brennan several times over the preceding few years, since his son,\nBill, was my classmate and moot-court partner at Yale Law School. I had also had lunch several\ntimes with the justice and his friend Judge David Bazelon. But none of our discussions had been\nsubstantive, and I nervously anticipated the task of discussing an important issue with one of my\njudicial heroes.\n\nI brought a rough draft of the memorandum I was working on to the meeting, but Justice Brennan\ndid not want to look at it then. He asked me to describe the results of my research to him,\npromising to read the memorandum later. I stated the nascent constitutional case against the\ndeath penalty as best I could. I told him that Weems v. United States could be read as recognizing\nthe following tests for whether punishment was “cruel and unusual”: (I) giving full weight to\nreasonable legislative findings, a punishment is cruel and unusual if a less severe one can as\neffectively achieve the permissible ends of punishment (that is, deterrence, isolation, rehabilitation,\nor whatever the contemporary society considers the permissible objectives of punishment);\n\n(2) regardless of its effectiveness in achieving the permissible ends of punishment, a punishment is\ncruel and unusual if it offends the contemporary sense of decency (for example, torture); (3)\nregardless of its effectiveness in achieving the permissible ends of punishment, a punishment is\ncruel and unusual if the evil it produces is disproportionally\n\nhigher than the harm it seeks to prevent (for example, the death penalty for economic crimes).\n\nIn addition to these abstract formulations, I also told Justice Brennan that my research had\ndisclosed a widespread pattern of unequal application of the death penalty on racial grounds. I\ncited national prison statistics showing that between 1937 and 1951, 233 Blacks were executed\nfor rape in the United States, while only 26 whites were executed for that crime, though Whites\ncommitted many more rapes than Blacks.\n\nJustice Brennan encouraged me to continue my research, without making any promise that he\nwould join any action by Justice Goldberg. Several weeks later, Justice Goldberg told me that\n\n160\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017247",
