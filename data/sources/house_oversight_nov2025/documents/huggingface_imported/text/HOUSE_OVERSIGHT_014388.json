  "text": "The PNC Financial Services Group, Inc. (PNC)\n\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive at our $110 PO\nand assign a 1.4x multiple to 2017E TBV and 14x multiple on 2017E EPS, in line with\ntarget multiples for the median large regional banks under coverage. We have weighted\nthe P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%.\n\nA superior profitability profile suggests an above peer multiple - however, a challenging\nmacro backdrop and specific industry headwinds restrain our P/E target. Our DCF\nassumes a two-stage cost of capital of 9.6% and 11.2% and a terminal growth rate of\n4%,\n\nRisks are macro risks such as a lower for longer rate environment, the implementation\nof a strict liquidity coverage ratio and further regulation on overdraft income that\nrestricts bank profitability.\n\nU.S. Bancorp (USB)\n\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF} to arrive at our $50 PO,\nassigning an above peer 2.8x multiple to 2017E TBV and near median 14.5x multiple on\n2017E EPS due to their above median profitability. We have weighted the P/E and\nP/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%. Our DCF assumes a two-\nstage cost of capital of 9.5% and 10.9% and a terminal growth rate of 5%.\n\nRisks to our price objective are macro risks such as a double dip recession, the\nimplementation of a strict liquidity coverage ratio and further regulation on overdraft\nincome that restricts bank profitability. Specific to USB, risks are enhanced regulatory\nscrutiny and capital standards as a Domestic SIFIl and an announcement of a large\nexpensive deal that could weigh on the stock price.\n\nUMB Financial Corporation (UMBF)\n\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $78 price\nobjective and assign a 1.8x multiple to our 2Q17E TBY, in-line with peers, and we place\na 18x multiple on our 2017E EPS, above peers given our above median EPS growth\nforecast. Our DCF model assumes cost of equity of 8% and a terminal growth rate of\n4%,\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are continued rising long rates, which could\nnegatively impact the company's sizable securities book and erode tangible book value.\nIn addition, a sudden outflow of deposits could impact EPS and the asset sensitivity of\nUMBF's balance sheet to higher interest rates. Upside risks to our price objective are a\nmuch faster asset mix change into higher yielding loans that significantly increases its\nnet interest margin.\n\nWells Fargo & Company (WFC)\n\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF} to arrive at our $55 PO,\nassigning a 1.75x multiple to 2017E TBV and 13x multiple on 2017E EPS. We have\nweighted the P/E and P/TBV factors equally at 40%, and our DCF analysis by 20%.\n\nOur 1.6x TBV multiple represents a 0.3x premium to our mega-cap median multiple, but\nwe believe this is justified due to WFC's superior returns on tangible equity (ROTE\nconsistent between 13%-14% throughout our forecast period, versus 12% for peers).\nOur 12x EPS multiple is in line with our mega-cap median multiple. We believe WFC\ndeserves to trade at a premium due to better earnings growth, but we are assuming\nWFC trades in line with peers due to a higher percentage of earnings from mortgage\nbanking and accretable yield, as well as potentially greater regulatory scrutiny as the\nsecond largest US depository. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 11% and\na terminal growth rate of 4%.\n\n74 2016 Future of Financials Conference | 17 November 2016 Bankof America 2\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014388",
