  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\nChapter 1\n\nValidating Autocracy through the Ballot\n\nA major difference between modern authoritarian\nsystems and traditional dictatorships lies in the role of\nelections for parliament and head of state.\n\nTwentieth-century dictatorships often dispensed with\nelections entirely or conducted them under blatantly\nfraudulent conditions. In the Soviet bloc, elections\nwere a pointless ritual in which citizens were pres-\nsured to go to a polling place and cast ballots for the\nCommunist Party candidate, the only one permitted to\ncompete. Military and postcolonial dictatorships often\ncanceled elections on spurious “national emergency\"\ngrounds, or rigged the outcome through crude bal-\nlot-stuffing and open intimidation.\n\nAt acertain point in the 1980s, however, the strong-\nmen, juntas, and revolutionary councils of the era\nrealized that reasonably fair elections could no longer\nbe avoided. Sometimes a ruling group understood\nthat this would likely lead to an opposition victory. But\nusually, the incumbent leaders—and often foreign\njournalists and diplomats—presumed that voters in\nrepressive settings preferred stability to uncertainty\nand would opt for the reassuring faces of authority.\n\nThese calculations proved wildly misplaced. Opposi-\ntion parties swept to victory in country after coun-\ntry—in Uruguay, Argentina, Nicaragua, South Korea,\nthe Philippines, Poland. The word “stunning” made\n\na frequent appearance in news accounts, as in the\nstunning rejection of the ruling party in Poland, or the\nstunning setback suffered by Chile's Augusto Pinochet\nin a referendum on the continuation of his dicta-\ntorship. Or, perhaps most astonishing, the stunning\ndefeat of Communist Party stalwarts in a number of\nSoviet cities in 1990 local elections.*\n\nElections became a key force behind the wave of de-\nmocratization that engulfed much of the world during\nthat decade. Today, the obligation to hold some form of\nmultiparty balloting is felt by nearly all governments.\n\nThe illusion of pluralism\n\nYet just as with other democratic institutions, modern\nauthoritarians have mastered the techniques of con-\ntrol over the electoral process, maintaining political\ndominance behind a screen of false diversity.\n\nThey have adapted in many ways to the age of the inter-\n\n“We're not perfect. But we do have\ndemocracy.”\n\n—Hugo Chavez\n\n“Yes, we falsified the last election...\n\nIn fact, 93.5 percent [of ballots were]\nfor President Lukashenka. People\nsay this is not a European result, so\nwe changed it to 86 percent.”\n\n—Alyaksandr Lukashenka\n\nnet and the expectations of a better-informed public. In\nthe most sophisticated authoritarian states, profes-\nsional political operatives—in Russia they are called\n“oolitical technologists’—work just as hard as their\ncounterparts in the United States. Their goal, however,\nis not to defeat opposition candidates in a competitive\nsetting, but rather to organize a system that creates the\nillusion of competition while squelching it in reality.\n\nIn most countries, elections are largely “free and fair,\"\nmeaning the playing field is reasonably level, there is an\nhonest tabulation of the ballots, vote buying and ballot\nstuffing do not change the outcome, and independent\nelection observers are allowed to monitor the proceed-\nings. For 2015, Freedom in the World placed the num-\nber of electoral democracies at 125, around 64 percent\nof the world’s sovereign states.? By historical standards,\nthis is an impressive figure. Still, there are 70 countries\nthat do not qualify as electoral democracies. In all but\na few of these settings, elections are indeed held, but\nthey are either badly flawed or patently dishonest.\n\nYet even in systems where elections are tainted or fixed\noutright, authoritarian leaders often claim legitimacy\nfrom the ballot box. Of the countries assessed in this\nstudy, only China rejects elections as part of the leader-\nships strategy for political control. In Russia, Turkey, Ven-\nezuela, and elsewhere, the leadership invokes victory at\nthe polls as a mandate for government, including the\nadoption of policies that are in fact deeply unpopular.\n\nIn some authoritarian states, elections are neither free\nnor fair, with heavy manipulation that directly ensures\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019244",
