Here, for the\nfirst time, Snowden communicated directly with first Gellman and then Greenwald.\n\nHe emailed Gellman under the alias “Verax\n\n.’ Already, via Poitras, he had provided this Washington Post journalist with power point slides\nfrom a NSA presentation about a joint FBI-NSA-CIA operation codenamed PRISM. He believed\nit qualified as whistle-blowing because it revealed that the NSA, in intercepting emails, tweets,\npostings and other Web interactions about foreign terrorists, incidentally also picked up data\nabout Americans. According to the rules imposed on the NSA by a 2007 presidential directive,\nwhatever information accidently picked up about Americans was supposed to be filtered out, and\nhundreds of compliance officers rechecked the data ever 90 says to assure that directive was\nbeing carried. Even so, it was likely some data was not expunged in this process. So PRISM\ncould cause embarrassment for the NSA.\n\nSnowden proposed that Gellman join him in Hong Kong. In attempting to persuade him of the\nurgency of the trip, he wrote him that he had reason to believe that “omniscient State powers”\nimperiled “our freedom and way of life.” He noted, with a touch of modesty, “Perhaps I am\nnaive.” He added dramatically “I have risked my life and family.” Even so, Gellman declined\ncoming to Hong Kong. (According to Greenwald, Gellman could not make the trip because\nlawyers for the Washington Post were uneasy with having a reporter receive classified documents\nin a part of China.)\n\nNext, on May 24, 2013, Snowden attempted to apply more pressure on Gellman by telling him\nthat the story about the PRISM program had to be published by the Post within 72 hours.\nGellman could not accede to such a condition because the decision of when to publish a story was\nmade not by him but by the editors of the newspaper. He told Snowden that the earliest the story\ncould be published was June 6, 2013, which was well past Snowden’s deadline.\n\nSnowden next turned to Greenwald. Both Poitras and Micah Lee had made great efforts to\ntutor Greenwald on encryption protocols, with Lee, who was in Berkeley, California, sending\nGreenwald by Fedex a DVD that would allow him to receive both encrypted messages and phone\ncalls. Even then, Greenwald was unable to fully install it. As a result, Greenwald still had not met\nSnowden’s requisites on encrypting his computer.\n\nIn addition, possibly because of a lost message, Snowden believed that Greenwald was\nreluctant to fly to the place that he designated for a meeting. With Gellman uncertain, Greenwald\nwas now essential to his plan. If he was to have any newspaper outlet, he needed to persuade\nGreenwald to come to Hong Kong. At this point, he took matters in to his own hands. On\nMay 25, 2013, Snowden somewhat aggressively emailed Greenwald “You recently had to decline\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020245",
