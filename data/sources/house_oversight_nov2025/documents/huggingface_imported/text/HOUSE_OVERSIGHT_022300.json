  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54029\n\nemployees about their rights.176 But\nseveral comments complain that the\nrule does not define “significant.” 127\nBaker & McKenzie proposes that the\nstandard be 40 percent specifically of\nthe employer’s production and\nmaintenance workforce, while the\nNational Immigration Law Center\nproposes a 5 percent standard. Another\ncomment urges that translated notices\nbe required whenever any of the\nemployees are not proficient in\nEnglish.128 The U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce asserts that a safe harbor is\nneeded for employers when a notice in\na particular language is not yet available\nfrom the Board. Moreover, a few\ncomments contend that the Board\nshould also provide Braille notices for\nvision-impaired employees, as well as\naudio versions for illiterate employees,\nand versions of the notice that are\nadaptable to assistive technologies.129\nOne individual proposes that the rule\nmandate that employers read the notice\nto employees when they are hired and\nto all employees annually.\n\nHaving carefully considered the\ncomments, the Board has decided to\ndefine “significant” in terms of foreign-\nlanguage speakers as 20 percent or more\nof an employer’s workforce. Thus, if as\nmany as 20 percent of an employer’s\nemployees are not proficient in English\nbut speak the same foreign language, the\nemployer must post the notice in that\nlanguage, both physically and\nelectronically (if the employer is\notherwise required to post the notice\nelectronically). If an employer’s\nworkforce includes two or more groups\nconstituting at least 20 percent of the\nworkforce who speak different\nlanguages, the employer must either\nphysically post the notice in each of\nthose languages or, at the employer’s\noption, post the notice in the language\nspoken by the largest group of\nemployees and provide each employee\nin each of the other language groups a\ncopy of the notice in the appropriate\nlanguage. If such an employer is also\nrequired to post the notice\nelectronically, it must do so in each of\nthose languages. If some of an\nemployer’s employees speak a language\nnot spoken by employees constituting at\nleast 20 percent of the employer’s\nworkforce, the employer is encouraged,\nbut not required, either to provide the\n\n126 See, e.g., comments of National Immigration\nLaw Center, Legal Aid Society—Employment Law\nCenter, and La Raza Centro Legal; Filipino\nAdvocates for Justice.\n\n127 See, e.g., comments of COLLE; Food Marketing\nInstitute (FMI).\n\n128 Georgetown law students.\n\n129 See, e.g., Baker & McKenzie; Heritage\nFoundation; Georgetown law students.\n\nnotice to those employees in their\nrespective language or languages or to\ndirect them to the Board’s Web site,\nhttp://www.nirb.gov, where they can\nobtain copies of the notice in their\nrespective languages. The Board has\nalso decided to add to the notice\ninstructions for obtaining foreign-\nlanguage translations of the notice.\n\nEmployers will be required to request\nforeign-language notices from the Board\nor obtain them from the Board’s Web\nsite in the same manner as the English-\nlanguage notice. If an employer requests\nfrom the Board a notice in a particular\nlanguage in which the notice is not\navailable, the requesting employer will\nnot be liable for non-compliance with\nthe rule until the notice becomes\navailable in that language.\n\nWith respect to employees who are\nvision-impaired or those who are\nilliterate, employers may consult the\nBoard’s Regional Office on a case-by-\ncase basis for guidance on appropriate\nmethods of providing the required\nnotice, including by audio recording.\n\nd. Electronic Posting\n\nMany employer comments oppose the\nrequirement for electronic notice. The\nCoalition for a Democratic Workplace\npoints out that other agencies do not\nrequire both electronic and physical\nposting and asserts that only one\nmethod is necessary. For example, the\nCoalition notes that the Family and\nMedical Leave Act notice obligation is\nsatisfied by electronic posting alone,\nand other statutes do not mention\nelectronic posting. The National Council\nof Agricultural Employers urges the\nBoard to require electronic posting only\nif the employer posts other statutory or\nregulatory notices in that fashion.\nAnother proposes that employers be\npermitted to choose either physical or\nelectronic posting. The National\nAssociation of Manufacturers remarks\nthat the proposed rule breaks new\nground for using an employer’s email\nsystem to communicate information\nabout “union membership.” The U.S.\nChamber of Commerce suggests that this\naspect of the rule would chill\nemployers’ use of new technologies. On\nthe other hand, the AFL-CIO and\nseveral other commenters t*° support\nelectronic as well as physical posting;\nthe Center for American Progress Action\nFund, among others, points out that\nelectronic communications at work are\nstandard now.\n\nAfter carefully considering these\ncomments, the Board concludes that\nelectronic posting will substantially\n\n130 See, e.g., comments of Gibson, Dunn, Cohen,\nLeifer & Yellig, P.C.; Beeson, Tayer & Bodine.\n\nassist in providing the prescribed notice\nto employees. As some comments state,\nelectronic communication is now a\nroutine practice in many workplaces\nand the source of much information\nfrom employers to their employees.\nHowever, the Board has clarified the\nfinal rule to mandate only that, if an\nemployer customarily communicates\npersonnel rules or policies to its\nemployees in that manner, it must also\ndo so with respect to the notice of\nemployee rights under the NLRA. The\nconcern that the rule will discourage\nemployers from using new technologies\nis apparently not widely shared and, in\nthe Board’s view, is implausible.\nAlthough the Board recognizes that\nsome other statutes and regulations do\nnot require electronic notice, it notes\nthat they generally predated the routine\nuse of electronic communications in the\nworkplace. Having only recently begun\nordering electronic posting of remedial\nnotices,!$? the Board has limited\nexperience in this area, and employers\nare encouraged to contact the local\nRegional Office with questions about\nthis provision. The Board does not agree\nthat employers should be permitted to\nchoose whether to provide physical or\nelectronic notice, because some\nemployers could select the less effective\nof these alternatives, thus undermining\nthe purpose of the rule. Finally, the\nrights stated in the notice are not\naccurately described as pertaining solely\nto union membership, and the notice is\nnot intended to promote union\nmembership or union representation.\nRather, the notice addresses a broad\nrange of employee legal rights under the\nNLRA, which involve protected\nconcerted activity as well as union\nactivity in both organized and\nunorganized workplaces, and also the\nright to refrain from any such activity.\nMany employer comments note that\nthe proposed rule also does not define\n“customarily” as it pertains to\nelectronic posting in § 104.202(f), i.e.,\nthe type and degree of communication\nthat triggers the requirement.13\nNumerous employers also participated\nin a postcard campaign objecting,\namong other things, that employers use\na wide variety of technology to\ncommunicate with employees and that\nthe rule could require them to use all\nmethods to convey the notice.133 For\n\n131 J, Picini Flooring, 356 NLRB No. 9 (2010).\n\n182 See, e.g., comments of International\nFoodservice Distributors Association (IFDA);\nAssociated Builders and Contractors; Los Angeles\nCounty Business Federation; National Roofing\nContractors Association.\n\n133 See, e.g., comments of American Home\nFurnishings Alliance; Seawright Custom Precast;\n\nContinued\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022300",
