This is one of the particular\ngrievances that have powered the protest movement, though certainly\nthe ripples of the successful Egyptian and Tunisian uprisings played a\nhand. The government, to put it bluntly, responded poorly. Troops in\nDaraa fired live rounds against youthful demonstrators and virtually\nall communications -- Internet and telephone -- were shuttered to\nprevent the seepage of unrest.\n\nTo make matters worse, Damascus blamed Israeli provocateurs, rebel\nforces, and shady foreign agents for the bloodshed -- anyone but its\nown forces. Civilian deaths at the hands of security forces there, and\nmore recently in the coastal city of Latakia, have outraged opinion\nacross the country, setting alight long pent-up anger at the denial of\nbasic freedoms, the monopolistic rule of the Baath party, and the\nabuses of a privileged elite.
