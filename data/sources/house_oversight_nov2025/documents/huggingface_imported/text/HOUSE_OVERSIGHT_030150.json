Noticed this Guardian story about Michael Wolff's new book, which states Donald Trump\npurchased a Palm Beach property Mr. Epstein had planned to buy, behind Mr. Epstein's back. And that Mr.\nEpstein threatened to expose Trump's shady real estate deals. Do you know anything about this? Does Mr.\nEpstein have any knowledge of illegal or suspicious dealings by President Trump?\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/28/bannon-trump-organization-criminal-enterprise-\n\ncomments-michael-wolff-book\n\nAlso, we plan on running a story this Friday about the Crime Victims' Rights Act suit, and the Jane Does'\nproposed remedies. The alleged victims want the U.S. Attorney's Office to rescind the immunity provisions in\nthe NPA, and to pursue a prosecution against Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators. Can you comment on this?\n\nThanks so much!\n\nKate\n\nKate Briquelet\n\nSenior Reporter\n\ns\n\nJoin Beast Inside, our new membership program, to get more of the journalism you trust and love.\n\nVirus-free. www.avast.com\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
