The rules applicable to PFICs are complex, and the foregoing summary of U.S. federal\nincome taxation of U.S. Partners indirectly owning an interest in a PFIC is general in nature. It\nis possible that U.S. Partners may be subject to tax currently under the PFIC regime on their\nproportionate shares of certain earnings of a non-U.S. corporation in which the Fund holds an\ninterest and/or may incur nondeductible interest-like charges on tax liability deferred under the\nPFIC regime without receiving from the Fund distributions sufficient to satisfy any such\nobligations.\n\nIn addition to the PFIC rules discussed above, a U.S. person that is a shareholder of a PFIC may\nbe required to file an annual information report and/or applicable tax forms with the IRS.\n\nControlled Foreign Corporations - Under Sections 951 through 957 of the Code, special rules\napply to U.S. persons who own, directly or indirectly and applying certain attribution rules,\n10% or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of a non-U.S. corporation\n(each, a “United States Shareholder”) that is a “controlled foreign corporation” (“CFC”). For\nthis purpose, the Fund will be treated as a United States Shareholder of any foreign corporation\nin which the Fund’s share ownership reaches this 10% threshold. A non-U.S. corporation\ngenerally will be a CFC for a taxable year if United States Shareholders collectively own more\nthan 50% of the total combined voting power or total value of the corporation’s stock on any\nday during such taxable year. United States Shareholders of a CFC generally must include in\ntheir gross income for U.S. federal income tax purposes their pro rata shares of certain earnings\nand profits of the CFC. Further, under Section 1248 of the Code, if a U.S. person sells or\nexchanges stock of a non-U.S. corporation and that person is or was a United States Shareholder\nat any time during the five-year period ending on the date of such sale or exchange during\nwhich that non-U.S. corporation was a CFC, that U.S. person generally will be required to treat\na portion of the gain recognized upon such sale or exchange as a dividend to the extent of the\nearnings and profits of the CFC attributable to such stock. Under U.S. federal income tax rules,\nthe Fund itself is a U.S. person and, if the Fund becomes a United States Shareholder of a CFC,\ntaxable U.S. Partners (i) will be required to report and pay tax currently on their shares of the\nCFC’s earnings and profits attributable to the Fund that are taxable to its United States\nShareholders under the CFC rules, and (ii) will be subject to the Section 1248 recharacterization\nrule described above. In addition, if the Fund is a United States Shareholder of a CFC and a\nU.S. Partner disposes of its Limited Partner Interest, that Partner generally will recognize\nincome under Section 751 of the Code equal to its distributive share of the Section 1248 income\nthat would have been triggered if the Fund had sold its interest in the CFC at fair market value.\nThe maximum rate of tax imposed on certain dividend income and certain long-term capital\ngains attributable to dispositions of securities generally is 20%, so that a recharacterization of\ngain under Section 1248 might not increase that U.S. Partner’s U.S. federal income tax liability.\nIn addition, income of a CFC subject to income tax in a country other than the U.S. at an\n\n77 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024088",
