That’s not the case in Syria, where\nthe uprising is backed by an overwhelming majority against a\ngovernment that’s dominated by a small minority — the Ba’ath Party.\nTo make matters worse, the Ba’ath is dominated by the Nusairi\n(Alawite) religious minority, a mere 5 percent of the population.\nThus, Syria’s is a nationwide revolution against a minority regime.\nAlmost all Syrians agree that the situation is untenable. Assad’s\npolicy of rule by massacre has few supporters outside his clan.\nJudging by the revolution’s most popular slogan — “Assad Get Out!”—\na majority may support demands for Assad to stand down, as\nsuggested by Jordan’s King Abdullah.\n\nNevertheless, the Assad clan still controls enough military and\nfinancial assets to continue its rule-by-massacre strategy.\n\nThe result could be the disintegration of the Syrian army and the\nemergence of armed groups beyond the control of either the\ngovernment or the Syrian National Council, the opposition’s\numbrella organization. That could lead to violence spilling into\nneighboring countries, especially Iraq and Lebanon.\n\nRather than speculating about a civil war, the Arab League and the\ninternational community should focus on the dangers that the Syrian\nsituation poses for regional peace.\n\nA Franco-British resolution on Syria won a majority at the UN\nSecurity Council last month but was killed by Russian and Chinese\nvetoes. The Security Council should take up the issue again — this\ntime to debate the threat to the region.\n\nLast month, Russia and China tried to justify their vetoes by claiming\nthat the Arab states were divided over Syria. This wasn’t true then\nand is less so now. The Arab League has suspended Syria’s\nmembership and condemned the rule-by-massacre policy. Arab\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031950",
