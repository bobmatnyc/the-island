  "text": "Brainstorming Mini-Retirement Locations\n\n= Virtual Tourist ( www.virtualtourist.com )\n\nThe single largest source of unbiased, user-generated travel content in the world. More than 1,000,000\nmembers contribute tips and warnings for more than 25,000 locations. Each location is covered in 13\nseparate categories, including Things to Do, Local Customs, Shopping, and Tourist Traps. This is one-\nstop shopping for most mini-retirements.\n\n» Escape Artist ( www.escapeartist.com )\n\nInterested in second passports, starting your own country, Swiss banking, and all the other things I\nwouldn’t dare put in this book? This site is a fantastic resource. Drop me a note from the Caymans or\njail, whichever comes first. Also search “How to Be Jason Bourne” at www.fourhourblog.com.\n\n> Outside Magazine Online Free Archives ( http://outside.away.com )\nThe entire archive of Outside magazine available online for free. From meditation camps to worldwide\n\nadrenaline hotspots, dream jobs to Patagonia winter highlights, there are hundreds of articles with\nbeautiful photos to give you the walkabout itch.\n\n» GridSkipper: The Urban Travel Guide ( www.gridskipper.com )\n\nFor those who love Blade Runner-like settings and exploring the cool nooks and crannies of cities\nworldwide, this is the site. Itis one of Forbes’s Top 13 Travel sites and is “high-falootin’ and low-brow\nall in the same breath” (Frommer’s). Translation: Much of the content is not G-rated. If four-letter words\nor a “world’s sluttiest city” poll bother you, don’t bother visiting this site (or Rio de Janeiro, for that\nmatter). Otherwise, check out the hysterical writing and “$100 a day” info for cities worldwide.\n\n=» Lonely Planet: The Thorn Tree ( http://thorntree.lonelyplanet.com )\n\nDiscussion forum for global travelers with threads separated by region.\n\n» Family Travel Forum ( www.familytravelforum.com )\n\nA comprehensive forum on, you guessed it, family travel. Want to sell your kids for top dollar in the\nEastern Bloc? Or save a few dollars and cremate Grannie in Thailand? Then this isn’t the site. But if you\nhave kids and are planning a big trip, this is the place.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013970",
