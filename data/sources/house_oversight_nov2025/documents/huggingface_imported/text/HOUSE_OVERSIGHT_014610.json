We\nestimate that a net 280 tonnes of gold ETF\nholdings—an amount even larger than the 210\ntonnes of ETF outflows that pressured gold prices\nin late 2016—were purchased over the past year\nat levels above today’s price. Absent a rebound\nin gold prices, these ETF holders might prefer to\nrealize their losses and rotate into instruments with\na yield component. Value-minded investors should\nalso consider that gold prices remains well above\ntheir long-term average (see Exhibit 100).\n\nDespite this challenging outlook, a number\nof factors could still buoy gold prices in the year\nahead. Emerging market central banks have\ncontinued to buy gold to diversify their reserves.\nMoreover, the stronger global growth we expect\ncould lift jewelry demand, particularly in gold’s\ntwo largest end markets—China and India. Finally,\ngold’s allure as an inflation hedge could come back\ninto focus if the market begins to worry about\neconomic overheating in the US, although this is\nnot our base case.\n\nIn light of these crosscurrents, we are tactically\nneutral on gold at this time.\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 77\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014610",
