  "text": "Article 4.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nSyria: Too Big to Fail?\n\nAaron David Miller\n\nMAY 12, 2011 -- If you're a bit confused about U.S. President\nBarack Obama's passivity in the face of Syrian President Bashar al-\nAssad's brutal repression of domestic opposition, don't be. Syria isn't\nLibya. The Assad regime is just too consequential to risk\nundermining.\n\nAlthough the fall of the House of Assad might actually benefit U.S.\ninterests, the president isn't going to encourage it. For realists in the\nWhite House, Assad's demise carries more risks than opportunities.\nGreat powers behave inconsistently -- even hypocritically --\ndepending on their interests. That's not unusual; it's part of the job\ndescription. In fact, in responding to the forces of change and\nrepression loosed throughout the Arab world, flexibility is more\nimportant than ideological rigidity.\n\nThe last thing America needs is a doctrine or ideological template to\ngovern how it responds to fast-breaking changes in a dozen Arab\ncountries, all of which are strikingly different in their respective\ncircumstances.\n\nThat the administration's response often seemed like a giant game of\nwhack-a-mole, with a new problem popping up daily, was inevitable.\nAnd so was the variety of U.S. responses. In Bahrain, where the\nUnited States had established the headquarters of the U.S. Navy's 5th\nFleet, and in Yemen, where counterterrorism is king, interests\ntrumped values. You didn't hear Obama make any \"Qaddafi must go\"-\nstyle speeches directed against Bahrain's ruling Khalifa family or\nYemeni President Ali Abdullah Saleh.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030073",
