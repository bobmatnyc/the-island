Batch activities to limit setup cost and provide more time for dreamline milestones.\n\nWhat can I routinize by batching? That is, what tasks (whether laundry, groceries, mail, payments, or\nsales reporting, for example) can I allot to a specific time each day, week, month, quarter, or year so that\nI don’t squander time repeating them more often than is absolutely necessary ?\n\n3. Set or request autonomous rules and guidelines with occasional review of results.\n\nEliminate the decision bottleneck for all things that are nonfatal if misperformed.
