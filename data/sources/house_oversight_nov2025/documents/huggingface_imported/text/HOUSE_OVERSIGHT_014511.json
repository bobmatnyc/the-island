Muller students\npledge good behavior\n\nUlla F Muller Elementary School\nrolled out its Panther PRIDE Positive\nBehavior Support and Interventions\n(PBIS) initiative at a pep rally at the\nschool on Noy. 30. The fun, high-ener-\ngy event laid the groundwork to teach\nstudents the behaviors that make up a\npositive school environment.\n\nAdministrators taught the students\nthe core values of the school through\nPRIDE: P — positive behaviors, R —\nrespect, I — individual responsibility,\nD — determination and E — excellence.\nStudents held signs depicting the val-\nues while Muller cheerleaders and the\nBoys & Girls Club performed to rally\naround the cause.\n\nSt. Thomas-St. John PBIS district\ncoach Darian Torrice-Hairston, who is\nassigned to Ulla F. Muller Elementary,\npraised the event. “As the PBIS dis-\ntrict coach for Ulla F Muller Elemen-\ntary School, I have certainly caught\nthe Panther PRIDE! It was evident that\nthe administration, staff and students\nexhibited their Positive Behavior, Re-\nspect, Individual Responsibility, Deter-\nmination and Excellence. PBIS and its\nstrategies are a priority at Muller and\nthey are working hard to implement the\nprogram as it fits their school,” she said\n\nFollowing the rally, teachers will\ncontinue to instill the Panther PRIDE\nprinciples in students on a daily ba-\n\nOK UCH\n\nsis as well as demonstrate what Pan-\nther PRIDE looks in each area of the\nschool. School staff will integrate the\nPanther PRIDE language into daily\nroutines to encourage students to strive\nfor excellence.\n\nThe PBIS initiative is rooted in evi-\ndence-based practices meant to increase\nbehavioral and academic outcomes by\nimproving school climate, preventing\nproblematic behavior, increasing learn-\ning time and promoting positive social\nskills. Up to five members from each\nschool were selected to attend training\nfacilitated by PBIS coaches from the\nstate and district. School representatives\nwere tasked with producing positive be-\nhavior values unique to their institutions\nand introduce them to teachers and stu-\ndents. The goal of the PBIS initiative is\nto focus on what the students do right,\nrather than on what they do wrong to\nhelp encourage the repetition of good\nbehavior.\n\nAs Muller Elementary continues\nto support its students through PBIS,\nadditional phases of the initiative will\nbe introduced, such as a positive re-\nward system as well as ceremonies to\ncelebrate student and staff success.\nWith the help of the district coach,\nMuller’s in-house PBIS task force\nwill guide the PBIS initiative to sup-\nport the school.\n\nERS\n\nWholesale & Retail\n\nISLAND LIFE\n\nThe Virgin Islands Daily News 25\n\nid\n\nvue be\n\nCentral High School students that participated in this year’s “Close Up Washington” trip to Washington, D.C., include\n\nEthaliah Henry, Jenna Malcomb, Nathan McGregor, Destiny Stout, Martisha Charles, Pellis Leonard, Franchel Ro-\ndriguez, Jayla Norman, Khaiel James and N’Quelle Golden.
