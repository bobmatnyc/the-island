No matter how we might explain our attack, with the joint exercises soon to\nbegin, it would come over as a deliberate attempt to implicate our most important\nally in a potential conflict with Iran, against the explicit wishes of President\nObama. I felt this even more strongly when, a few weeks later, I was contacted by\none of Bibi’s close political allies. He sounded me out on the possibility of\nlaunching our strike against Iran after the joint exercise: barely two weeks before\nthe 2012 US election. Politically, he argued, Obama would then feel compelled to\nsupport Israel’s action, or at the very least to refrain from criticizing it. In other\nwords, we would be setting a political trap for the President of the United States. I\ncouldn’t quite believe he was suggesting it. But my reply to this last-gasp\nsuggestion of a way for us to attack the Iranian sites required no hesitation, and\nonly two words: “No way.”\n\nBibi would have known I would oppose such a ploy. But as with so much else\nin the years I spent in his government, I think it was the politics of the scheme,\nmore than the substance, that enticed him. Almost everything he did seemed\nincreasingly about creating a kind of grand narrative to secure his position on the\nright, solidifying a base which he figured would sustain him in office. At its core,\nthe narrative presented a picture of vulnerability and victimhood: a kind of\n“fortress Israel” threatened by terror, missiles on its northern and southern borders,\nand now potential nuclear annihilation from Iran, while our main ally, the United\nStates, was under the sway of a President who neither understood nor\nfundamentally supported us. In day-to-day policy terms, this allowed Bibi to insist\nwe couldn’t risk serious engagement with the Palestinians. On domestic issues as\nwell, like the widening gap between those at the top of our high-tech economy and\na painfully squeezed middle class, the sense of crisis he encouraged gave him\nlicense to hunker down, warn of impending doom, and do virtually nothing.\n\nEffective though the narrative was for him politically, it bore no resemblance to\nreality. Yes, President Obama disagreed with us on issues of policy, both the peace\nprocess and on how to deal with Iran. But he was unquestionably committed to\nAmerica’s alliance with Israel. I had dealt face-to-face with four US presidents:\nboth of the Bushes, President Clinton and now President Obama. In terms of Israeli\nsecurity, none had proved as consistently supportive and helpful as Obama. And\nyes, Israel did face an array of security challenges. A nuclear-armed Iran would\nundeniably make things worse. But far from being under existential threat, we\n\n428\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011899",
