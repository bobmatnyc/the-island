Also, there’ s a scenario\nfloating around that Joe Biden will drop out of the race in deference to\nHillary as Obama’ s vice-presidential running mate replacing Biden.

It’ s the honorable thing to\ndo.\n\nPALIN: What are you gonna do, kick me off the island? Let’ s face it,\nJohn, if | dropped out, you’ d lose the election for sure, and you know it.\nYou need to show me off during this campaign. |’ m your biggest asset. |\nwanted to go on my own Palin Talk Express tour, but no, your neocon\nfriends--they discovered me a year before you and | met--and now\nthey’ reso afraid | can’ t function without their guidance. They’ re like a\nmad beehive, spouting campaign buzz words at me. But | will mever drop\nout of this race. | would sooner give to the media my tape of our one-\nnight stand in my hotel room at the governors’ conference last February.\n\nMcCAIN: If you were to do that, | would release my tape of this\nwhole conversation.
