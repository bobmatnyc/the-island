Most (77%) insurance plans only use a co-pay (in\nexample #1), which gives consumers little incentive to shop the most cost-effective treatment\n\npath.\nKP Source: Kaiser/HRET Survey of Employer-Sponsored Health Benefits, 2009\nwww.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 307\n\nRestructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—Possible Solutions\n\n2) Reimbursement Reform\n\nReimbursement reform could help shift drivers of payment from quantity of\ncare to quality of care. The following list provides a few options to consider.\n\n* Bundled Payments: Providers get a fixed budget to treat an episode of care (i.e. a broken\nhip). Exceeding the budget means providers absorb additional costs; staying under it lets\nprovider benefit from savings.\n\nExamples: PROMETHEUS Payment System’, Medicare Acute Care Episode\nDemonstration?\n\n* Global payment system® (i.e., capitation): Providers are paid up-front to provide care that their\n\npatient receives over a period, incentivizing them to manage costs and quality. This global\npayment is adjusted periodically to reward accessible and high-quality care.\n\n* Pay for performance*: Reimbursement for care providers varies, based on various quality and\nefficiency measures such as discharge rate and readmission rate.\n\n* Accountable Care Organizations (ACOs): Provider groups accept responsibility for the cost\nand quality of care for a specific population of patients®\n\nThe recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act includes regulations\nsupporting the creation of Accountable Care Organizations\n\nOther models often discussed to improve coordination / efficiency and reduce costs : 1)\nintegrated delivery systems; 2) multispecialty group practices; 3) physician-hospital\norganizations; 4) independent practice associations; 5) virtual physician organizations\nSource: 1) Cutting Healthcare Costs by Putting Doctors on a Budget, Time 1) Adopted in Rockford, iL in Jan 2010 2) Medicare Demonstration Project Overviews,\nwww.cms.gov/demoprojects 3) Recommendations of the Special Commission on the Healthcare Payment, Commonwealth of Massachusetts 4) Pay for\nPerformance incentive Programs in Healthcare , Geoffrey Baker 5) How the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Innovation Should Test Accountable Care\n\nKP Organizations, Stephen Shortell, Lawrence P.
