Marra, initially involved two women, identified as Jane Doe#1 and Jane Doe#2, who\n\nsaid they were sexually abused by Epstein and trafficked as minors.\n\nOn Dec. 30, 2014, Edwards asked to have two newaccusers added to the case — identified as Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe#4.\n\nJane Doe#3 alleges inthe court filing that Maxwell and Epstein kept her as a “sex slave” from 1999 through 20002, when she escaped to an unspecified foreign country.\nEpstein forced Jane Doe#3, who was thena minor, to have sex with politically connected and wealthy people, the court filing alleges.\n\n“Epstein’s purpose in ‘lending’ Jane Doe [along with otheryoung girls] to such powerful people [was] to ingratiate himself with them for business, personal, political and financial\n\ngain, as well as to obtain blackmail information,” the filing alleges.\n\nJane Doe#3 identifies one of the men she was forced to have sex with as Dershowitz, a former Harvard law professorandhigh- profile criminaldefense lawyer.\n“Dershowitz was an eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s co-conspirators,” the filing alleges.\n\nDershowitz denied the claims, describing them as part ofan extortion plot. He called the filing “the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen.”\n\n“They manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested in money,” Dershowitz said.\n\nDershowitz said he intends to file complaints against Edwards and Cassell. “This is a disbarrable offense, and they willbe disbarred,” Dershowitz said. “They willrue the day they ever\n\nmade this false charge againstme.”\n\nKnowingly making defamatory statements in courtrecords can be grounds for disbarment.
