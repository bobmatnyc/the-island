Paris for the day by\nEurostar is so easy. Everyone was smiling, happy and friendly.\n\nWe loved at Mitchell-Innes & Nash William Pope. L’s performance: three world leaders holding a huge-\nlooking meteorite excreting dye all over them at their own command......\n\nFrancis Chantala would not let me look at the Josh Smith paintings he was being most difficult.\n\nThere are some strange sights at art fairs: a woman artist dragging around a Louis Vuitton dustbin.\nPerhaps she was hoping someone would drop in a nice little unwanted designer package into her bin.\n\nWe dropped by to see Jim Lambie in his show in Paris. My amazing designer friend Jean Pierre Tortil,\nElliot Mcdonald and Jim.\n\nBack to London and we visited Wolfe Lenkiewicz at his show The House of the Noble Man. It was a very\nlovely show ina lavish £50 million home in Regents Park.\n\nWe found on the top floor a lovely work by Matthew Welch called In The Glass Coffin of the Virgin\nForest, the artist was one of Channel 4s New Sensations.\n\n35\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028315",
