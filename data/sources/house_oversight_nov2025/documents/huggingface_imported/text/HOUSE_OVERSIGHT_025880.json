I was the Island’s\n\nmanager\n\n> from 1999 through 2007 and lived on the Island with my\nwife\n\n> during that entire period. Regarding President\n\n> Clinton, I will sign a sworn affidavit that I never met\nthe\n\n> man. As far as I know President Clinton was never on\n> the Island. He was never there while I was present\n\non\n\n> the Island. If he had come to the Island while I was\n> on holiday, my staff would have told me that President\n> Clinton was on the Island while I was away. while I\n\n> worked on Little St. James, I had been called back\nfrom\n\n> holiday many times to help when any guests visited the\n> Island. So, if President Clinton had come to the\n\n> Island while I was away, I would have been called back\nto\n\nthe Island for such a visit, and I never was.\n\nThe same is true for Vice President Gore and his wife\nTipper. I never met them and as far as I am\n\naware were never on Little St. James during the entire\nperiod that I was the Island manager.\n\nv\n\nVVVVYV\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025880",
