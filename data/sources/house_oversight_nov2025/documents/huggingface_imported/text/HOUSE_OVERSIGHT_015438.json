  "text": "hours with virtually no sleep to finish on time. We received a rare\ncommendation and bonus from NASA for superior performance ahead of\n\nschedule and below budget.”\n\nGordon Cooper--one of those seven original astronauts—had\npiloted the longest and final Mercury space flight in 1963, becoming the\nfirst American to sleep in orbit. “He gave me a rare souvenir,” George\nreminds me, “a dehydrated oatmeal cookie the size of a large dice that he\nhad on a space mission. During a family dinner, | passed around the cookie\nfor everyone to see. Dad was hard of hearing and didn’ t hear the story,\nso he popped the space cookie into his mouth, and it was gone before |\ncould get any words out of my mouth. It was pure grief when it happened,\n\nbut funny now.”\n\nAs | write this in 2014, George is 85, and if a movie were to be made\nabout him, he’ d like to be portrayed by Matt Damon. In October 1988, he\nwas diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer and given three years to\nlive, but his daughter Devra, a naturopath, convinced him to meet with a\nmacrobiotic counselor, and overnight he changed his diet and\n\nlifestyle. Now it’ s twenty-six years later.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015438",
