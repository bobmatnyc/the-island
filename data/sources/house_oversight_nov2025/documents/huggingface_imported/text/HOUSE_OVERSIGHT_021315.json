  "text": "Sometimes just listening to laughter\ncompels listeners to laugh. Sometimes\nhearing a cry of terror directly imputes\nan instantaneous feeling of fear.\n\nHearing someone weep can produce a\nfeeling of sorrow and perhaps even\ncause one to cry. This suggests that\nsome forms of vocal communication can\nelicit direct empathic sharing as Decety\ndiscusses in his chapter.\n\nThese forms of vocal\ncommunication can produce direct\nresults in listeners without following a\nroute of symbolic reference and\ninterpretation.? Language has typically\nbeen viewed as operating by the more\nsymbolic route because of the linguistic\nclaim that symbols are not the things\nthey stand for and thus must be\nunderstood—words and sentences are\nnot felt. However, the right insult or\nangry words delivered in the right way\nor the right praise seems to be felt\ndirectly, perhaps through the same kind\nof mechanisms by which empathic\nsharing occurs.\n\nBut how is this achieved? This\nkind of impact of language is not a result\nof understanding the content of speech.\nIt reflects social goals and motives. To\nthe extent that this kind of social impact\nmay parallel empathic processes, we\nmight find that similar mechanisms are\ninvolved. Some kind of resonance must\nbe established between a speaker and\nhearer, and language can serve to\nestablish this resonance and lead to\nsubsequent action by the hearer. This\nidea of a resonance in an audience does\nseem more compatible with the effects\nof vocal behavior such as laughter or\ncrying on a listener than the symbolic\ninterpretative view. This notion of\nresonance may also be useful in\nunderstanding other kinds of language\nimpact from the fiery sermon of\n\nPage | 69\n\nEdwards to the passionate speeches of\nObama and Kennedy and King.\n\nIn listening to speech that has\nimpact, language has created a state in\nthe listener that reflects the intention of\nthe speaker. Whether it is fear or\nconnection, somehow language can\noperate as the medium by which social\nand emotional psychological states get\ntransmitted to an audience. But how\ndoes this impact get created in the social\nbrain?\n\nLanguage impact in the social brain\n\nUnderstanding spoken language\nhas typically been viewed as an analytic\nprocess in which sound patterns are\ntranslated into linguistic symbols by the\nbrain. However, an alternative theory is\nthat we understand spoken language by\nusing our motor system to simulate what\nmight have been said. The idea is that\ntrying to mentally produce the speech\ninternally (without talking) might help\nus understand what is said, when speech\nis not clear. However, this theory did\nnot have much neural plausibility.\nPeople do not generally move their\nmouths overtly or even covertly while\nlistening.\n\nThe discovery of mirror neurons,\nexamined at greater length by Steve\nSmall in the next chapter, suggested one\nkind of mechanism that might instantiate\nthis kind of process. In certain parts of\nthe brain, involved in the control of\naction, some neurons that respond when\nmaking certain actions also respond\nwhen observing the same actions. This\nled to the inference that these neurons\nare involved in understanding the\nbehavior of other people. The reasoning\nis simply that neural activity in the\nobserver’s motor system that results\nwhen seeing a behavior essentially\nestablishes the brain state that would\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021315",
