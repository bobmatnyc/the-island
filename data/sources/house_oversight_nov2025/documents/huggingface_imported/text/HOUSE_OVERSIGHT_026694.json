  "text": "Sovereigns are targeting markets offering security\nand growth\n\nTraditionally sovereigns have grouped countries by\neconomic development or geographic region to form\ntheir overall geographic allocations. Indeed, last\nyear, we highlighted increased allocations to North\nAmerica, based on perceptions of the US as a ‘safe\nhaven’ for sovereign assets, driven by the strength\n\nof its currency and positive tax changes for\ninternational investors.\n\nWhile at a high level, sovereigns have been\nunwilling to adjust regional allocations (as outlined in\ntheme 1), idiosyncratic geopolitical risks are causing\nsovereigns to reweight to countries within these\nallocation bands. In developed markets, uncertainty\nover global interest rates is shifting this focus to\nidentifying markets to shelter assets (as shown by\nthe increased attractiveness of the US and Germany\nin figure 7), with Brexit and the US election cited as\nthe factors of fastest growing importance to asset\nallocation (growing importance cited by 82% and\n68% of sovereigns respectively). Similarly, emerging\nmarkets sovereigns are identifying countries with the\ngreatest potential for long-term economic growth.\n\n14\n\nSovereigns are\nseeking greater\nexposure to\nperceived ‘safe\nhavens’ within each\nkey region.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026694",
