In 1980, Americans age 30 years or older\nhad 4.7 years more schooling on average than Americans in 1930--but Americans in 2005 had only 0.8 years more\nschooling on average than Americans in 1980 (24). Based on this data, it would appear the problem isn't that\n\ntechnology has leaped ahead--rather, the supply of educated workers has stalled.\n\nThe impact of income inequality on future generations of qualified workers is particularly disconcerting. Michael\nGreenstone, Adam Looney, Jeremy Patashnik, and Muxin Yu (Hamilton Project-Brookings) examined the effect that\nthe income divide in the U.S. could have on the future upward mobility of the country's children (25). They found that\ninvestments in education and skills, traits that increasingly decide job market success, are becoming more stratified by\n\nfamily income, threatening the earning potential of the youngest Americans.\n\nThese researchers note that, although cognitive tests of ability show little difference between children of high- and\nlow-income parents in the first years of their lives, \"large and persistent\" differences start to appear before kindergarten\nand widen throughout high school (26). Indeed, researchers have found that the gap in test results of children from\n\nfamilies at the 90th income percentile versus children of families at the 10th percentile has grown by about 40% over\n\nWWW.STANDARDANDPOORS.COM/RATINGSDIRECT AUGUST 5, 2014 10\n\n1351366 | 302136118\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025772",
