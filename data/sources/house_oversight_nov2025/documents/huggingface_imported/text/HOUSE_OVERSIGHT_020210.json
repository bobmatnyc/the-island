Snowden saw that a rogue system administrator like\nhimself could use his computer privileges to download and steal documents in ways that would go\nunnoticed. The emergence of a rogue system administrator was not that farfetched in 2009.\nHacktavists such as Julian Assange had adopted the battle cry: system administrators, or “syst\nadmins of the world unite.” Instead of asking them to “throw off their chains,” as Marx did, he\nasked them to send classified documents about secret government activity to the Wikileaks site.\nSnowden recalled in Moscow in 2014: “I actually recommended they [the NSA] move to two-\nman control for administrative access back in 2009.” To make his point even clearer, he added:\n“A whistleblower could use these things, but so could a spy.” Not without irony, Snowden\nhimself became that rogue system administrator some three years later at Dell. In fact, he later\nused the vulnerability he pointed out to steal NSA documents at Dell (before moving to Booz\nAllen.).\n\nIn September 2009, Snowden made a ten day trip to India. He later said he was on an official\nvisit “working at the US embassy.” He was still on the Dell payroll. Hotel records show that he\narrived at the Hyatt Regency hotel in New Delhi on September 2™ from Japan, and at 3:30 pm on\nSeptember 3\", checked into the Koenig Inn, a facility that was an annex to Koenig Solutions, a\nschool that gave crash courses on programming and computer hacking. According to Rohit\nAggarwal, the head of the school, Snowden stayed there until September 10\" while taking classes\nwith a private instructor. It cost $2,000 in tuition and fees, which Snowden prepaid from Japan\nwith his own personal credit card. Even though Snowden later said he only took courses in\n“programming,” the school’s records show that during that week he took intensive courses in\nsophisticated hacking techniques. Although the course was entitled “ethical hacking” that was\nalso a euphemism for teaching the techniques of illicit hacking. The course provided tutoring on\nhacker’s tools, such as “Spyeye” and “ZeuS,” that are used to circumvent security procedures. It\nalso demonstrated how these hacking tools could be customized by criminals and spies to break\ninto files, plant surveillance programs, impersonate system administrators, assume the privileges\nof system administrators in a network, and capture the passwords of others. On September 11\",\nSnowden, according to hotel records, left India for Japan. While the stated purpose of the\nhacking training was to allow security consultants to detect intruders, it also prepared Snowden\nto be, if he chooses to be, an intruder in the NSA system.\n\nOne problem with working as a contractor is that the standard two-year contracts are not\nnecessarily renewed, making a contractor’s job essentially temporary employment. Nor is there\nmuch possibility for advancement for IT workers. As one contractor told me “It is a dead end job\nwith great pay.” In the fall of 2010, Snowden’s contract in Japan with Dell SecureWorks came\nto anend. Dell then offered Snowden a new position in the United States.\n\nHe now was assigned to work at Dell headquarters in Annapolis, Maryland. He rented a modest\nsuburban house shaded by a Sakura cherry tree in suburb of Annapolis, Maryland. Mills\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020210",
