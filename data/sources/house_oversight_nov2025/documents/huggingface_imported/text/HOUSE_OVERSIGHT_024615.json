Tenet, the director of the Central Intelligence\nAgency, resigned in 2004 just “when the going got tough,” a decision\nhe calls “unfair to the president.” He wrote that he believes that\nSecretary of State Colin L. Powell tried to undermine President Bush\nby privately expressing doubts about the Iraq war, and he confirms\nthat he pushed to have Mr. Powell removed from the cabinet after the\n2004 election. “It was as though he thought the proper way to express\nhis views was by criticizing administration policy to people outside\nthe government,” Mr. Cheney writes. His resignation “was for the\nbest.”\n\nHe faults former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice for naiveté in\nthe efforts to forge anuclear weapons agreement with North Korea,\nand Mr. Cheney reports that he fought with White House advisers\nover softening the president’s speeches on Iraq.\n\nMr. Cheney acknowledged that the administration underestimated the\nchallenges in Iraq, but he said the real blame for the violence was\nwith the terrorists.\n\nHe also defends the Bush administration’s decision to inflict what he\ncalled “toughinterrogations” — like the suffocation technique known\nas waterboarding — on captured terrorism suspects, saying it\nextracted information that saved lives. He rejects portrayals of such\ntechniques as “torture.”\n\nIn discussing the much-disputed “16 words” about Iraq’s supposed\nhunt for uranium in Niger that were included in President Bush’s\n2003 State of the Union address to help justify the eventual invasion,\nMr. Cheney said that unlike other aides, he saw no need to apologize\nfor making that claim. He writes that Ms. Rice eventually came\naround to his view.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024615",
