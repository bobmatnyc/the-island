  "text": "Matthews then raised $44 million from EB-5 investors, according to a complaint by the Securities and\nExchange Commission. EB-5 is a federal program that allows foreign investors the chance to gain a green\n\ncard if they invest at least $500,000 into certain projects that create at least 10 jobs.\n\nThe SEC’s complaint said, however, that much of this money was misallocated to pay for Matthews’\npersonal expenses. Some of the funds allegedly went to pay for Mathews’ Connecticut home, his 151-\n\nfoot mega yacht, as well as to save his Palm Beach mansion from foreclosure, according to the complaint.\n\nIn a separate lawsuit filed by a group of EB-5 investors, the development group claimed that famous\ncelebrities and politicians such as Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, Celine Dion and Bill Koch — would serve\n\non the Palm House’s advisory board when, in fact, they did not.\n\nRelated Companies, led by Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross, developed CityPlace West Palm Beach.\nThe company is also proposing to build a 25-story office project called One Flagler in downtown West\nPalm Beach.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027069",
