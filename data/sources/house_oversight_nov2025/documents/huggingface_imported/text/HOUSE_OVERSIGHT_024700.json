Since the beginning of 2000, 24 more states and the\nDistrict of Columbia have passed medical cannabis laws that permit the production and possession of\ncannabis or concentrates for use in treating a broad range of qualifying medical conditions.\n\nA state medical cannabis law permits a patient, with a doctor's recommendation, to use cannabis to\ntreat any qualifying medical condition designated by the law. It is illegal for a doctor to “prescribe” a\nSchedule I controlled substance under the U.S. Controlled Substances Act (CSA), so medical cannabis\nlaws typically require a doctor’s “recommendation” rather than a prescription. Some medical cannabis\nlaws require a written recommendation, while others allow an oral recommendation. States may impose\na variety of other requirements or restrictions on a doctor or patient relating to medical cannabis access,\nsuch as patient registration with a state medical cannabis registry, submission of a patient's fingerprints\nor prohibition of use by convicted felons or certain government employees (for example, firefighters).\n\nThe number and nature of qualifying conditions included in medical cannabis laws vary widely.\nSome laws designate relatively few or highly specific medical conditions, while other laws include many\nconditions or highly subjective conditions, such as chronic pain. Some medical cannabis laws also\ngive doctors discretion to recommend cannabis for conditions not specifically designated. In aggre-\ngate, across all medical cannabis laws in the United States, cannabis is legally recognized as a form of\ntherapy or medicine for more than 50 qualifying conditions. Common qualifying conditions include\nAlzheimer’s disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), anorexia, arthritis, cachexia, cancer, chronic\npain, Crohn’s disease, epilepsy, glaucoma, hepatitis C, HIV/AIDS, inflammation, migraine, multiple\nsclerosis (MS), nausea, nervous system degeneration, Parkinson’s disease, post-traumatic stress disorder\n(PTSD) and spasms.\n\nSome medical cannabis laws restrict the form of cannabis or the means of consumption. For example,\nPennsylvania's medical cannabis law, enacted in 2016, prohibits smoking or vaporizing cannabis\nflower, prohibits the incorporation of cannabis into foods by anyone other than the patient or the\npatient’s caregiver, and authorizes cannabis to be dispensed only in certain concentrated forms.\n\nMedical cannabis laws generally permit cannabis cultivation and distribution by a state-licensed\ncultivator or dispensary, by a qualified patient or by a designated caregiver of the patient. A qualified\npatient or the patient’s designated caregiver generally may grow only an amount of cannabis deemed\nsufficient for the patient’s personal use. Some medical cannabis laws permit patients or caregivers to\ngrow cannabis only if they cannot practically obtain it by other means. For example, certain states\npermit patients to grow cannabis only if they reside more than a specified distance from the nearest\nlicensed dispensary. Some states allow qualified patients and designated caregivers to collectively or\ncooperatively aggregate their cultivation activities.\n\nState-licensed cultivators and dispensaries must satisfy various licensing requirements related to\nhealth, safety and security. In states that permit or require vertical integration, a licensee may be part\n\n64 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024700",
