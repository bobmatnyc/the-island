  "text": "10\n\namong Arabs who already suspect Turkey of harboring a so-called\nneo-Ottoman agenda. Turkey's ardent support for Libyan rebels\nagainst Moammar Gadhafi and public backing for Syrian opposition\nforces have already unnerved Arab monarchist regimes that are trying\nto undermine the effects of the Arab Spring and are growing\ndistrustful of Turkish intentions. Moreover, any move construed as\nTurkey trying to facilitate the downfall of the al Assad regime would\nundoubtedly create problems with Iran, a neighbor Turkey has taken\ngreat care to avoid aggravating. Iran relies heavily on the Alawite\nregime in Syria to maintain a foothold in the Levant through groups\nlike Hezbollah in Lebanon and Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas\nin the Gaza Strip. Since the return of Syria to Sunni control would\nunravel a key pillar of Iranian deterrent strategy, we can expect that\nIran is doing everything possible to undermine the very Syrian\nopposition forces looking to Ankara for support. Turkey has avoided\nconfrontation with Iran thus far while working quietly to build a\nSunni counterbalance to Iranian-backed Shia in Iraq in the face of an\nimpending U.S. withdrawal. A power vacuum in Syria filled by\nTurkish-backed Sunnis would reinforce a nascent confrontation\nbetween Iran and Turkey with deep geopolitical underpinnings.\nNations do not have friends; they have interests. And Turkey, an\nhistorically influential country sitting on one of the most\ngeopolitically complex pieces of real estate in the world, is now\nfinding that a foreign policy built on avoiding problems with\nneighbors grinds against reality. In STRATFOR's view, this was\ninevitable, which is why we took interest in Monday's issue of\nToday's Zaman, an English-language outlet loyal to the movement of\nFethullah Gulen and strongly supportive of the ruling AKP. Two\neditorials in Monday's publication held that the Syrian crisis has\nexposed the coming demise of Turkey's \"zero problems with\nneighbors\" policy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030165",
