The Polish Intelligence Bureau badly needed\nto know what the German army was planning and had recruited this\ngroup of young mathematicians as code breakers. Up to this point, code-\nbreaking had been the domain of linguists able to see word patterns\nin apparently random sets of letters. The arrival of electro-mechanical\nmachines made this method redundant, and code-breaking had become\nthe domain of mathematical minds. The British, French, and American\nintelligence agencies were all hard at work deciphering the German\ncodes, but only the Polish group, motivated by the imminent threat of\ninvasion, had made real progress. The code they were breaking: ‘Enigma.\nAs with many inventions, Enigma got off to a difficult start. The\ninventor, Arthur Scherbius, tried to sell it to the army but they rejected it\nsaying it did not provide any real military benefit. Instead, the machine\nwent into service transmitting commercial shipping manifests. However,\nsome senior figures in the German military had not forgotten the lesson\nof the First World War. During that war, the German army suffered\nmajor setbacks because the British broke all their codes early on. With\nthe onset of World War II, Rommel ordered the German Army and Navy\nto deploy modern coding machines. The previously rejected Enigma was\nrapidly pressed into service and, all of a sudden, Europe went dark to\nAllied Intelligence. The man to lead the task of breaking Enigma for the\nEnglish was Alan Turing.\n\nI: is 1943 and a small group of Polish mathematicians sit, ears glued\n\nAlan Turing\n\nAlan Turing was conceived in India but born in London in early 1912.\nHe was precocious from an early age and an extraordinarily determined\ncharacter. His first day at Public School, Sherborne in Dorset, coincided\nwith the British General Strike of 1926. With no public transport available,\nthe thirteen-year-old Turing cycled the 60 miles to school, staying in a\nguesthouse on the way and earning a write-up in his local newspaper.\nTuring went on to study Mathematics at King’s College, Cambridge and\nwas made a Fellow at only 22. In 1936 Turing, aged 24, published On\nComputable Numbers and their Application to the Entscheidungsproblem,\nnot a snappy title, but one of the most influential mathematical works of\nthe 20\" century. The paper described the new the science of computing\nand solved Hilbert’s “Entscheidungsproblem, a mathematical puzzle\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015901",
