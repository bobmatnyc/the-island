As a result, she took elaborate countermeasures to evade\nany possible surveillance of her communications.\n\nSnowden knew about this incident because Greenwald described\nit in great detail in a blog that Snowden read (as he later told Green-\nwald). “Poitras is now forced to take extreme steps—ones that ham-\nper her ability to do her work,” Greenwald wrote. “She now avoids\ntraveling with any electronic devices. She uses alternative methods\nto deliver the most sensitive parts of her work—raw film and inter-\nview notes—to secure locations. She spends substantial time and\nresources protecting her computers with encryption and password\ndefenses. Especially when she is in the US, she avoids talking on\nthe phone about her work, particularly to sources. And she sim-\nply will not edit her films at her home out of fear—obviously well\ngrounded—that government agents will attempt to search and seize\nthe raw footage.” She claimed, as she told journalists, she was the\nvictim of “Kafkaesque government harassment.”\n\nSnowden was duly impressed with her concerns about govern-\n\n© ment surveillance, which he agreed was ubiquitous. Indeed, he later ®\ndescribed her as “more paranoid when it comes to electronic security\nthan I can be.” He meant it as a compliment. Such functional para-\nnoia or “operational security,” as Greenwald would call the precau-\ntions that she took, dovetailed with Snowden’s growing conviction\nthat universal encryption was necessary to defeat the surveillance\nstate. It also made her the perfect channel for Snowden to safely pass\nsome of the classified documents he stole to Greenwald and other\njournalists.\n\nIt was not difficult to get her to cooperate in his plot. He wrote,\nfor example, “The surveillance you've experienced means you have\nbeen ‘selected’—a term which will mean more to you as you learn\nhow the modern SIGINT [signals intelligence] system works.” Just\nas she had been “chosen” by her work to act as his conduit, accord-\ning to Snowden, she had been chosen by the NSA as a target because\nof her work. The idea of her being “selected” by an invisible signals\nintelligence agency, the NSA, could only excite her longtime con-\ncerns about being watched by the government.\n\n“Your victimization by the NSA system means that you are well\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 65 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019553",
