  "text": "the key terms and ideas expressed in that\nchapter. Each chapter, in turn,\nrepresents a contribution led by a\nparticular member to the network but\nbroadened to reflect the interactions of\nthe network on that topic. Perusal of the\nword clouds across chapters makes the\nflow of ideas more visible. Together,\nthe chapters speak to who we are as a\nspecies and the nature of the invisible\nforces that make us such a unique\nspecies. For instance, humans seem to\nstrive for social connections in a variety\nof ways from friendships to\nidentification with groups to religious\naffiliations. A major thesis of this book\nis that we are fundamentally a social\nspecies, and that this journey is less a\nmarch toward isolation and autonomy\n\n6\n\nPage\n\nthan it is a march to competence,\ninterdependence, coordination,\ncooperation, and social resilience.\nGuiding us through this journey are our\nsocial brains, which have evolved to\ncreate anything but a blank slate at birth.\n\nWe owe a debt of thanks to many\nfor their contributions and support over\nthe years, but we owe special thanks to\nBarnaby Marsh for approaching us with\nthe idea of forming such a network and\nfor his many contributions to the\nnetwork, and to the John Templeton\nFoundation for their support and for their\nencouragement to pursue questions,\nideas, and conclusions of our science\nregardless of where they led.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021252",
