She’s made the whole story up out of whole cloth.” ;\n\nBradley Edwards had already become involved in lawsuits\nagainst Epstein. In 2007, working with a former federal judge\nand University of Utah law professor named Paul Cassell, he had\nGled a lawsuit on behalf of another unnamed woman. Six years\nlater, that case is still pending, and now, Edwards and Cassell i\npetition to have the two suits combined.\n\nAllin all, four Jane Does take part in the lawsuit.\n\nJane Doe 3 is Virginia Roberts, the girl who says that Ghis-\nlaine Maxwell recruited her for Epstein at Trump's resort,\nMar-a-Lago.\n\nEpstein had “lent” her and other young girls to prominent\nbusinessmen, important politicians, world leaders, and other  s\npowerful men in order “to ingratiate himself with them for busi-\n\nness, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain\n\nblackmail information,” Roberts claims.\n\nShe says that Epstein forced her and other underage girls to\ntake part in an orgy in the Virgin Islands.\n\nShe names Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz as two of the 4\nmen she'd been forced to have sex with and claims that Der 9\nshowitz had been “an eyewitness to the sexual abuse of many q\nother minors by Epstein and several of Epstein's co-conspirators. 7\n\nThis time, Prince Andrew does respond to the allegations. a\n\n“This relates to longstanding and ongoing civil proceedings P\nin the United States, to which the Duke of York is not a party,”\nBuckingham Palace says in a short statement. “As such we would ,\nnot comment on the detail. However, for the avoidance of doubly\n\nany suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is catego if\n\nna\n4\n\ncally untrue.” 3\nig\n\nAlan Dershowitz also ;\nare part of a plot to exto\nEdwards and Cassell have {\nhe’s ever seen.\n\n“They manipulated a y\ninterested in money,” Ders\noffense, and they will be d:\never made this false charge\n\nBut then, the allegations m\n15, 2015, in a declaration\nattempt to overturn Jeffrey E\nare highly disturbing.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022049",
