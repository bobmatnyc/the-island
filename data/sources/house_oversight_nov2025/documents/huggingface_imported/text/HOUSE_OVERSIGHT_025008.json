We would have to come back\nand put the question to the leadership. There were nine ideas\npresented about what to do if America vetoes. Was going to the\nGeneral Assembly discussed? Yes. Was throwing in the towel\ndiscussed? Yes. Maybe we'll make a decision about that in the next\ntwo weeks.\n\nThrowing in the towel? You mean disbanding the Palestinian\nAuthority?\n\nThe Authority was born to transfer Palestinians from occupation to\nindependence. If Mr. [Benjamin] Netanyahu [the Israeli prime\nminister] thinks he can make this Authority in name only while he is\nthe sole master and source of authority, he will sweat. If we get a\n[U.S.] veto and Netanyahu continues to build the settlements, I would\nsuggest that Netanyahu study carefully the provisions of the Hague\nConvention of 1907 and the Geneva Convention of 1949 which\nspecify the responsibilities of the occupying power.\n\nIf you fail in the Security Council and don't at least upgrade in\n\nthe General Assembly, won't you risk looking like a failure in the\neyes of Palestinians, particularly after all this buildup? Have you\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025008",
