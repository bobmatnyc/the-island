  "text": "She was staying at a house in San Francisco owned by actress\nWynona Rider, whose godfather was Timothy Leary. He had been Anita’ s\nrole model during the final months of A/s life. “You couldn’ t choose how\nand when and with whom you were born,” he said, “but you can take\ncharge of your own death.” And that’ s exactly what she was now doing.\n\nRobin Williams learned about Anita’ s situation from his co-star in\nGood Will Hunting, Matt Damon, who had been told about it by his\ngirlfriend, Wynona. Robin had never met Anita, but he called and offered\nto pay a visit, in keeping with his benign case of Patch Adams Syndrome.\nAfter all, if Patch could travel to Trinidad to entertain murderers who\nwould be hanged three days later, why shouldn’ t it be appropriate for\nRobin to make Anita laugh on Christmas day? She hesitated— “l’ ve\nnever really been a fan of his work,” she thought—but then invited him to\nvisit...\n\nAnd so it came to pass in 2014 that Robin Williams would also\ncommit suicide. In the midst of mass mourning him, Rush Limbaugh\nexplained that “Leftists are never happy.” And the anti-choice Lifenews\nclaimed that Robin killed himself out of guilt over an abortion his girlfriend\n\nhad in the 1970s.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015383",
