  "text": "CHAPTER 5:\n\nSOME ENTHEOGENIC ENTROPIES\n\nIn the spring of 1968, members of my laboratory team were looking for new\nbrain metabolic pathways of the essential amino acid tryptophan, the dietary\nprecursor of the human mood, sleep and libidinal neurotransmitter, serotonin. After\nstruggling for several months to identify an apparently new compound, which turned\nout not to be new but only new in the brain, we collected evidence for a human\nbrain enzyme that could catalyze the production of an LSD-like hallucinogen,\ndimethyltryptamine, DMT. Tracing its metabolic origins, we found that DMT was\nderived from tryptamine, a common metabolite of the essential and omnipresent\namino acid, tryptophan. This enzyme and its metabolic product were located in\nhighest concentrations in brain stem systems that influence the neural regulation of\nthe heart, blood pressure, temperature, breathing, vomiting and primitive approach-\navoidance behavior. It was also found in limbic brain nuclei thought to modulate the\nemotional coloring of perception and thought. Richard Wyatt, working at the\nNational Institutes of Mental Health found DMT in the urine of schizophrenic\nhumans. He also showed that DMT increased significantly if tryptamine’s normal\n\npathway for degradation was blocked by monoamine oxidase inhibitors, such as\n\n87\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013587",
