  "text": "The continuing recession and further steep job losses are wearing away the patience of Americans and raising doubts about Obama's\nhandling of the economy.\n\nThe share of Americans who believe the stimulus package will restore the economy slipped to 52 percent in late June, down from 59\npercent two months earlier, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll.\n\nVice President Joe Biden said the administration had \"misread\" how bad the economy was when it took office but that the stimulus\npackage would help the economy recovery and create jobs.\n\nSenate Republican Leader Mich McConnell Friday called the stimulus plan a failure.\n\nObama said it takes time for the plan's money \"to get out the door\" to pay for roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects that will\ncreate jobs \"because we are committed to spending it in a way that is effective and transparent.\"\n\n2 ok ok ok Ie ee ok ok Ik ee oe ok ok Ik a oe ok 2k ok Ie oe ok ok ok ak oe ok ok ok Ik oe ek ok OK KKK DOT SCLA TIMER * ® & & & 2% eo ok Ie a ek ok ok Ie oe oe ok ok ok Ik oe ok ok ok Ik I oe\n\nKK RK KKK KK\n\nThis email and any files transmitted with it are confidential and contain privileged or\nopyright\nnformation.
