  "text": "was especially upset because my attitude seemed to be infecting others. A few\nmonths into the school year, he told the leaders of Mishmar Hasharon, and then\nmy parents, that I would have to leave. My father was especially upset. A\ncouple of years earlier, he’d had visions of my staying on in the regional high\nschool and going to university. Now, I’d been unable to hold my own in Rupin.\nStill, both he and my mother were relieved when Mishmar Hasharon and the\nschool worked out a compromise which did not end my studies altogether. The\nexpulsion stood, but I was allowed to continue attending math and science\nclasses.\n\nFor my mother, the blow was softened by the fact I began working almost\nfull-time on the kibbutz, alongside Yigal, driving a tractor. I woke up early and\naccompanied him into the fields of wheat, barley or rye. We also made a series\nof trips 130 miles south into the Negev to a moshav called Patish. It had been\nset up by newly arrived Moroccan Jews. Since they didn’t have the equipment\nor know-how to cultivate all their fields, they were renting out some of the land.\nMishmar Hasharon had contracted to farm a parcel of 450 acres.\n\nFor ten days at a time, Yigal and I would place a tractor on the back of a\npickup and head to Patish. We worked from four in the morning until sundown.\nAfter work, we ate at a tiny family-run restaurant a few miles away in Ofakim, a\nso-called “development town” populated by Moroccan Jews who had been\nmoved there as soon as they arrived in Israel. Far from regretting not being in\nschool, I drew satisfaction, and pride, from knowing that I was functioning as an\nindependent adult. But it also gave me time to think. My whole life had been\ncircumscribed by the struggle to create and secure the state. But I again found\nmyself pondering issues of basic fairness in our young country, and the\nchallenge of reconciling our words and principles with our deeds amid the\ndifficult realities of building the state.\n\nBack on the kibbutz, it was the example of the kindly and hard-working\nBaddura which had caused me to question how we were treating the Jews who\nhad arrived from Yemen. In the Negev, I met members of the even larger post-\nwar influx from Morocco. One image struck me above all. It was from the place\nYigal and I ate dinner. Ofakim was a development town that had yet to develop.\nIt had no visible means of support, and there was no sign the government was\ndoing much to remedy that or integrate the new immigrants economically and\nsocially. The “restaurant” was a side business a family had set up in the dining\nroom of their tiny home. The sixth or seventh time we went there, I was startled\nby sudden movement a couple of feet away from where we were sitting.\n\n46\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027894",
