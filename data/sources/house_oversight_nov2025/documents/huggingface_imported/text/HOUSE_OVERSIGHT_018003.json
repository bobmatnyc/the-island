His father worked for the city’s parks department. His parents\nviewed education as “the way out” for him and his younger brother, Mark, now working in real\nestate. Jeffrey started to play the piano—for which he maintains a passion—at five, and he went\nto Brooklyn’s Lafayette High School. He was good at mathematics, and in his early 20s he got a\njob teaching physics and math at Dalton, the elite Manhattan private school. While there he\nbegan tutoring the son of Bear Stearns chairman Ace Greenberg and was friendly with a\ndaughter of Greenberg’s. Soon he went to Bear Stearns, where, under the mentorship of both\nGreenberg and current Bear Stearns C.E.O. James Cayne, he did well enough to become a\nlimited partner—a rung beneath full partner. He abruptly departed in 1981 because, he has said,\nhe wanted to run his own business.\n\nThereafter the details recede into shadow. A few of the handful of current friends who have\nknown him since the early 1980s recall that he used to tell them he was a “bounty hunter,”\nrecovering lost or stolen money for the government or for very rich people. He has a license to\ncarry a firearm. For the last 15 years, he’s been running his business, J. Epstein & Co.\n\nSince Leslie Wexner appeared in his life—Epstein has said this was in 1986; others say it was in\n1989, at the earliest—he has gradually, in a way that has not generally made headlines, come to\nbe accepted by the Establishment. He’s a member of various commissions and councils: he is on\nthe Trilateral Commission, the Council on Foreign Relations, the New York Academy of\nSciences, and the Institute of International Education.\n\nHis current fan club extends to Cayne, Henry Rosovsky, the former dean of Harvard’s Faculty of\nArts and Sciences, and Larry Summers, Harvard’s current president. Harvard law professor Alan\nDershowitz says, “I’m on my 20th book.... The only person outside of my immediate family that\nI send drafts to is Jeffrey.” Real-estate developer and philanthropist Marshall Rose, who has\nworked with Epstein on projects in New Albany, Ohio, for Wexner, says, “He digests and\ndecodes the information very rapidly, which is to me terrific because we have shorter meetings.”\n\nAlso on the list of admirers are former senator George Mitchell and a gaggle of distinguished\nscientists, most of whom Epstein has helped fund in recent years. They include Nobel Prize\nwinners Gerald Edelman and Murray Gell-Mann, and mathematical biologist Martin Nowak.\nWhen these men describe Epstein, they talk about “energy” and “curiosity,” as well as a love for\ntheoretical physics that they don’t ordinarily find in laymen. Gell-Mann rather sweetly mentions\nthat “there are always pretty ladies around” when he goes to dinner chez Epstein, and he’s under\nthe impression that Epstein’s clients include the Queen of England. Both Nowak and Dershowitz\nwere thrilled to find themselves shaking the hand of a man named “Andrew” in Epstein’s house.\n“Andrew” turned out to be Prince Andrew, who subsequently arranged to sit in the back of\nDershowitz’s law class.\n\nEpstein gets annoyed when anyone suggests that Wexner “made him.” “I had really rich clients\nbefore,” he has said. Yet he does not deny that he and Wexner have a special relationship.\nEpstein sees it as a partnership of equals. “People have said it’s like we have one brain between\ntwo of us: each has a side.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018003",
