  "text": "The girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what\nthey regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution\n\nagreement have prospered.\nBY MARTA OLIVER CRAVIOTTO & | EMILY MICHOT & | JULIEK.BROWN &\n\nBy December, Epstein had still not agreed to a date for his plea hearing, and was\ntechnically in violation of the September agreement, which required him to\nappear in court by November, Acosta noted in a letter to Kenneth Starr in\nDecember 2007.\n\n“The [U.S. attorneys] who have been negotiating with defense counsel have for\nsome time complained to me regarding the tactics used by the defense team,”\nAcosta wrote. “It appears to them that as soon as resolution is reached on one\nissue, defense counsel finds ways to challenge the resolution collaterally. ... Some\nin our office are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to mount\ncollateral challenges to provisions to the agreement, even after Mr. Epstein has\nentered his guilty plea and thus rendered the agreement difficult, if not\nimpossible, to unwind.”\n\nAnd that’s exactly what happened.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016453",
