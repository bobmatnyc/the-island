Tourism is a very promising field. The Island, very beautiful and with dozens of beaches,\nhas at least 14 points on both coasts that are potentially transformable into ideal sites\nfor building tourism poles similar to Puerto Banus in Spain or Casa de Campo in La\nRomana, Dominican Republic.\n\n5. Considering the number of researchers in the field of medicine, totally under-utilized,\nthe country would potentially be the perfect partner of large international\npharmaceutical industries, to both develop new medications and produce them.\n\n6. Given the prestige (today somewhat reduced) of its health system, Cuba is potentially an\nexcellent site for medical tourism and a place to establish links with the North American\ninsurance systems. Havana is much closer to Key West than Miami is to Orlando in\nFlorida.\n\n7. Whenever relations are really normalized and travel is facilitated and multiplies, Cuba\nwill become an ideal place to retire for tens of thousands of Cuban Americans and North\nAmericans who perceive an average of USS1,800 a month.\n\n8. Cuba receives some three million tourists every year, and has eleven million inhabitants.\nIn a few years it could receive eleven million tourists and reach the classification of\nparadise. A few daring and intelligent developers could transform the Isle of Pines, in\nCuba’s south, into the Mallorca of the Caribbean. In the United States there are 300,000\nluxury yachts that could visit Cuba and dock in already existing as well as future marinas.\n\n9. If relations between the United States and Cuba continue to deepen, it’s possible to\nforesee a Free Trade Agreement that would allow the Island unlimited exports to the\nrichest market in the world.\n\n10. Because of its geographical position, Cuba is an ideal hub for the distribution of ocean-\ngoing and air cargo to North and South America.\n11. Cuban-Americans, as occurred in the case of Taiwan and China, could transfer to Cuba\n\ntheir business expertise, their relationships, and the capital they've created, which\nwould integrate the Island into the business and trade world of the United States.\n\n12. The country, as happened in post-Communist Europe, would be the paradise of the best-\nknown North American fast-foot franchises such as MacDonalds, Burger King, KFC, etc..\n13. The same thing would occur with department store chains: Zara, Corte Inglés, Macys,\n\nSears, and the rest of the best known establishments.\nWeaknesses\n\n1. The government of Raul Castro doesn’t want a regime change but rather an\nimprovement of the Communist model initiated in 1959. According to published and\nverbal statements, the model foreseen isn’t even the Chinese or Vietnamese model, but\nrather a Military Capitalism of State, where the government reserves the control of the\n2,500 largest enterprises in the country, which it exploits directly through the military\napparatus or in partnership with foreign capitalists. Cubans will not have access to the\nmeans of production, but rather to small service enterprises (small food businesses,\nbeauty salons, etc.).\n\n2. The government of Raul Castro does not believe, as Deng Xiaoping proclaimed in 1992,\nthat “enriching oneself is glorious.” Raul and Fidel continue to believe that capitalism is\nan evil expression of the worst human tendencies, and despite those who practice it. In\nCuba, entrepreneurs are not encouraged, but discouraged. Capitalists may be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025096",
