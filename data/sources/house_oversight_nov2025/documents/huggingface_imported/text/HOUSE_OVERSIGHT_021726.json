Ryan, Production Director\n\nOnneka Challenger, Circulation Director\nKevin Downey, Advertising Director\nHedy Szabo, Business Manager\n\nWhat a city owes its residents\n\nThough it is the biggest city in -\n\nU.S. history to file for bankruptcy,\nDetroit is only one of 26 urban\nmunicipalities that have gone into\nbankruptcy or state receivership for\nfiscal insolvency since 2008. Detroit\nshould draw attention and debate to\na challenging issue underlying all\nthese public insolvencies: What\nlevel of public services will we pro-\ntect and guarantee for U.S. cities?\nThe Bankruptcy Court will have\nto face that question. It will have to\n\ndetermine whether Detroit can cut\n\ninto current services any more than\nit already has. Unless the state or\nfederal government steps in with\nfunds for operating costs, the bank-\nruptcy will function as a zero-sum\ngame, with residents fighting credi-\ntors for a share of city revenue.\nCreditors have contracts to monetize\nwhat they are seeking, but how\nshould the court determine the pub-\nlic spending that residents need\ntoday ‘and tomorrow?\n\nPoliticians and judges who man-\nage local fiscal crises speak of\nmaintaining basic services and\nensuring residents’ minimal health\nand safety, but these concepts are\nshort on specifics. While our laws\nprovide an entitlement to a public\neducation, and we have long strug-\ngled to interpret what constitutes a\nlegally adequate education, there is\nlittle to nothing that would tell us\nwhat other services the local public\nsector must provide.\n\n’ As a matter of law, there is no\nsuch thing as a crime rate that is too\nhigh or an ambulance response time\nthat is too long. Should there be?\n\nFor nov, it is left to politics and\nmoral judgment to determine wheth-\ner it is acceptable that less than one\nin three streetlights are operational\nin Detroit or that the city has 80,000\nabandoned and blighted structures\nthat it cannot afford to demolish. In\nDetroit, as in many other struggling\ncities, dramatic police layoffs mean\nthat the average wait time after a\n911 call for a police officer is 58\nminutes, and a resident can rarely\nsummon an officer at all if the\n\n. reported crime is not in progress and\nviolent.\n\nAs for other public functions that\na high-poverty city (especially one\nwith severe winters) might hope to\nhave — such as reliable bus ser-\nvice, playground equipment, indoor\nbasketball courts, after-school pro-\ngrams, active libraries and commu-\nnity centers for the elderly — these\n\nMichelle Wilde Anderson\n\nservices are decades into deep cuts «\nand widespread closures. Indeed,\nhaving curtailed everything beyond\nemergency services, it would be\ntempting to refer to a government\nlike Detroit’s as a night-watchman\nstate — the libertarian ideal of a\ngovernment focused only on public\nsafety.\n\nThat is, we’d be tempted ‘to use\nsuch a term for Detroit, and cities\nlike it, were it notsuch a cruel irony:\nDetroit had more than 15,200 vio-\nlent crimes and. 500 acts of arson in\n2012. The night watchmen are\nunderstaffed and underpaid.\nAccording to a 2012 study by econ-\nomists Aaron Chalfin and Justin\nMcCrary, public spending in Detroit\non each police officer (including all\nwages, benefits and retirement costs)\nis less than two-thirds what it is just\n45 miles away in the prosperous\nuniversity town of Ann Arbor.\n\nAs a political and moral matter, as\nmuch as a legal one, Detroit repre-\nsents an opportunity to take a stand.\nfor urban habitability. What belongs\non our list of minimum standards for\na city? Detroit invites us to have a\npublic conversation about what ser-\nvices and public spaces we expect\nfrom city governments for human\ndignity and for humans to flourish.\nWe have a chance to say that no one\nshould have to wait hopelessly for\nan ambulance, that a violent crime\nin a neighbothood every few hours\nis intolerable. ;\n\nPaying for such commitments\nshould not just be the burden of\ncreditors. Many of the city’s credi-\ntors are rank-and-file public employ-\nees and retirees who have counted\non a public pension and are not eli-\ngible for Social Security. Detroit’s\nbankruptcy plan could send them\ninto poverty in their old age.\n\nBasic services and safety in our\ncities are the responsibility of\nstates, the federal government, the\nprivate sector and voters. It is all of\nthem — all of us — who have a\nrole to play in the stabilization that\nDetroit:is seeking through bank-\nruptcy. All of us have a responsibil-\nity to help them give basic health\nand safety real meaning, and to\nmake this bankruptcy a safety net,\nnot a punishment.\n\n— Michelle Wilde Anderson is.an\nassistant professor of law at UC\nBerkeley School of Law.\n\nOPINIONS\n\nMonday, July 29, 2013\n\nMrs. Anthony Weiner is Hillary 2.1\n\nI sat there watching the television\nscreen as Anthony Weiner squirmed\nbefore the microphones for the second\ntime in two years, and realized that\nthis was a deja vu moment.\n\nAt first I thought it was because the\nformer congressman and aspiring\nmayoral candidate was, once again,\napologizing for tweeting and cheating\nwithout really meeting. And then I\ntook one look at Weiner’s wife and\nrealized that this had absolutely noth-\ning to do with the fellow.\n\nHuma Abedin might have creamy\nolive skin, beautiful brown eyes and\nlong dark hair, but you don’t need to\nput her in a pantsuit and slap a head-\nband on her tresses to realize that we\nate now in the presence of Hillary\nClinton, version 2.1.\n\nWe all remembet the pre-Senate,\npre-State Department Hillary who\ninspired both awe and revulsion for\nher assault on the East Wing. Never\nbefore had we been treated to a first\nlady who so. blatantly and brazenly\nsought equal status with the guy we’d\nactually elected.\n\nEleanor Roosevelt, her idol, had\nexercised a considerable amount of\nweight behind the scenes. But it\nwasn’t until Franklin died that she\nreally came into her own. Not so Mrs.\nClinton, or, rather, Mrs. Rodham\nClinton.\n\nIt was painfully obvious to anyone\npaying attention that Bill’s wife was\nhell bent on giving us that two-for-one\nbargain that the couple had promised\nduring the campaign. Say what you\nwill about her, Hillary was a force to\nbe reckoned with. And praised. And\nloathed. Even her most strident ene-\nmies didn’t underestimate her survival\ninstincts.\n\nHealth care? (If at first you don’t\n\nsucceed ... .) Whitewater? (Did any-_\n\nTHE CAUSE OF DEATH\n\nChristine M. Flowers\n\none say rafting?) Vince Foster?\n(Personal tragedy, nothing more.) And\nthen came the stream of women:\nGennifer (no relation,) Paula (a genu-\nine victim) and, of course, “A little bit\nof Monica.”\n\nAnyone who thought that Hillary\nwas going to let the Bimbo Bombs\ndestroy her carefully constructed plans\nclearly didn’t know just who they\nwere dealing with. Our first lady stood\nby her philandering man and rode the\ncrest of a sympathetic wave into the\nSenate. Mrs. Wynette Goes To\nWashington, so to speak.\n\n~ And who did she take with her on\nthat long and fruitful journey, ever\nupward, ever more successfully? Why\nnone other than Mrs. Weiner, the love-\nly, inscrutable Huma.\n\nHillary once said that she had one\ndaughter, but that.ifshe had another it\nwould be her béloved personal\nassistant.\n\nHumaAbedin has been by her men-\ntor’s side for almost two decades, and\nit is yeasonable to think thatshe spent\na large part of that time taking notes\nabout how to thrive and survive in the\npolitical jungle. Therefore, it is not\nsurprising that she (1) chose tomany\nan animal indigenous to that environ-\nment i.e., a cheetah, and (2) figured\nout how to make sure that she could\nwithstand whatever wounds he man-\naged to inflict on their shared\nambitions.\n\nAnthony’s wife has taken a page\nfrom her pseudo-mama’s dog-eared\nbook and has perfected the art of dam-\nage control.\n\nFirst, you assume a posture of dig-\nnified disappointment, wherein your\nwhole body seems to just “‘sigh” under\n\nWAS DEBT, POLITICS\nAND UNFUNDED\n\n> PENSION\n\n5S. ff\nPty\n\nthe weight of the offensive conduct.\nIt’s a cross between an “I can’t believe\nhe did this to me” and a “boys will be\nboys, God bless their randy little\nhearts.” Then, you gaze sadly at the\nperpetrator as he stares into the cam-\nera and apologizes for the second,\nthird or 13th time for being a pervert\nwith his privates. Then, you allow him\nto draw a line in the sand where he\nsays he might be sorry but he won’t\ngo gentleinto that good campaign and\nis continuing to seek the mayoral\nprize. :\n\nAnd then you spring into action.\nYou straighten your shoulders, raise\nyoun pointed chin, allow a few wisps\nof that luxuriant velvet hair to fall\nacross your delicately drawn cheek\nand assume a stoic pose. You love-\nhim, you say. You believe in him, you\nsay. You forgive him, you say. You\nidiot, we say.\n\nBut you do not hear us speaking,\nbecause you do not care what the pea-\nnut gallery thinks. This is not about\nthe crowds massed to watch this pub-\nlic shaming. This is not even about\nyour husband who, truth be told, is\nprobably sleeping in the garage these\ndays, which is why he has both the\ntime and the inclination to tweet.\n\nThis is about something far more\nimportant to you, perhaps almost as\nimportant as the future of the child\nyou and the Tweeter have in common.\nThis is about your political survival.\n\nHuma Abedin learned at the feet of\na master, someone who might very\nwell parlay her experience as scored\nwife into an office in the West Wing.\nHuma is a bit more modest, of course.\nSeems she’d be content to redecorate\nGracie Mansion.\n\n— Christine M. Flowers is a lawyer\nand columnist for the Philadelphia\nDaily News.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021726",
