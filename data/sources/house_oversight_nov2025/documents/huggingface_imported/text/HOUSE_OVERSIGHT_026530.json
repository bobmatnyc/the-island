  "text": "“When the facts change, I change my mind. What do you do, sir?” However, if policies\nbased on conviction or consistency over time are signals that a candidate does not look\nat the benefits of cooperation, this is an indication that the candidate can be trusted in\nsituations where making the decision that is right for his or her constituency comes at\na large political cost. Consistent with this, opponents take every opportunity to paint\ncandidates as flip-floppers who cannot be trusted [21]. This argument generalizes outside\nof politics to why we respect people who are “principled” over those who are “strategic”.\n\nPeople intuitively cooperate. That is, when people make decisions rapidly, they are\nmore likely to cooperate than if they have time to deliberate. Additionally, people who\ncooperate make quicker decisions than those who defect [22]. The Social Heuristics Hy-\npothesis offers one explanation for this phenomena: we adopt heuristics to avoid incurring\ncognitive costs associated with deliberation [23, 24, 25]. In a world with repeated inter-\nactions, it is usually worthwhile to cooperate, so individuals may adopt heuristics such\nas “always cooperate” or “cooperate as long a situation is not a business interaction.”\nThese same individuals, when serving as laboratory subjects, may apply these heuristics\nand cooperate even when it is not worthwhile to do so [22, 26].\n\nOur model offers the following alternative explanation for intuitive cooperation. Intu-\nitive cooperation may serve to reduce responsiveness to realized costs. Thus, others should\ntrust intuitive cooperators more than deliberate cooperators. Since intuitive cooperators\nare more trustworthy, this may lead people to evolve or learn to become intuitive cooper-\nators. Note that this explanation suggests that intuitive cooperation may be an optimal\nresponse to others’ ability to detect deliberation, and not, as a heuristic is, an attempt\nto avoid cognitive costs. For this explanation to be sensible, it must be the case that\nwhether or not a decision is made intuitively or deliberatively is detectable. In fact, it is:\n\ndeliberative decision making leads to slower reaction time, as well as increased pupil size\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026530",
