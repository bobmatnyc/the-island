  "text": "Are Rape Jokes Funny?\n\nAbortion was still illegal in 1970. At the time, as both an\nunderground abortion referral service and a stand-up satirist, | faced an\nundefined paradox. | wouldn’ t allow victims to become the target of my\nhumor, yet there was one particular routine | did that called fora “rape-\nin” of legislators’ wives in order to impregnate them so that they would\nthen convince their husbands to decriminalize abortion..\n\nBut feminist friends objected. | resisted at first, because it was such a\nwell-intentioned joke. And then | reconsidered. Even in a joke, why should\nwomen be assaulted because men made the laws? Legislators’ wives were\nthe victims in that joke, but the legislators themselves were the oppressors,\nand their hypocrisy was really my target. But for me to stop doing that bit\n\nof comedy wasn't chickenshit censorship, it was empathetic editing.\n\nNow, more than four decades later, rape-joking triggered a\nwidespread controversy when a woman who prefers to remain anonymous\nwent to a comedy club, expecting to be entertained. She chose the Laugh\nFactory in Hollywood because Dane Cook was on the bill, but he was\n\nfollowed by Daniel Tosh, and she had never heard of him.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015405",
