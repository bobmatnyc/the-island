  "text": "“So basically, the Iranians are acting like the Israelis — they want peace,\nand they want to keep the land.”\n\nOther analysts, while conceding any progress would be slow, had\nsomewhat more positive forecasts on the Syrian front.\n\n[Syria] is a tough one to happen quickly, but at least if they start talking\nthen it’s a good thing,” said Andrew Hammond, policy fellow at the\nEuropean Council on Foreign Relations and author of The Islamic Utopia:\nThe Illusion of Reform in Saudi Arabia.\n\n“Fundamentally, the chances of the Syrian tragedy being brought to an\nend, or the beginning of this disaster being brought to an end, require these\ntwo countries to come to an agreement [...] They are the keys to the\nSyrian conflict, so they have to start talking, even though it will take a\nlong time.”\n\nAccordingly, with little chance of the two reaching agreement on Syria in\n\nthe immediate future, the talks may in fact focus on other areas of dispute,\nsuch as Iraq, where a new coalition government is being formed following\nparliamentary elections on 30 April.\n\n“The other issue is Iraq, now that the election is over and all the horse-\ntrading is beginning,” said Hammond. “I wonder whether that actually\nmay have been the main impetus for this invitation.”\n\nPerhaps the most significant changes resulting from Faisal’s initiative in\nthe long run, however, will pertain to Saudi itself. Having been “shocked,”\nas Hammond put it, by the United States’ decision to pursue warmer ties\nwith Tehran last year, and initially threatening a “major shift” in its\nrelations with Washington as a consequence, Riyadh may now be\ngrudgingly coming to terms with the new order envisaged by President\nObama.\n\n“It does suggest there is a potential for them to reassess the situation and\ntry and move things forward, find some way of having a new relationship\nwith the Iranians, given the fact that the Americans clearly want to move\nforward, and the smaller Gulf states do as well,” said Hammond.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031574",
