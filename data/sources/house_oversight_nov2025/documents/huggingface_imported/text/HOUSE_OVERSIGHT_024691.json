Epidiolex has not been approved for use in any country, but the drug’s\nmanufacturer, GW Pharmaceuticals, recently submitted a New Drug Application for Epidiolex to the\nFDA, which is an important step toward FDA approval in the United States. If approved by the FDA,\nEpidiolex would be the first FDA-approved prescription drug derived from cannabis. The cannabis\nextract used in Epidiolex is considered to be “marijuana,” a Schedule I controlled substance under the\nCSA. Therefore, even if Epidiolex were approved by the FDA, Epidiolex would need to be rescheduled\nand excepted from the “marijuana” definition before it could be lawfully prescribed in the United\nStates.\n\nConsumer Products Opportunities\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\n\nConsumer Product Brands Focused on Health and Wellness. We believe there is a substantial oppor-\ntunity for companies to develop leading brands of cannabis-based health and wellness products. Mar-\nketing a broad line of such products under a common brand should provide a competitive advantage.\n\nDirect E-Commerce Distribution. The e-commerce market for cannabis products is expected to\nexpand and consumer awareness of product options is expected to increase, enabling more consumer\nproduct companies to sell their products directly to consumers through online purchasing platforms\nrather than selling only through wholesale.\n\nAdvanced Vaporizer Functionality. Vaporizer technology has advanced rapidly in recent years, a\ntrend we expect to continue. In the future, vaporizers may be able to identify the composition and\npotency of the product being consumed, monitor consumption and dosing of the product, or reorder\nthe product at the push of a button.\n\nSpecialty Formulations. We believe that scientific knowledge about the relationships between spe-\ncific cannabinoid formulations and targeted health conditions will continue to improve, and markets\nwill be created for highly specialized products developed to relieve particular symptoms.\n\nFDA Approval and CSA Rescheduling. If Epidiolex is approved by the FDA and rescheduled under\nthe CSA to permit lawful prescriptions to be written within the United States, it would be the first fed-\nerally legal cannabis-derived drug in the country. Such a precedent could result in a significant increase\nin the use of cannabis by consumers as medicine, and it could also be followed by similar approvals in\nthe United States for other cannabis-derived drugs.\n\nConsumer Products Challenges\nChallenges in this segment include:\n\nMarketing and Customer Loyalty. As more products become available to consumers through dis-\npensaries and e-commerce solutions, consumer product providers may need large marketing budgets\nto drive product awareness and customer loyalty.\n\nWholesale and Retail Distribution. Providers of cannabis products may struggle to develop whole-\nsale and retail distribution relationships because of the breadth of products being marketed.
