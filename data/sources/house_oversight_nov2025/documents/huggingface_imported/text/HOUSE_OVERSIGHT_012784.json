  "text": "Testosterone modulates these brain chemicals, suppressing serotonin in the service of heightening\naggression, and ramping up dopamine to add to the already reinforcing properties of testosterone. But\nlike dopamine, testosterone is also directly linked to the reward system. Mice will work a response lever\nto deliver testosterone, and humans become addicted to it. If you inject testosterone into a mouse while it\nis moving about, the location associated with the injection becomes tagged as a favorite spot in the\nlandscape, a place to revisit. Drug abusers and gamblers, two personality profiles associated with\nheightened experience of reward and poor self-control, have elevated levels of testosterone and dopamine.\n\nTwirling inside the brains and bodies of all social animals is a physiological ballet that controls\nthe capacity to harm others. This choreography links harming others with the experience of reward. In\n\nsome animals, the link between harm and reward was upgraded to a capacity for lethal aggression.\n\nHARMING OTHERS, version 1.5: upgrade to lethal aggression\n\nAll social animals have evolved the capacity for aggression, using it to fight members of their own\nspecies for food, land, and sex. For virtually all animals, winning a fight means chasing away or injuring\na competitor, but not killing them. There are, however, three situations in which animals kill, two are\nbroadly distributed across the animal kingdom and one is extremely rare. In virtually every taxonomic\ngroup of animals — insects, reptiles, amphibians, fish, birds, and mammals — there are predators and\nprey. Predators are not merely aggressive, but designed to kill prey species for the purpose of survival.\nAlso common is infanticide, situations in which adults kill infants. Infanticide is often committed by\nmales who have recently entered a group with infants sired by other males. By killing these infants, not\nonly does the newcomer obliterate the competition’s fitness, but he effectively reboots the female’s sexual\nreceptivity. Both predation and infanticide entail significant asymmetries in size or weaponry between\nattacker and victim, making the kill relatively cost-free. Rare in the animal kingdom are cases where\nattacker and victim are from the same species, both adults, and thus, comparable in size and weaponry.\nThis kind of killing — call it adulticide — only occurs in a small number of species, but the attacks are\nsufficiently frequent to count as part of the repertoire: ants, lions, wolves, chimpanzees and humans. The\nrarity of adulticide raises important questions about the evolutionary pressures that favored this upgrade\nto harming others, as well as the mechanisms that evolved to make it possible.\n\nBattles among ant colonies are notorious for their organized attacks, designed to kill the enemy\nand minimize costs. Watching ant colonies battle it out piques the imagination, recalling the classic face\noffs between British and French brigades, each side lined up in strategic formation, divided into ranks, set\nup to protect the land and royalty. In his book Life in the Woods, the American writer and nature lover\n\nHenry David Thoreau, writes that the ant battles were “deadly combat ... without any noise... I never\n\nHauser Chapter 1.
