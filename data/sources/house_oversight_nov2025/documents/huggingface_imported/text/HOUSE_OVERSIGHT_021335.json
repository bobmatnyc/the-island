  "text": "people in pain. Altogether, there is\nstrong evidence to suggest that\nperceiving the pain of others triggers an\nautomatic somatic sensory-motor\nmirroring mechanism between other and\nself, which activates almost the entire\nneural pain matrix including the\nperiaqueductal gray, a major site in pain\ntransmission and for processing of fear\nand anxiety, and the supplementary\nmotor area that programs defensive\nmovements in response to anticipated\npain. Such a neural resonance\nmechanism provides a functional bridge\nbetween first-person and third-person\ninformation. It is grounded in the\nequivalence of self and other, which\nallows for analogical reasoning, and\noffers a possible, yet partial, route to\nunderstanding others.\n\nOf course, human empathic\nabilities are more sophisticated than\nsimply yoking perceptions of the self\nand other. In the eighteenth century,\nScottish philosopher and economist\nAdam Smith proposed that through\nimagination, “we place ourselves in his\nsituation... enter as it were into his body,\nand become in some measure the same\nperson with” (8). By means of\nimagination we come to experience\nsensations which are generally similar\nto, although typically weaker than, those\nof the other person. This capacity to\nengage in role-taking has been\ntheoretically linked to the development\nof empathy, moral reasoning, and more\ngenerally, prosocial behavior. Unlike the\nmotor mimicry and emotional contagion\naspect of empathy, perspective-taking\ndevelops later, possibly because it draws\nheavily on the maturation of executive\nfunctions (1.e., processes that serve to\nmonitor and control thought and actions,\nincluding self-regulation, planning,\ncognitive flexibility, response inhibition,\n\nPage | 89\n\nand resistance to interference), functions\nthat are predominantly centered in the\nprefrontal cortex which continues to\nmature from birth to adolescence.\nTheoretically, imagining the other is\ndistinct from imagining the self: the\nformer may evoke empathic concern\n(defined as an other-oriented response\ncongruent with the perceived distress of\nthe person in need) while the latter\ninduces both empathic concern and\npersonal distress (1.e., a self-oriented\naversive emotional response such as\nanxiety or discomfort). This distinction\nhas been supported empirically. When\nindividuals are asked to imagine how\nthey would feel in reaction to emotion-\nladen familiar situations and to imagine\nhow a known person would feel if she\nwas experiencing the same situations,\ncommon neural circuits are activated\nboth for the self and the other. However,\nrelative to imagining the self, imagining\nthe other results in specific activation of\nparts of the frontal cortex that are\nimplicated in executive control—the use\nof attention and working memory and\ndecisions—and an area of the brain at\nthe interface of the temporal and parietal\nlobes of the brain that is a key\ncomponent of a larger network of neural\ncircuits involved in attention (sometimes\ncalled the temporoparietal junction).\n\nSome researchers have\nhypothesized that the role of the frontal\nlobes and the temporoparietal junction is\nto hold separate perspectives or to resist\ninterference against attention to one’s\nown perspective. In a recent functional\nbrain imaging study (9), participants\nwere shown pictures of people with their\nhands or feet in painful or non-painful\nsituations with the instruction to imagine\nthemselves or to imagine another\nindividual experiencing these situations.\nDuring perception of painful situations,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021335",
