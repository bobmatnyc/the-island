Hence it is likely that\nthe story that Snowden had thoroughly destroyed all the stolen\ndata in the month prior to departing for Russia, as well as the story\nthat he had turned down all requests to be questioned by the FSB\nand other Russian intelligence officials, was part of the legend con-\nstructed for him. The repetitions of these uncorroborated claims in\nhis press interviews might also have enhanced his public image for\nthe ACLU effort to get clemency for him. Even so, in view of the\nimportance of such communications intelligence to Russia, it would\nbe the height of naiveté for U.S. or British intelligence to accept such\nclaims as anything more than camouflage.\n\nAs for Snowden’s motive, I see no reason to doubt his explana-\ntion that he stole NSA documents to expose its surveillance because\nhe believed that it was an illicit intrusion into the privacy of indi-\nviduals. Such disaffection is not a unique situation in the intelligence\nbusiness.

It will be recalled\nthat the deepest part of his penetration was during the five weeks\nhe worked at the National Threat Operations Center in Hawaii as\na contract employee of Booz Allen Hamilton. It was there that he\ncopied Level 3 files, including the so-called road map to the gaps\nin American intelligence.
