  "text": "existence, and there was an overwhelming temptation to remain in that\nblissful limbo. Yet there was also something in me that kept saying\n“Don’ t give up!\" It was my survival instinct speaking.\n\nBut why not give up? What was there left for me? The answer came\nto me by the same extraterrestrial path it had come to Ike: 7e// the truth!\nThat was the turning point of my life. And these memoirs are the tangible\nresult of my transformation. No one shall be spared, least of all myself.\n\nThose hairless creatures told me that President John F. Kennedy had\nalso been visited by their kind. His father, old Joe Kennedy, had gotten rich\noff illegal booze during Prohibition, and you can be certain that the\nunderworld bootleggers he was tied up with were not about to dissolve\ntheir silent partnership in this huge liquor industry they had built up,\nsimply because Prohibition had been repealed. Yet there was Joe\nKennedy’ s own son, Jack—not to mention his brother Bobby—refusing\nto cooperate any longer in allowing organized crime to have a comeback\nin Cuba, and furthermore, going after organized crime in th/s country. At\nbest this was ingratitude; at worst it was treason.\n\nBut | finally understood the extraterrestrial force that had motivated\nyoung Kennedy. And so now | am ready to peel away the final layers of my\n\npoker-face mask.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015093",
