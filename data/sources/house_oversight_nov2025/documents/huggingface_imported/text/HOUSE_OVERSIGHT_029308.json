Although much press was\ngiven to “marriage penalty relief” when\nthe Bush-era tax cuts were permanently\nextended by the American Taxpayer Relief\nAct of 2012 (ATRA), such relief in fact\nonly related to equality within the stan-\ndard deduction amount and the top por-\ntion of the 15 percent income tax bracket.\nOther “marriage penalties” continue to\nexist within the tax law depending upon\ncircumstances, For example, the 33 per-\ncent tax bracket for joint filers in 2013\nstarts at $223,050 taxable income, while\nthe 33 percent bracket for single taxpayers\nstarts at $183,250. If there were no mar-\nriage penalty imposed on higher-income\nindividuals earning similar amounts, the\n33 percent bracket for joint filers would\nnot start until reaching the $366,500\nlevel, or double that set under the Internal\nRevenue Code for single filers.\nMarried Filing Separately. \\f same-sex\nmarried couples post-Windsor want to keep\ntheir finances (and liabilities) separate for the\npurpose of filing separate returns, they will\ngenerally—but not always—pay more federal\nincome tax. The rate brackets for “married\nfiling separately” are higher than “unmarried,\nnot surviving spouse or head of household.”\n\nInnocent Spouse Status. Married taxpayers\nwho file joint returns are jointly and severally\nresponsible for the tax and any interest or pen-\nalty due on the joint return. In some cases, a\nspouse will be relieved of this shared liability for\ntax owed on a joint tax return. Three types of\nrelief are available: general innocent spouse re-\n\nlief; separate liability relief; and equitable relief.\n\nIMPACT. Because of the Supreme\nCourts decision, the three types of in-\nnocent spouse relief are now presumably\navailable to same-sex married couples.\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nSame-sex married partners cannot turn\na blind eye to any item that is listed on\na joint return. A decision to file joint\nreturns retroactively for prior tax years\nas the result of the Supreme Court’ de-\ncision, therefore, should include consid-\neration of the joint and several liability\nthat would be triggered. Separate return\nstatus would eliminate the issue of joint\nliability entirely. The IRS is expected to\n\nissue guidance in this area.\n\nSurviving Spouse Claims. A surviving\nspouse computes tax using the same rate\nbrackets as married couples filing joint re-\nturns. Rules for surviving spouse status for\nsame-sex married couples now presumably\nfollow the same rules as for opposite-sex\ncouples. If a taxpayer is a surviving spouse,\nthe year the spouse died is the last year for\nwhich the taxpayer can file a joint return\nwith that spouse. A taxpayer can also qual-\nify as surviving spouse for two tax years fol-\nlowing the year in which his or her spouse\ndies if the taxpayer maintains a household\nfor certain dependents (a child, adopted\nchild, foster child, or stepchild), has not\nremarried, and filed or could have filed a\njoint return with the spouse for the year in\n\nwhich his or her spouse died.\n\nFILING STATUS, AGI FLOORS\nAND THRESHOLD AMOUNTS\n\nThe amounts of income and deductions\nreported on a return are used by the IRS\nin determining whether certain thresh-\nold levels and floors are reached. Those\namounts in turn determine access to a va-\nriety of tax benefits. Some of these floors\nor threshold amounts are applied to all\nfiling statuses uniformly; others vary de-\npending upon filing status.\n\nIMPACT. Depending upon adjusted gross\nincome (AGI) and other levels reported\non a return, combining the income and\ndeductions of each same-sex partner un-\nder a single joint return may or may not\nwork to the advantage of the couple as a\nunit, in contrast to filing as unmarried or\n\nmarried filing separately.\n\nFloors. Tax benefits dependent upon floor\nlevels of adjusted gross income (AGI) or\nmodified AGI (MAGI) set forth under the\nInternal Revenue Code include the following\nitemized deduction categories, among others:\n\nm Medical expense deduction floor (10\npercent AGI (temporarily at 7.5 percent\nfor taxpayers over age 65));\n\nm Casualty loss deduction floor (10 per-\ncent AGI); and\n\nm Miscellaneous items deduction floor (2\n\npercent AGI).\n\nCOMMENT. J» the case of married in-\ndividuals who file separate returns, if one\nspouse itemizes deductions on his or her\nreturn, the other spouse must also do so ir-\nrespective of whether his or her standard\ndeduction would be larger. This rule does\nnot apply to unmarried couples who file\n\nseparate returns.\n\nCeilings. Use of excess capital losses to off-\nset ordinary income is generally limited to\n$3,000 per return, whether on a joint return\nor an unmarried single return. Taxpayers\nwho are married filing separately, however,\nare allowed only a $1,500 maximum capital\nloss deduction; the balance in all cases may\nbe carried forward into the next tax year.\n\nThresholds. For some taxpayers, AGI] above\ndesignated thresholds reduces certain tax\nbenefits. A reduction in itemized deduc-\ntions and a reduction in personal exemp-\ntions are the most common among higher-\nincome individuals. For example:\n\nus ltemized deductions otherwise allowed must\nbe reduced by the lesser of (1) three percent of\nAGI that exceeded a threshold amount (see\nchart, below) adjusted annually for inflation,\nor (2) 80 percent of the total amount of oth-\nerwise allowable itemized deductions. No re-\nduction is required in the case of deductions\nfor medical expenses, investment interest,\nand casualty, theft or wagering losses.\n\na Personal exemptions, likewise, are required\nto be reduced where AGI exceeds a specified\nthreshold amount: by two percent for each\n$2,500 (or fraction thereof) by which AGI\n\n©2013 CCH Incorporated.
