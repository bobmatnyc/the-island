  "text": "Family and acquaintances, including a former Fort Worth police lieutenant,\nsubmitted letters to the court vouching for McDaniel’s character.\n\nThere were other issues, however, presented to the judge. While McDaniel was\nbeing held in federal lockup awaiting sentencing, he had corresponded with his\nvictim, despite being ordered not to contact her, the court record shows.\n\nStill, Hunt argued that a sentence of five years was overly harsh.\n\nVillafafia disagreed, but conceded that McDaniel would benefit from psychological\ntreatment. She advocated for a sentence of five to sex years, which was at the low\nend of the guideline.\n\nIt was then that the judge heard from the victim’s mother.\n\nIn a statement, the mother decried the emotional and mental trauma her daughter\nsuffered and the long road to recovery she had ahead of her. The mother mentioned\nshe was further upset that McDaniel continued contact with her daughter after his\narrest and she said she believed that McDaniel was still trying to manipulate her\ndaughter by blaming her for his arrest.\n\nThe mother pointed out that prior to their sexual encounter, McDaniel had directed\nher daughter to watch sexually explicit movies and had described for her sex\nactivities he had had with another underage girl.\n\nAt that point, the judge interrupted.\n\n“here has been some reference to another incident with a minor girl. What do\nyou know about that, if anything?” Zloch asked Villafana.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021735",
