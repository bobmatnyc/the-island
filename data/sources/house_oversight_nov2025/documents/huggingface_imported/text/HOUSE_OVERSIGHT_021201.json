The sunlight shown through the glass ceilings\ninto where we were standing, making the moment feel even more surreal\non top of the already popped Xanax I had popped before for breakfast\nearlier that morning. Jeffrey was in such a lighthearted mood that day,\nmaking funny cracks at me, and acting like a flirt. When I was finished\nwashing him he actually wanted to wash me too, which was another\ntotally out of his character suggestion.\n\nFor the rest of the day, he took me everywhere with him, the office and\nthen to a friends place, even just wanting to hang out with me for a while.\n1 wasn’t used to being treated like anything more than a dog on a leash,\nwhen he acted like this it just completely spun me around confusing me\neven more.\n\nWe were spending heaps of time together these days, a lot more than\nusual. At the ranch we would do things together, alone, and not just the\nusual! perverted things ] was accustomed to doing with him alone.\nHorseback riding on his ranch during weekends away by ourselves and\nmovie nights snuggling up over a bucket of popcorn instead of having to\nmassage his feet during the entire film became his way to alter my\nperception of my original notion that | wasn’t just his sex slave, I thought\nI was finally becoming his friend.\n\nWhen we went quad biking he no longer wanted me to take my own\nbike, he preferred me to sit on the back of his, holding onto him tightly\nand he even tried to teach me how to drive a manual stick shift car. He\nwas definitely trying to show a softer side of himself, different to the\nstone cold slave driver | had to come to respect out of fear over the many\nyears. Still a hard image to change after all | had been through and seen\nover the years I had been with him. Nonetheless he was still my “boss” so\nI humored his attempts and matched his caring demeanor, giving him the\nimpression I was intrigued in our new kind of affair.\n\nChapter 19\n\nHis attentiveness led into the warmer months that commenced the\nbeginning of long summer days that | looked forward too. I couldn’t help\nbut enjoy his eagerness to see me more relaxed these days. He wasn’t\neven bothering me to find alternate sources of girls for his twisted\nsatisfaction anymore and although I was still being used for his distorted\nsexual enjoyments he further seduced me into believing I meant a lot\nmore to him than | ever did.\n\n113\n\ni: Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004246\n\nIt all came to a sudden conclusion one sunny afternoon in the Caribbean.\nJeffrey pulled himself up to the ladders first step and climbed up the next\nfour steps to the top of the dock. His chest was heaving rapidly as he sat\ndown catching his breath. Ghislane was the next one up and then I\nfollowed lastly behind them. To me it was an invigorating snorkel around\nthe shallow reefs within the radius of the dock, but to Jeffrey the half an\nhour swim in the ocean was enough to overexert his ageing limbs. I took\noff my snorkel gear and placed it in the storage bench, grabbing us a few\ntowels at the same time. Wrapping a towel around Jeffrey’s backside and\nhanding one to Ghislane, ] sat down next to them on the dock and we\nlaughed how fatigued Jeffrey was, poking fun that he really is getting\nolder. A very touchy subject for the vain at heart but he didn’t seem to\nmind it, probably knowing we'd never take the joke too far. We sat there\nin silence for a moment, an odd silence at that. Jeffrey looked at Ghislane\nand then Ghislane looked at me, placing me once again in the spotlight.\nThey both scooted closer to where I was sitting and I felt something\nstirring in the air. The biggest turning point of events in all of my time\nspent with them.\n\nJeffrey sat next to me and put his hand on my back and looked at me\nwith a certain kind of sincerity I hadn’t seen in him before. “I want to\nfirst of all tell you that over the last few years you have shown me the\nkind of devotion and loyalty that I believe is rare to find among people\nthese days, qualities I hold that high in regard.” Bewildered by the whole\nscenario I just nodded every time he paused, trying to grasp what his\nintentions were getting at. He continued to praise my nature saying “I\nhope you know my appreciation for your embracing of my lifestyle, you\nhave been achieving a name for yourself among the friends I have\nintroduced you to. Everybody says basically the same thing about you,\nthe same thing J believe. You are a delightfully funny girl who has\ndeveloped into a mature graceful young woman and | could think of\nnobody else I’d rather have a child than with than you.”\n\nAnd just like that he created a whole new dilemma for me to face. In\nutter shock from the completely unexpected proposition and before |\ncould even think of anything to respond with, Ghislane made the\nfinishing touches with the business end of the deal starting with the pros\nbefore the cons “You would have around the clock nannies to help you.\nJeffrey would pay for a mansion of your choice in either Palm Beach or\nNew York” and as if the drumrolls were beckoning “ and... you would\nhave a hefty monthly allowance from Jeffrey’s bank account” Astonished\nat their first offers I nearly took the bait. Then she continued to finish the\nterms of our pre-agreement with “But you would have to travel with the\nchild where and when Jeffrey wanted you to be, and most importantly\nyou would have to sign a contract stating that Jeffrey and you are not\n\n114\n\nB Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFPRE004247\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021201",
