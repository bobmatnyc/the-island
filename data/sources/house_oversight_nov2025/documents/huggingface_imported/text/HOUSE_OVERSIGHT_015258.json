And exactly where the truth is in all that or\nwhether it’ s a shade of grey and both are true, there’ s a lot more\ninformation that is needed.\n\n“Going back in African history, this reptilian group actually go back\na phenomenal amount of time in relation to this planet, and they claim\nthat it’ s actually rightfully theirs, and at some point in the ancient past\nthere were some great wars that went on, and in fact they were kicked off,\nand they’ re trying to regain control of what they think is rightfully theirs,\nlike being kicked out of a country.\n\n“Other researchers, concentrating on the reptilian thing for a long\ntime, say that in some way they basically go around to different places, just\nraping the resources, and then move on. Then there’ s the one about the\nfact that in some way a lot of these beings were almost imprisoned, in a\nvibrational prison, like they can’ t get out of it by going up because they\ncan’ t vibrationally get there in their present state of being. And their only\n\nway out of that level is to come into a lower level of vibration into this\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015258",
