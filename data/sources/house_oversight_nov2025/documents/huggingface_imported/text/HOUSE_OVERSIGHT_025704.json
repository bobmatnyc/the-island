In that\ncommunication, we urgently requested that your Office conduct an independent review of the\nproposed federal prosecution of our client, Jeffrey Epstein. The dual reasons for our request that\nyou review this matter are (i) the bedrock need for integrity in the enforcement of federal\ncriminal laws, and (ii) the profound questions raised by the unprecedented extension of federal\nlaw by the United States Attorney’s Office in Miami (the “USAO”) to a prominent public figure\nwho has close ties to former President Clinton.\n\nThe need for review is now all the more exigent. On Monday, May 19, 2008, First\nAssistant Jeffrey Sloman of the USAO responded to an email from Jay Lefkowitz informing U.S.\nAttorney Alex Acosta that we would be seeking your Office’s review. Mr. Sloman’s letter,\nwhich imposed a deadline of June 2, 2008 to comply with all the terms of the current Non-\nProsecution Agreement (the “Agreement”), plus new unilateral modifications, on pain of being\ndeemed in breach of that Agreement, appears to have been deliberately designed to deprive us of\nan adequate opportunity to seek your Office’s review in this matter.\n\nThe USAO’s desire to foreclose a complete review is understandable, given that the\nChild Exploitation and Obscenity Section (“CEOS”) has already determined that our substantive\narguments regarding why a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein is not warranted were\n“compelling.” However, in contradiction to Mr. Sloman’s assertion that CEOS had provided an\nindependent, de novo review, CEOS made clear that it did not do so. Indeed, CEOS declined to\nexamine several of the more troubling aspects of the investigation of Mr. Epstein, including the\ndeliberate leak to the New York Times of numerous highly confidential aspects of the\ninvestigation and negotiations between the parties as well as the recent crop of civil lawsuits\nfiled against Mr. Epstein by Mr. Sloman’s former law partner.\n\nThe unnecessary and arbitrarily imposed deadline set by the USAO was done without any\n\nrespect for the normal functioning and scheduling of state judicial matters. It requires that\nMr. Epstein’s counsel persuade the State Attorney of Palm Beach to issue a criminal information\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025704",
