  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54011\n\nability to protect and enforce those\nrights, this rule is ‘‘necessary”’ for\npurposes of Section 6.\n\nAside from the rule’s manifest\nnecessity, the notice posting\nrequirement fills a Chevron-type gap in\nthe NLRA’s statutory scheme. Thus, as\ndiscussed, the purpose of Section 1, as\nimplemented in Sections 7 and 8, is to\nencourage the free exercise and\nenforcement of the Act’s provisions, and\nfulfillment of that purpose depends on\nthe private initiative of employees and\nemployers to commence Board\nrepresentation proceedings pursuant to\nSection 9 and Board unfair labor\npractice proceedings pursuant to\nSection 10. The effective working of the\nNLRA’s administrative machinery\ntherefore presupposes that workers and\ntheir employers have knowledge of the\nrights afforded by the statute and the\nmeans for their timely enforcement. The\nstatute, however, has no provision with\nrespect to making that knowledge\navailable, a subject about which the\nstatute is completely silent.\n\nThis statutory gap has always been\npresent but was of less significance in\nearlier years when the density of union\norganization was greater, since, as is\nwidely recognized, unions have been a\ntraditional source of information about\nthe NLRA’s provisions. See Lechmere,\nInc. v. NLRB, 502 U.S. 527, 531-32\n(1992) (reaffirming that the Section 7\nrights of employees interested in union\norganization depend to some extent on\ntheir having access to unions); Harlan\nFuel Co., 8 N.L.R.B. 25, 32 (1938)\n(holding that the rights guaranteed to\nemployees by Section 7 include “full\nfreedom to receive aid, advice and\ninformation from others concerning\n[their self-organization] rights’’); cf.\nChamber of Commerce of the United\nStates v. Brown, 554 U.S. 60, 68 (2008)\n(observing that Section 7 “implies an\nunderlying right to receive\ninformation’’). Moreover, as rates of\nunionization have declined, employees\nare less likely to have experience with\ncollective bargaining or to be in contact\nwith other employees who have had\nsuch experience. The statutory gap is\nthus now important to the Board’s\nadministration of the NLRA and its role\nin enforcing employees’ rights.\n\nAs the Supreme Court has observed,\n\nThe responsibility to adapt the Act to\nchanging patterns of industrial life is\nentrusted to the Board. * * * It is the\nprovince of the Board, not the courts, to\ndetermine whether or not the “need” [for a\nBoard rule] exists in light of changing\nindustrial practices and the Board’s\ncumulative experience in dealing with labor-\nmanagement relations. For the Board has the\n“special function of applying the general\n\nprovisions of the Act to the complexities of\nindustrial life,” and its special competence in\nthis field is the justification for the deference\naccorded its determination.\n\nNLRB v. J. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S.\n251, 266 (1975) (citations omitted).\nConsistent with this understanding of\nthe Board’s role, the notice-posting\nregulations represent an attempt to\n“adapt the Act’’ in light of recent\nrealities and “the Board’s cumulative\nexperience.” Id. The rule is wholly\nconsistent with the aims of the NLRA,\nand the “need” for it now is heightened\ngiven the “changing patterns of\nindustrial life.” Id.\n\nFor all these reasons, this rule is\nentitled to deference regardless of how\nit is characterized because it is\n“reasonably related to the purposes of\nthe enabling legislation,” Thorpe, 393\nU.S. at 280-81, and constitutes a\n“reasonable interpretation’ of the\nenacted text,’ Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 714\n(quoting Chevron, 467 U.S. at 844).\n\nIn response to the NPRM, a number of\narguments have been made challenging\nthe Board’s statutory authority to\npromulgate the notice posting rule. As\nexplained below, the Board does not\nfind merit in any of these arguments.\n\n1. Limitations on the Board’s\nRulemaking Authority Implied by\nSections 9 and 10 of the Act\n\nOf the comments that address the\nBoard’s statutory authority to issue this\nrule, many express agreement with the\ndissenting views of Member Hayes that\nwere published in the NPRM. Member\nHayes criticized the basis for the rule\nand questioned the Board’s statutory\nauthority to promulgate and enforce it.\nSee 75 FR 80415. He specifically\nreferred to Section 10 as an obstacle to\nthe proposed rule, because it\n““ndicate[d] to [him] that the Board\nclearly lacks the authority to order\naffirmative notice-posting action in the\nabsence of an unfair labor practice\ncharge filed by an outside party.” Id.\n\nMany comments submitted in\nresponse to the NPRM, such as those of\nthe Texas Association for Home Care &\nHospice and those of the Independent\nBakers Association, interpret Section 10\nto prohibit the Board from ordering any\naffirmative act that does not address the\nconsequences of an unfair labor\npractice. Although this proposition may\nbe true when the Board acts through\nadjudication—the administrative\nfunction to which Section 10 directly\napplies—it does not perforce apply\nwhen the Board specifies affirmative\nrequirements via rulemaking under\nSection 6. See Clifton v. FEC, 114 F.3d\n1309, 1312 (1st Cir. 1997) (“Agencies\nare often allowed through rulemaking to\n\nregulate beyond the express substantive\ndirectives of the statute, so long as the\nstatute is not contradicted.’’) (citing\nMourning). If it did, then the Board’s\nlongstanding rule mandating that\nemployers post an election notice three\ndays before a representation election\nwould be subject to challenge on that\nground. See 29 CFR 103.20; see also\nPannier Corp., Graphics Div. v. NLBB,\n120 F.3d 603, 606-07 (6th Cir. 1997)\n(rejecting an as-applied challenge to\n\n§ 103.20). Furthermore, under American\nHospital Association, the Board's\nexercise of its broad rulemaking\nauthority under Section 6 is presumed\nto be authorized unless elsewhere in the\nAct there is “language expressly\ndescribing an exception from that\nsection or at least referring specifically\nto the section.”’ 499 U.S. at 613. Section\n10 does not refer to the Board’s Section\n6 authority.\n\nSome comments, such as those of the\nCouncil on Labor Law Equality\n(COLLE), contend that the Board has no\nauthority whatsoever to administer the\nNLRA unless a representation petition\nor unfair labor practice charge has been\nfiled under Sections 9 or 10,\nrespectively. The Board declines to\nadopt such a narrow view of its own\nauthority. Certainly, the Board cannot\nissue certifications or unfair labor\npractice orders via rulemaking\nproceedings. But that is not what this\ntule does. As explained above, by\npromulgating the notice-posting rule,\nthe Board is taking a modest step that\nis ‘necessary to carry out the\nprovisions”’ of the Act, 29 U.S.C. 156,\nand that also fills a statutory gap left by\nCongress in the NLRA.\n\nMoreover, the argument advanced by\nCOLLE and others fails to appreciate\nthat the Board’s authority to administer\nthe Act is not strictly limited to those\nmeans specifically set forth in the\nNLRA. Rather, as the Supreme Court has\nrecognized, the NLRA impliedly\nauthorizes the Board to take appropriate\nmeasures “to prevent frustration of the\npurposes of the Act.’’ NLRB v. Nash-\nFinch Co., 404 U.S. 138, 142 (1971). By\nway of example, the Supreme Court\npointed out that its decisions had\nrecognized the Board’s implied\nauthority to petition for writs of\nprohibition against premature\ninvocation of the review jurisdiction of\nthe courts of appeals, see In re NLRB,\n304 U.S. 486, 496 (1938); to institute\ncontempt proceedings for violation of\nenforced Board orders, see\nAmalgamated Util. Workers v. Con.\nEdison Co., 309 U.S. 261 (1940); and to\nfile claims in bankruptcy for Board-\nawarded backpay, see Nathanson v.\nNLRB, 344 U.S. 25 (1952). Relying on\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022282",
