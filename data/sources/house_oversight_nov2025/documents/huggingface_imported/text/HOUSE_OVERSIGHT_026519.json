The realized gain\nincreased by the $28 k option premium that resulted from the\nbarrier level trading in USD JPY. The USD sold off vs the AUD,\nGBP and the NZD today. The USD rallied against the CAD and the\nJPY.\n\nI have separated y t d p/! from Sept p/1 so that the numbers mean\nmore.\n\nHopefully the AUD will stay above .88 going into next Monday. As\nI write this it is approx .90, which is good. I know it's not BRL, but\nI think that we are realizing some good gains. In the weeks ahead\nvolatility will likely increase as Congress considers standing behind\nObama and attacking Syria. Liquidity in restricted currencies can\ndisappear at the trader's will. I prefer that we trade liquid easily\ncurrencies at a time like this.\n\nLaurie\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026519",
