  "text": "Jealousy At the Swingers Convention\n\nThe 24th annual Lifestyles Couples Convention has filled three hotels\n\nin Palm Springs, California. The Convention Center is connected to one of\nthem, the Wyndham, which surrounds a large outdoor pool and patio\npopulated by couples busy socializing in 116-degree dry heat. Women and\nmen alike are wearing thongs. From afar they appear like so many eyeless\nsmiley faces among the bathing suits. The law that Sonny Bono signed\nwhen he was mayor, banning thongs in public, does not apply to this\nevent, or, for that matter, to Cher.\n\nThe convention is for couples only. Except for me. I’ ve been hired\nto perform stand-up comedy at their Friday luncheon, and |’ m here\nalone. On the small, propellor plane from Los Angeles to Palm Springs, the\nright side consists of two-seat rows, occupied entirely by couples on their\nway to the convention—horny with the expectation of getting laid by the\nspouse of a stranger, perhaps sitting in front of or behind them—and the\nleft side of the plane consists of one-seat rows, occupied entirely by me.\n\nI' m afraid that the plane might tip over upon trying to land.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015192",
