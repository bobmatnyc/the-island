  "text": "becomes an event that can force a regional crisis in the midst of\nongoing regional crises. It thus is a vote that could have significant\nconsequences.\n\nThe Palestinian Divide\n\nLet's begin with the issue not of the right of a nation to have a state\nbut of the nature of a Palestinian state under current circumstances.\nThe Palestinians are split into two major factions. The first, Fatah,\ndominates the West Bank. Fatah derives its ideology from the older,\nsecular Pan-Arab movement. Historically, Fatah saw the Palestinians\nas a State within the Arab nation. The second, Hamas, dominates\nGaza. Unlike Fatah, it sees the Palestinians as forming part of a\nbroader Islamist uprising, one in which Hamas is the dominant\nIslamist force of the Palestinian people.\n\nThe Pan-Arab rising is moribund. Where it once threatened the\nexistence of Muslim states, like the Arab monarchies, it is now itself\nthreatened. Mubarak, Syrian President Bashar al Assad and Libyan\nleader Moammar Gadhafi all represented the old Pan-Arab vision. A\nmuch better way to understand the \"Arab Spring\" is that it\nrepresented the decay of such regimes that were vibrant when they\ncame to power in the late 1960s and early 1970s but have fallen into\nideological meaninglessness. Fatah is part of this grouping, and while\nit still speaks for Palestinian nationalism as a secular movement,\nbeyond that it is isolated from broader trends in the region. It is both\nat odds with rising religiosity and simultaneously mistrusted by the\nmonarchies it tried to overthrow. Yet it controls the Palestinian proto-\nstate, the Palestinian National Authority, and thus will be claiming a\nU.N. vote on Palestinian statehood. Hamas, on the other hand, is very\nmuch representative of current trends in the Islamic world and holds\nsignificant popular support, yet it is not clear that it holds a majority\nposition in the Palestinian nation.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031918",
