LEFKOWITZ, Eso.\nDECEMBER 13, 2007\nPAGE 3 OF 5\n\nalready been submitted to the Office on several occasions and you suggest that I have kept that\ninformation from those who reviewed the proposed indictment package. Contrary to your\nsuggestion, those submissions were attached to and incorporated in the proposed indictment\npackage, so your suggestion that I tried to hide something from the reviewers is false. I also take\nissue with the duplicity of stating that we must accept as true those parts of the Recarey reports and\nwitness statements that you like and we must accept as false those parts that you do not like. You\nand your co-counsel also impressed upon me from the beginning the need to undertake an\nindependent investigation. It seems inappropriate now to complain because our independent\ninvestigation uncovered facts that are unfavorable to your client.\n\nYou complain that I “forced” your client and the State Attorney's Office to proceed on\ncharges that they do not believe in, yet you do not want our Office to inform the State Attorney’ s\nOffice of facts that support the additional charge nor do you want any of the victims of that charge\nto contact Ms. Belohlavek or the Court. Ms. Belohlavek’s opinion may change if she knows the full\nscope of your client’s actions. You and I spent several weeks trying to identify and put together a\nplea to federal charges that your client was willing to accept. Yet your letter now accuses me of\n“manufacturing” charges of obstruction of justice, making obscene phone calls, and violating child\nprivacy laws. When Mr. Lourie told you that those charges would “embarrass the Office,” he meant\nthat the Office was unwilling to bend the facts to satisfy Mr. Epstein’s desired prison sentence — a\nstatement with which I agree.\n\nI hope that you understand how your accusations that I imposed “ultimatums” and “forced”\nyou and your client to agree to unconscionable contract terms cannot square with the true facts of\nthis case. As explained in letters from Messrs. Acosta and Sloman, the indictment was postponed\nfor more than five months to allow you and Mr. Epstein’s other attorneys to make presentations to\nthe Office to convince the Office not to prosecute. Those presentations were unsuccessful. As you\nmention in your letter, I -a simple line AUSA ~ handled the primary negotiations for the Office, and\nconducted those negotiations with you, Ms. Sanchez, Mr. Lewis, and a host of other highly skilled\nand experienced practitioners. As you put it, your group has a “combined 250 years experience” to\nmy fourteen. The agreement itself was signed by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Sanchez, and Mr. Lefcourt,\nwhose experience speaks for itself. You and I spent hours negotiating the terms, including when to\nuse “a” versus “the” and other minutiae. When you and I could not reach agreement, you repeatedly\nwent over my head, involving Messrs. Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta in the negotiations at\nvarious times. In any and all plea negotiations the defendant understands that his options are to\nplead or to continue with the investigation and proceed to trial. Those were the same options that\nwere proposed to Mr. Epstein, and they are not “persecution or intimidation tactics.”. Mr. Epstein\nchose to sign the agreement with the advice of a multitude of extremely noteworthy counsel.\n\nYou also make much of the fact that the names of the victims were not released to Mr.\nEpstein prior to signing the Agreement. You never asked for such a term. During an earlier\nmeeting, where Mr. Black was present, he raised the concern that you now voice. Mr. Black and\nI did not have a chance to discuss the issue, but I had already conceived of a way to resolve that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012579",
