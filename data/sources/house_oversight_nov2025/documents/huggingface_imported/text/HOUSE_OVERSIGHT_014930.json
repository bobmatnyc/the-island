Total minutes for 1Q17\n\n(2-mo. data) are tracking down 18% y/y, with mobile down 18% and desktop down 23%.\nMobile minutes have averaged a 20% y/y decline for the last 4 months.\n\nEstimates vs Consensus\n\nOur 1Q17 rev/EPS estimates for $535mn/S0.03 are slightly above the Street and above\nthe implied midpoint of management’s guidance (based on EBITDA and EBITDA margin\noutlook}. Despite our near-term concerns, we believe the outlook was sufficiently\nconservative. That said, we see risk to current consensus estimates for the year, and we\nare below Street revenue at $2.3bn for 2017 vs consensus at $2.35bn, though slightly\nahead on EBITDA on more moderate cost assumptions. Our 2017 estimates assume a\nconservative 4% MAU growth for the year.\n\nTable 29: Twitter Estimate Summary\n\n1Q17 2017 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofA ML est. $535 $544 $2,301 $2,339\nGrowth Y/Y% -10% -10% -9% 2%\nStreet $510 $548 $2,352 $2,496\nBofA ML vs Street Above Below Below Below\nEBITDA\nBofA ML est. $120 $152 $639 $689\nStreet $94 $135 $564 $650\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\nEPS\nBofA ML est. $0.03 $0.08 $0.33 $0.34\nStreet $0.01 $0.06 $0.27 $0.37\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Below\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\n\nOur $14.50 price objective is based on 12x our 2018 EBITDA estimate, which reflects a\ndiscount to the online media group (13x). We believe the Twitter platform has slowing\nuser and revenue growth and as such, we expect the stock to trade at a sustained\ndiscount to online media peers, with potential M&A adding some offsetting downside\nsupport.\n\n44 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 Bankof America <2\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014930",
