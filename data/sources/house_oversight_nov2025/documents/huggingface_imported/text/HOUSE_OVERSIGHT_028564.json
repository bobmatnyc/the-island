United\nStates, 440 U.S. 668, 669 (1979) (quoting United States v.\nUnion Pacific R. Co., 91 U.S. 72, 79 1875)). In this case,\nhistorical context, purpose, and related consequences tell\nus a great deal about the proper interpretation of the\nImmunities Act.\n\nCongressional reports explain that Congress, acting in\nthe immediate aftermath of World War II, intended the\nImmunities Act to serve two related purposes. First, it\nwould “enabl[e] this country to fulfill its commitments in\nconnection with its membership in international organiza-\ntions.” S. Rep.

See id., at 2.\n\nThe founding agreements for several of these organiza-\ntions required member states to grant them broad immun-\nity from suit. The Bretton Woods Agreements, for exam-\nple, provided that the IMF “shall enjoy immunity from\nevery form of judicial process except to the extent that. it\nexpressly waives its immunity.” Articles of Agreement of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028564",
