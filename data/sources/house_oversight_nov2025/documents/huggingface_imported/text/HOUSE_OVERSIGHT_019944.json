  "text": "him over the portrayal.) Ivanka, speaking with something like a Valley Girl accent—which\nwould transform in the years ahead into something like a Disney princess voice—seems\nno more ambitious or even employed than anyone else, but she is notably less angry with\nher parents.\n\nShe treated her father with some lightness, even irony, and in at least one television\ninterview she made fun of his comb-over. She often described the mechanics behind it to\nfriends: an absolutely clean pate—a contained island after scalp reduction surgery—\nsurrounded by a furry circle of hair around the sides and front, from which all ends are\ndrawn up to meet in the center and then swept back and secured by a stiffening spray. The\ncolor, she would point out to comical effect, was from a product called Just for Men—the\nlonger it was left on, the darker it got. Impatience resulted in Trump’s orange-blond hair\ncolor.\n\nFather and daughter got along almost peculiarly well. She was the real mini-Trump (a\ntitle that many people now seemed to aspire to). She accepted him. She was a helper not\njust in his business dealings, but in his marital realignments. She facilitated entrances and\nexits. If you have a douchebag dad, and if everyone is open about it, then maybe it\nbecomes fun and life a romantic comedy—sort of.\n\nReasonably, she ought to be much angrier. She grew up not just in the middle of a\ntroubled family but in one that was at all times immersed in bad press. But she was able to\nbifurcate reality and live only in the uppermost part of it, where the Trump name, no\nmatter how often tarnished, nevertheless had come to be an affectionately tolerated\npresence. She resided in a bubble of other wealthy people who thrived on their\nrelationship with one another—at first among private school and Upper East Side of\nManhattan friends, then among social, fashion, and media contacts. What’s more, she\ntended to find protection as well as status in her boyfriends’ families, aggressively bonding\nwith a series of wealthy suitors’ families—including Jamie Johnson’s before the Kushners\n—over her own.\n\nThe Ivanka-Jared relationship was shepherded by Wendi Murdoch, herself a curious\nsocial example (to nobody so much as to her then husband, Rupert). The effort among a\nnew generation of wealthy women was to recast life as a socialite, turning a certain model\nof whimsy and noblesse oblige into a new status as a power woman, a kind of postfeminist\nsocialite. In this, you worked at knowing other rich people, the best rich people, and of\nbeing an integral and valuable part of a network of the rich, and of having your name itself\nevoke, well ... riches. You weren’t satisfied with what you had, you wanted more. This\nrequired quite a level of indefatigability. You were marketing a product—yourself. You\nwere your own start-up.\n\nThis was what her father had always done. This, more than real estate, was the family\nbusiness.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019944",
