  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\nwho have little interest in the democratizing mission\ntraditionally espoused by mainstream parties with deep\nroots in the global struggles of the 20th century. The\nnew mood is reflected in the democracies foreign poli-\ncies, many of which are aimed more at seeking national\nadvantage than at promoting the common good.\n\nThe rise of populist politics in democracies could give\nmodern authoritarianism a new lease on life. While it\nmay no longer be as useful for entrenched autocracies\nto mask their nature with an illusion of pluralism, free-\nly elected leaders with authoritarian ambitions can\nuse similar techniques to replace genuine democratic\ninstitutions with hollowed-out fagades. This process\n\nis already under way in the countries that have been\ndubbed “illiberal democracies.\"\n\nWith states across the spectrum shifting in an\nauthoritarian direction, there is not much comfort in\nthe fact that repressive regimes are fundamentally\nmore unstable and vulnerable to breakdowns than\ndemocracies. Major authoritarian governments may\ncollapse in the face of economic crises, popular\nprotests, or succession battles. But in the absence of\ninternational pressure and support, it seems doubt-\nful that they would be replaced by aspiring democra-\ncies. Indeed, they could be succeeded by something\neven worse.\n\n1.
