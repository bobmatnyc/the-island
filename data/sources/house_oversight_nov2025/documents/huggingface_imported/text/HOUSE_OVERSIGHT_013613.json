  "text": "Semiophysics, discusses mathematical mechanisms and their representations in\nmind and the real world, analogizing mathematical objects and the intuitions they\ngenerate to mechanical tools. Similar ideas are found among the four liberal arts of\nthe ancients: Number, Geometry, Music and Cosmology. The epistemologies of all\nfour require, then and now, the intuitive use of mathematical objects, conscious or\nunconscious. Examples can be found in conceptual issues of Geometry and\nNumber with implications for relationships between man’s physical and\npsychological worlds. One set of articulations were attributed to the shapes of\nPlatonic solids found among the Neolithic stone circles in Aberdeenshire, Scotland,\n2000 years before Plato. Each symbolized particular physical and psychological\nthemes. All manifested equal edges and every face of each solid was the same\nperfect polygon. The solid with four equilateral triangles manifesting four vertices\nand faces, the tetrahedron, represented the physical element, Fire, and the\npersonal psychological climate of a choleric, fiery nature. A Platonic solid composed\nof eight equilateral triangular faces, two tetrahedrons annealed, the octahedron,\nsignified Air in physical composition and optimistic hopefulness in psychological\ndisposition. Six square faces together making a cube, evoked the elemental\nphysical component, Earth, and its human expression as a phlegmatic, apathetic\npersonal style. Twenty faces, all equilateral triangles, constitute an icosahedron\nindicating Water and a dominant feeling state of melancholic sadness. Like\nonomatopoeic words and pictorial script, the three dimensional geometry of these\nPlatonic solids feel like what they came to symbolize.\n\nThe personality styles symbolized and evoked by the Platonic solids continue\nto be used to this day. For example, they compose the basic elements of the\nconstitutional categories of remedy in homeopathic medicine as introduced over\n200 years ago by Dr. Samuel Hahnemann in his classical Organon of the Medical\nArt. The assignment of clinical remedy in homeopathic treatment combines\nconsideration of the presenting physical symptoms and signs, the what, with\nintuitive discernment of the patient’s constitutional type, the who. To the\nhomeopathic physician, tetrahedral fire is suggested by the traits of personal\n\nmagnetism, courage and inspiration as well as egotism, strong desire and rage.\n\n113\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013613",
