  "text": "This smoothness-dependent intuition of determinism breaks down in nonlinear\nequations as well as in a wide variety of the machines of experimental physics, from\nthe sudden coherent lasing of previously incoherent light to the vortices and\nturbulence in suitably bounded rotating or flowing fluid. It took me a while for these\ntopological still shots and movies of the head to become real. Nevertheless, the\nenrichment of intuition was well worth it. Of course one could smoothly increase the\nnormal factor weight of a ship until it gradually sank, but if one moved the center of\ngravity splitting factor to an eccentric position in the ship in the parameter region of\nthe bifurcation set, a sudden global capsize before weight-induced gradual sinking\nmade sense. | could see it. Indeed, increasing normal factor tension in a prison\npopulation that was identified, not alienated, from the officials and mores of the\npenal institution, would increase social symptomotology gradually. However,\nincreasing the splitting factor of social and institutional alienation results in the\ncataclysmic change of a riot with increasing tension. | could see it.\n\nDo we need to know the causal equations to anticipate instability and\ndiscontinuity in our lives? Zeeman making Thom’s thoughts accessible to us plain\nmortals said no. He suggested that we could use several diagnostic\nphenomenological signs to make a good guess about whether we are near or within\nthe bifurcation set. Depending upon the route that the causal variables take through\nthe shadow of the bifurcation set, we may see very large fluctuations in our\nobservable. The Dow or S&P stock indices in the neighborhood of a sudden large\nchange is often presaged, sometimes for weeks, by a marked increase in volatility,\nfluctuations between extreme values. Theorists call the statistical properties of a\ntime series of values behaving this way anomalous variance.

A sudden change in a stock index in\nresponse to the “shock” of a terrorist attack takes much /onger to settle down if a\ncataclysmically bigger change is in the neighborhood. This extension of the\n\nsystem’s usual relaxation time is sometimes called critical slowing. In the bifurcation\n\n59\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013559",
