Mr. Epstein:

Many, many thanks for your overwhelming generosity. Catherine and I flew home today with
Mr. Farkas and his family. They took very good care of us and they couldn't have been nicer.
Andrew and Caroline are still stuck in St. Thomas, enjoying the use of your car.

We are extremely grateful for everything you have done for us.

Happy New Year and hope to see you next time you are at Harvard.

Fondly,
Kelly Friendly
