  "text": "inclusion limit articulated by the MSCI (currently 0.2), we are able to decipher the\nrelative weighting of Saudi Arabia if it were to be included the MSCI EM index.\n\nThis analysis suggests that Saudi’s potential weighting in the MSCI EM Index (were it to\nbe included today) would be c1.4%. Furthermore, it would likely trigger net inflows (from\nother MSCI EM markets) of US$10.9bn when including all passive and benchmark-\nneutral active funds tracking MSCI EM. Importantly, our analysis is based on EPFR data,\nwhich respectively indicates US$405bn and US$354bn of active and passive funds\nfollowing the MSCI EM index.\n\nTable 14: Provisional MSCI Saudi Arabia constituents stand to gain as much as $10.9bn of total passive and benchmark-neutral active funds on inclusion\n\nPotential Total US$m Total days\nProvisional Provisional Potential Potential passive Potential active + active +\nweight in MSCI weight in MSCI ADTVactive buying active days buying passive days passive days passive days\nSaudi EM buying US$m buyi buying buying\nAL RAJHI BANK 9.5% 0.1% 37.2 546.5 14.7 477.7 12.8 1,024 27.5\nALINMA BANK 2.0% 0.0% 223.0 116.9 0.5 102.2 0.5 219 1.0\nALMARAI 44% 0.1% ip. 255.8 33.1 223.6 28.9 479 62.0\nARAB NATIONAL BANK 2.0% 0.0% 1.4 113.6 81.7 99.3 14 213 153.2\nBANQUE SAUDI FRANSI 2.8% 0.0% 3 163.1 122.7 142.6 107.2 306 229.9\nETIHAD ETISALAT CO. 2.2% 0.0% 11.9 126.1 10.6 110.2 9.2 236 19.8\nRABIGH REFN.& PETROCH. 1.0% 0.0% 9.2 59.1 6.5 51.7 5.6 111 12.1\nRIYAD BANK 3.4% 0.0% 2.0 195.6 100.3 170.9 87.7 367 188.0\nSAMBA FINANCIAL GROUP 4.0% 0.1% 5.0 232.9 47.0 203.5 41.1 436 88.2\nSAUDI ARABIA FRTZ. 2.6% 0.0% 44 148.2 33.5 129.5 29.2 278 62.7\nSAUDI ARABIAN MINING 4.5% 0.1% 17.2 260.8 15.1 228.0 13.2 489 28.3\nSAUDI BASIC INDUSTRIES 25.3% 0.4% 170.9 1459.4 8.5 1275.6 75 2,735 16.0\nSAUDI ELECTRICITY 8.4% 0.1% 6.3 485.3 17.3 424.2 67.6 910 144.8\nSAUDI TELECOM 13.4% 0.2% 9.5 114.7 82.0 677.1 N77 1,452 153.6\nSAVOLA GROUP 2.0% 0.0% 6.9 114.4 16.6 100.0 14.5 214 3112\nYANBU NAT.PETROCH. 2.3% 0.0% 6.7 134.5 20.2 117.6 177 252 37.9\nFAWAZ ABDULAZIZ ALHOKAIR 1.0% 0.0% 5.7 55.5 9.7 48.5 8.5 104 18.1\nALTAYYAR 0.8% 0.0% 38:5 44.4 1.3 38.8 1.2 83 25\nNATIONAL COMMERCIAL BANK 8.2% 0.1% 6.8 474.8 70.1 415.0 61.3 890 131.4\nTOTAL 5,762 5,036 10,798\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MSCI and DataStream\n\nChart 51: If included today, Saudi Arabia would be the thirteenth largest constituent of the MSCI EM,\naccounting for 1.4% of the index.\n\nm CHINA\n\nm KOREA\n\nm@ TAIWAN\n\nm@ INDIA\n\nm@ SOUTH AFRICA\n\nm@ BRAZIL\nMEXICO\n\nm RUSSIA\n\n= MALAYSIA (EM)\n\n= INDONESIA\n\nm= THAILAND\n\n~ PHILIPPI\n\nm SAUDI\n\n= TURKEY\n\n= CHILE\n\nm= POLAND\n\n@ QATAR\n\nm UAE\n\nm= COLOMBIA\n\nm PERU\n\nm GREECE\n\nm HUNGARY\nEGYPT\n\nm@ CZECH REPUBLIC\n\nSource: : BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MSCI and DataStream\n\n46 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016156",
