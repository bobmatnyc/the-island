No wonder Trump told him, “It’ s an honor to be with you.”\nNow Putin wanted Obama’ s new sanctions on Russia to be reprieved.\n\nNational Security Adviser Michael Flynn had discussed it with the\nRussian ambassador a month before Trump took office. Although General\nFlynn joined his campaign and shared criminal secrets, he denied them to\nthe FBI. It was a felony offense. The Justice Department warned Trump that\nFlynn had misled Mike Pence, and that Flynn could be vulnerable to\nblackmail. Trump asked Flynn to resign, and yet he offered his job back\nwhen he got out of prison. Why? Because Flynn was the scapegoat, taking\nthe fall for the president and vice-president. He preferred a trial with\nimmunity since they knew all. Pence said Flynn lied and that was a lie.\n\nIf Trump and Pence were both to be kicked out of the White House,\nthe next in line would be the Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan. Steve\nBannon described him as_ “a limp-dick motherfucker who was born in a\npetri dish at the Heritage Foundation.” In turn, Trunp’ s communicator\nAnthony Scaramucci boasted, “I’ m not Steve Bannon, |’ m not trying to\nsuck my own cock.” Ah, but Bannon said he wanted to destroy Ryan.\n\nHallelujah!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015458",
