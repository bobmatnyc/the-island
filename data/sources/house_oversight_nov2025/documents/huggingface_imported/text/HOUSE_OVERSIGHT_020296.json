But since she had not\nbeen the author of the Der Spiegel article, and it had not been given the document, there is no\nreason to she would know its provenance.\n\nThe post-Hong Kong documents did not stop with the Merkel one. Documents continued to\nemerge years after Snowden arrived in Moscow. In June 2015, for example, the Wikileaks\nwebsite released another putative Snowden document two years after he had supposedly wiped\nhis computer clean in Hong Kong. It revealed that the NSA had targeted the telephones of the\nthree consecutive presidents of France-- Jacque Chirac, Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande,\nall of whom were allies of the United States. Moreover, according to a former NSA official, this\n2015 document, like the 2013 Merkel material, not among the data on the thumb drive given to\njournalists in Hong Kong. The released on the Wikileaks site came at an embarrassing time since\nin the midst of NATO war games held near the Russian border, which Putin had vehemently\ndenounced, The accompanying article was co-authored by Julian Assange, who now claimed to\nhave access to Snowden’s NSA material. Since Assange, it will be recalled, had been in\ntelephonic contact with Snowden in Hong Kong and his deputy, Sarah Harrison, had spent five\nmonths in Moscow with Snowden in 2013, it is certainly possible Snowden was his source. But it\nseems difficult to believe that Assange waited two years before publishing since he has made it\npart of his modus operandi to publish documents immediately. And since Wikileaks receives\ndocuments anonymously via its TOR software, any party, with access the Snowden files, could\nhave sent it.\n\nGreenwald and Poitras also released belated documents. On July 15, 2015, for example, their\nweb publication Zhe Intercept released a Snowden document that t cited a NSA intercept of Israeli\nmilitary communications about an Israeli raid in Syria on August 1, 2008. It revealed that in it a group of\nIsraeli commandos killed General Suleiman, a top aide to President Assad who had been working with\nNorth Korea to build a nuclear facility in Syria. Israel had destroyed that facility in Operation Orchard\nnearly a year earlier. Whatever the purpose of this new release of a NSA document (which had little, if\nanything, to do with any of the NSA’s own operations); it was not among the data that Snowden had given\nPoitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong in 2013, according to a source with access to the investigation. If so\nPoitras and Greenwald, like Appelbaum and Assange, were still receiving NSA documents that Snowden\nhad allegedly stolen a long time after he claimed he had destroyed all his files.\n\nThe NSA reportedly determined that these belated documents, all of which concerned American allies in\nGermany, France and Israel, had been among the material copied during the Snowden breach. They\nprovided further reason to believe that someone still had access to the documents that were not distributed\nto journalists in Hong Kong. Kucherena’s disclosure just before the first post-Hong Kong release that\nSnowden still had access to the NSA files made it appear plausible that Snowden sent these documents to\nDer Spiegel, Wikileaks and The Intercept. A former high-ranking KGB officer I interviewed had a very\ndifferent view. He told me that in his experience an intelligence defector to Russia would not be allowed\nto distribute secret material to journalists without explicit approval by the security service tending him. ,\nand that this injunction would be especially true in the case of Snowden after Putin publicly had forbade\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020296",
