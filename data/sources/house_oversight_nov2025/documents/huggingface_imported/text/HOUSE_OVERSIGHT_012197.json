Lefkowitz, Esq. \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \nCitigroup Center \n153 East 53rd Street • \nNew York, New York 10022-4675 \nRe: Jeffrey Epstein \nU.S. Department of Justice \nUnited States Attorney \nSouthern District of Florida \n99 PIE. 4 Street \nMiami, FL 33132 \n(305) 961-9100 \nMay 19, 2008 \nDear Mr. Lefkowitz, \nI am in receipt of your e-mail dated May 19, 2008 to the United States Attorney. The U.S. \nAttorney would like me to advise you that all communications and inquiries related to the Epstein \nmatter, will be handled by AUSA Marie Villafana and/or her supervisor, Karen Atkinson, so he does \nnot intend to respond to your e-mail or calls unless AUSA Villafana and/or her supervisors advise \nhim otherwise. Furthermore, you make reference to \"our July 8 deadline.\" Respectfully, the United \nStates Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (\"SDFL\") has never agreed to any such \ndeadline. Should you decide to provide the SDFL with any additional information, please do so \nthrough AUSA Villafana, and, in her absence, AUSA Atkinson. \nOn September 24, 2007, your client, Jeffrey Epstein, in consultation with Gerald Lefcourt, \nEsq. and Lilly Ann Sanchez, Esq., as well as numerous other nationally-renowned lawyers, including \nbut not limited to Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, former Independent Counsel and \nSolicitor General of the United States Kenneth Starr, just to name a few, entered into a global \nresolution of state and federal liabilities faced by your client (\"the Agreement\") with the SDFL. \nAlthough you and other members of the defense team have since claimed that the Agreement was \nthe product of adhesion, the following facts demonstrate that Epstein knowingly and voluntarily \nentered into the Agreement in order to avoid a federal indictment regarding his sexual conduct \ninvolving minor victims. Despite the fact that by signing the Agreement, Epstein gave up the right \nto object to its provisions, the SDFL bent over backwards to exhaustively consider and re-consider \nyour objections. Since these objections have finally been exhausted and Epstein has previously \nexpressed his intent to not comply with several of the terms and conditions of the Agreement as set \nforth below, the SDFL hereby notifies you that unless he complies with all of the terms and \nconditions of the Agreement, as modified by the United States Attorney's December 19,2007 letter \nto Ms. Sanchez by close of business on Monday, June 2, 2008, the SDFL will elect to terminate the \nAgreement. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012198 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nMay 19, 2008 \nPAGE 2 OF 6 \nBackground \nThe Agreement was the product of months of negotiations. Specifically, you requested and \nreceived numerous meetings, at the highest levels of the SDFL and DOJ's Child Exploitation and \nObscenity Section (CEOS) concerning claims that (a) the investigation merely produced evidence \nof relatively innocuous sexual conduct with some minors who, unbeknownst to Epstein, \nmisrepresented their ages; (b) the authorities investigating Epstein engaged in misconduct; (c) the \ncontemplated federal statutes have no applicability to this matter; and (d) the federal authorities \ndisregarded the fundamental policy against federal intervention with state criminal proceedings. \nAfter careful review, the SDFL ultimatelyrejected those claims. Subsequent to its decision, however, \nbut before proceeding any further, the SDFL provided you with 30 days to appeal the decision to the \nAssistant Attorney General of the United States, Alice Fisher. As you recall, you chose to forego an \nappeal to AAG Fisher, and instead pursued a negotiated resolution which, ultimately, resulted in the \nexecution of the Agreement. \nThe Negotiation Phase \nDuring negotiations, you tried to avoid a resolution that called for incarceration and \nregistration as a sexual offender — both of which would be triggered by a successful federal \nprosecution. The SDFL believed and continues to believe that should this matter proceed to trial, \nyour client would be convicted of the federal statutes identified in the Agreement. In order to achieve \na global resolution, the SDFL indicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration; \nhowever, it remained adamant that Epstein register as a sex offender and that all victims identified \nduring the investigation remain eligible for compensation. In order to achieve this result, the parties \nconsidered two alternatives, a plea to federal charges that limited Epstein's sentencing exposure, or, \nas suggested by you, a plea to state charges encompassing Epstein's conduct. Ultimately, the parties \nagreed to, inter alio, a plea to the state charges outlined in the Agreement, registration and a method \nof compensation. \nThe Agreement \nThe crux of the Agreement defers in favor of the State federal prosecution of Epstein for his \nsexual conduct involving those minor victims identified as of September 24, 2007, in exchange for \na guilty plea to a state . offense that requires registration as a sex offender; a sufficient term of \nimprisonment; and a method of compensation for the victims such that they would be placed in the \nsame position as if Epstein had been convicted of one of the enumerated offenses set forth in Title \n18, United States Code, Section 2255. Specifically, the Agreement mandates, inter alia, (1) a guilty \nplea in Palm Beach County Circuit Court to solicitation of prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.07) and \nprocurement of minors to engage in prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.03) (an offense that requires \nhim to register as a sex offender); (2) a 30-month sentence including 18 months' incarceration in \ncounty jail; (3) a methodology to compensate the victims identified by the United States; (4) entry \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012199 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nMay 19, 2008 \nPAGE 3 OF 6 \nof the guilty plea and sentence no later than October 26, 2007; and (5) the start of the above-\nmentioned sentence no later than January 4, 2008. \nFurthermore, and significantly, Epstein agreed that he had the burden of ensuring compliance \nof the Agreement with the Palm Beach County State Attorney's Office and the Judge of the 15th \nJudicial Circuit and \"that the failure to do so will be a breach of the agreement\" (emphasis added). \nPost-Execution of the Agreement \nWithin weeks of the execution of the Agreement, you sought to delay the entry of Epstein's \nguilty plea and sentence. After the SDFL agreed to accommodate your request, counsel for Epstein \nbegan taking issue with the methodology of compensation, notification to the victims, and the issues \nthat had been previously considered and rejected during negotiations, i.e., that the conduct does not \nrequire registration and the contemplated state and federal statutes have no applicability to the instant \nmatter. \nA. Delay. \nThe Agreement required that \"Epstein shall use his best efforts to enter his guilty plea and \nbe sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. The United States has no objection to Epstein self-\nreporting to begin serving his sentence not later than January 4, 2008.\" Agreement, pages 4-5, \nparagraph 11 (emphasis added). After the Agreement was executed, the SDFL accommodated your \nrequest to extend the October 26th plea deadline to November 20th based upon, what seemed to be, \nreasonable scheduling conflict issues.' By early November, you represented that the presiding state \ncourtjudge would not \"stagger the plea and sentencing as contemplated in the Agreement.\"Although \nthe Agreement clearly did not contemplate a staggered \"plea and sentencing,\" the SDFL again agreed \nto accommodate Epstein's request to appear in state court for plea and sentencing on January 4, \n2008.2 \nI \"Accordingly, I have now confirmed with Mr. Epstein's Florida counsel that the state's \nattorney's office and the court will be available to have him enter his plea on November 20. So we will \nplan to proceed on one that date.\" October 18;2007 email from Jay Lefkowitz to USA R. Alexander \nAcosta. \nOn the same day, Mr. Lefkowitz confirmed with First Assistant Jeffrey H. Sloman that this \npostponement \" will not affect when Epstein begins serving his sentence.\" \n2 Correspondence from Jay Lefkowitz to FAUSA Sloman dated November 8, 2007 (\"the judge \nhas invited the parties to appear for the plea and sentencing on January 41, we do not anticipate any delay \nbeyond that date.\") \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012200 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nMay 19, 2008 \nPAGE 4 OF 6 \nB. Method of Compensation and Notification. \nDuring this same time period, you and others, including the former Solicitor General of the \nUnited States Kenneth Starr, took issue with the implementation of the methodology of \ncompensation (hereinafter \"the 2255 provision\")3 and the SDFL's intention to notify the victims \nunder 18 U.S.C. Section 3771 (you objected to victims being notified of time and place of Epstein' s \nstate court sentencing hearing). In response, the SDFL offered, in my opinion, numerous and various \nreasonable modifications and accommodations which ultimately resulted in United States Attorney \nR. Alexander Acosta's December 19, 2007 letter to Lilly Ann Sanchez. In that letter, the United \nStates Attorney tried to eliminate all concerns which, quite frankly, the SDFL was not obligated to \naddress, let alone consider. He proposed the following language regarding the 2255 provision: \n\"Any person, who while a minor, was a victim of a violation of an offense enumerated in \nTitle 18, United States Code, Section 2255, will have the same rights to proceed under \nSection 2255 as she would have had, if Mr. Epstein been tried federally and convicted of an \nenumerated offense. For purposes of implementing this paragraph, the United States shall \nprovide Mr. Epstein's attorneys with a list of individuals whom it was prepared to name in \nan Indictment as victims of an enumerated offense by Mr. Epstein. Any judicial authority \ninterpreting this provision, including any authority determining which evidentiary burdens \nif any a plaintiff must meet, shall consider that it is the intent of the parties to place these \nidentified victims in the same position as they would have been had Mr. Epstein been \nconvicted at trial. No more; no less.\" \nRegarding the issue of notice to the victims, USA Acosta proposed to notify them of the \nfederal resolution as required by law; however, IN* will defer to the discretion of the State \nAttorney regarding whether he wishes to provide victims with notice of the state proceedings, \nalthough we will provide him with the information necessary to do so if he wishes.\" As you know, \nyou rejected these proposals as well. See December 26, 2007 correspondence from Jay Lefkowitz \nto USA Acosta. \n3 Prior to any issues arising concerning the implementation of the 2255 provision, the SDFL \nunilaterally agreed to assign its responsibility to select the attorney representative for the alleged victims \nto an independent third-party. This was done to avoid even the appearance of favoritism in the selection \nof the attorney representative. As a result, on October 29, 2007, the parties executed an Addendum \nwherein it was mutually agreed that former United States District Court Judge Edward B. Davis would \nserve as the independent third-party. Judge Davis selected the venerable law firm of Podhurst and \nJosefsberg to represent the approximately 34 alleged identified victims. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012201 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nMay 19, 2008 \nPAGE 5 OF 6 \nC. \"Mr. Epstein Does Not Believe He Is Guilty Of The Federal Charges Enumerated \nUnder Section 2255.\" \nAt our December 14, 2007 meeting at the U.S. Attorney's Office in Miami, counsel for \nEpstein announced, inter alia, that it was a \"profound injustice\" to require Epstein to register as a \nsex offender and reiterated that no federal crime, especially 18 U.S.C. Section 2422(b), had been \ncommitted since the statute is only violated if a telephone or means of interstate commerce is used \nto do the persuading or inducing. This particular attack on this statute had been previously raised and \nthoroughly considered and rejected by the SDFL and CEOS prior to the execution of the Agreement. \nYou also argued that the facts were inapplicable to the contemplated state statutes and that Epstein \nshould not have been allowed to have been induced into the Agreement because the facts were not \nwhat he understood them to be. It should be noted that the SDFL has never provided you with any \nevidence supporting its investigation. This is not, and has never been, an Alford plea situation (see \nNorth Carolina v. Alford, 400 U.S. 25, 91 S.Ct. 160 (1970)). Ultimately, you requested an \nindependent review. \nSubsequent to the above-mentioned meeting, the SDFL received three letters from you and/or \nMr. Starr which expanded on some of the themes announced in the December 14th meeting. \nEssentially, you portrayed the SDFL as trying to coercea plea to unknown allegations and incoherent \ntheories. On December 17, 2007, you decreed that Epstein's conduct did not meet the requirements \n•of solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution (Fl. Stat. Section 796.03) one of the enumerated \ncrimes Epstein had previously agreed to plead guilty to; that Epstein's conduct does not require \nregistration under Florida law; and the State Attorney's Office does not believe the conduct is \nregistrable. On December 21, 2007, you rejected the USA's proposed resolution of the 2255 \nprovision because you \"strongly believe that the provable conduct of Mr. Epstein with respect to \nthese individuals fails to satisfy the requisite elements of either 18 U.S.C. Section[s] 2422(b) ... or \n2423(b).\" In your December 26, 2007 correspondence you stated that \"we have reiterated in \nprevious submissions that Mr. Epstein does not believe he is guilty of the federal charges enumerated \nunder section 2255\" and requiring \"Mr. Epstein to in essence admit guilt, though he believes he did \nnot commit the requisite offense.\" \nAs the SDFL has reiterated time and time again, it does not want, nor does it expect, Epstein \nto plead guilty to a charge he does not believe he committed. As a result, we obliged your request \nfor an independent de novo review of the investigation and facilitated such a review at the highest \nlevels of the Department of Justice. It is our understanding that that independent review is now \ncomplete and a determination has been made that there are no impediments to a federal prosecution \nby the SDFL. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012202 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nMay 19, 2008 \nPAGE 6 OF 6 \nConclusion \nOn February 25, 2008, I sent you an e-mail setting forth a timetable for moving forward in \nthe event that CEOS disagreed with your position. That time is now. As you know, my February 25th \nemail stated that I would give you one week to comply with the terms and conditions of the \nAgreement, as modified by the USA's December 19th letter to Ms. Sanchez. In light of the upcoming \nMemorial Day weekend, I have decided to extend that timetable to the close of business on Monday, \nJune 2, 2008, which is a full two weeks. \nSincerely, \nR.

As you know, that agreement requires our \nOffice to inform you of potential breaches to give you and your client the opportunity to respond \nbefore an indictment is filed. At this time, I do not believe that the agreement has been breached; \nhowever, I have sufficient concerns that need to be addressed. \nFirst, I understand that private investigators working for Mr. Epstein have contacted victims \nto ask them whether any detectives or FBI agents have discussed a financial settlement with them. \nOn one occasion, the private investigators told the parent of a victim that she should get an attorney \nfor her daughter and she should do so right away. These actions are troublesome because the FBI \nagents legally are required to advise the victims of the resolution or the matter, which includes \ninforming them that, as part of the resolution, that Mr. Epstein has agreed to pay damages in some \ncircumstances. Furthermore, Mr. Epstein well knows that we are in the process of selecting an \nattorney to represent the victims and, but for the inordinate amount of time spent negotiating the \nAddendum, that attorney would already have been selected. Paragraph 7 of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement explicitly provides that contact with the victims shall be through that counsel. \nAccordingly, please confirm that there will be no further efforts to contact any victims until Judge \nDavis selects the attorney representative and that, thereafter, contact will be made only through that \ncounsel. \nSecond, the Non-Prosecution Agreement requires Mr. Epstein to use his best efforts to enter \nhis guilty plea and to be sentenced not later than October 26, 2007. Despite this obligation, the \nOffice agreed that Mr. Epstein could postpone this deadline to November, but reiterated that Mr. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012206 \n11/05/2007 11:27 FAX \n11/05/07 MON 10:00 FAX 305 530 6440 \nEXECUTIVE OFFICE \nel 003/003 \nVI nos \nJAY P. IxpKowrinz, ESQ. \nNov2mt:IER 5, 2007 \nPACE 2 OF 2 \nEpstein had to begin his term of incarceration not later than January 4, 2008. I have learned that the \nNovember hearing has been removed from the calendar and the next case disposition conference has \nnot been set until January 7, 2008. This delay is unacceptable, and, pursuant to your obligations, the \nOffice requests that you confer with the State Attorney's Office to try to find a date in November \nwhen the judge is available to conduct a simultaneous plea and sentencing, if you cannot find such \na date, please provide documentation of your efforts to abide by the terms of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement. \nThird, there have been several press reports that Mr. Epstein no longer intends to enter a \nguilty plea. Normally I would not pay any attention to such reports, but your recent correspondence \nattempting to restrict our office from communicating with the State .Attorney's Office and the \nallusion to the imposition of sentences that clearly fall outside the terms of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreernent raises concern. Please confirm that Mr. Epstein intends to abide by his agreement to \nplead guilty to the specified charges and to make a binding recommendation that the Court impose \na sentence of 18 months of continuous confinement in the county jail. \nFinally, the Non-Prosecution Agreement requires that you provide the Office with copies of \nall proposed agreements with the State Attorney's Office before Mr. Epstein signs any such \nagreements. To date, no such agreements have been received. Please provide me with copies of any \nand all agreements with the State Attorney's Office for our review. The Office also would like to \nhave someone present at the change ofplea and sentencing to monitorMr, Epstein's compliance with \nthe terms of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, so please keep me informed of the date, time, and \nlocation of the hearing. \nPlease provide me with a written response, adopted by Mr. Epstein, addressing these \nconcerns and reiterating Mr. Epstein's intention to comply with the tenns of the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement by November 8, 2007. \nBy: \nCO: R.

She \nsaid, \"He may ask you to do other things.\" \nQ. But no one was asking you before you --\nA. No one was telling me that I had to do \n3 \nanything. She was just stating that it was a possibility 2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012263 \n5or 8,1A55ociates \nRsportiag ixad traum-iption, \n1 he may ask me to do other things. \n2 \nPage 9 \nQ. Most importantly though, before you went \n3 over there, no one tried to persuade you to engage in any \n4 kind of sex? \n5 A. No, no one persuaded me. \n6 \nQ. No one was inducing you or enticing you to \n7 do any kind of sex? \n8 \nA. No. \n9 Q. \nOkay. And certainly no one that had any \n10 association with Mr. Epstein tried to persuade you or \n11 induce you to engage in any kind of sex? \n12 \nA. NO. \n13 Q. Okay.

Totally within my rights to do whatever \n17 wanted to do. \n18 Q. And I assume she told you that if anything \n19 was asked of you, whether you wanted to do anything else, \n20 I assume told you that Mr. Epstein would \n21 absolutely respect that. In other words, if you were \n22 asked to do anything and you said no, he would say, \n23 \"Fine. I understand.\" \n24 A. Yeah. Because he told me in the room if \n25 didn't want to -- whatever I didn't want to do, just say \netdaskcisosax. * T \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012264 \nno and he said that was fine. \n2 Q. Okay. \n3 A.

I know the answer to this is \n16 obvious, because you only went there to Mr. Epstein's \n17 house one time, but I've got to ask you this. You never \n18 traveled anywhere with Mr. Epstein, did you? \n19 A. No. \n20 Q. You never left the state to meet with \n21 Mr. Epstein, did you? \n22 A. No. Heard other girls did. \n23 Q. Okay.

The Department has \nsignificant concerns, which are detailed below in a section-by-section analysis. The proposed \nlegislation, as drafted, would eliminate the Department's role in several important steps in the \nvictim identification process, and thereby negatively impact our ability to ensure the safety of \nvictims and their families, rescue additional victims, and apprehend and prosecute human \ntraffickers; it would broaden the criminal statutes regarding prosecution in a manner that detracts \nfrom effective enforcement efforts and raises serious federalism implications; and it would \nunconstitutionally intrude into Executive authority. \n1. Section 102 \nThe provision in subsection (e)(2)(B) authorizing the Director of the Office to Monitor \nand Combat Trafficking in Persons (G/TIP) at the Department of State to interview victims \nshould clarify that the Director is authorized to do so only with the consent of the Attorney \nGeneral in any case where an ongoing investigation or prosecution may exist. Otherwise, \nserious issues could arise that would complicate or even scuttle prosecution. For example, any \nstatements made to the Director would presumptively have to be turned over to the defense and \nany statements that contradict statements made to law enforcement or prosecutors would be \nrequired to be turned over to the defense. \n2. Section 103 \nDOI finds section 103 unnecessary and duplicative of existing efforts and, therefore, \nopposes its inclusion in the bill_ DOJ and other Federal agencies are already offering the types \nof assistance that are described in the section. Furthermore, the new subsection (a)(i)(3) would \nrequire the United States Government to provide \"technical assistance to provide legal \nframeworks and other programs to foreign governments and nongovernmental organizations to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012372 \nensure that foreign migrant workers are provided protection equal to nationals of the foreign \ncountry.\" This provision does not differentiate between legal and non-legal migrant workers, nor \ndoes it distinguish between forced labor and non-coerced migrant labor. DOJ believes that any \ninternational standard that we promote must mirror our domestic standards. Similarly, the new \nsubsection (a)(i)(4) could be read as encouraging countries to loosen their immigration Iaws, \n'something that the United States Government might not be willing to do. \nSubsection (b) amends the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 (22 U.S.C. § 2151 et seq) to \nprovide specific assistance for anti-trafficking investigation and prosecution units in foreign \ncountries. This subsection could be construed as prioritizing sex trafficking over labor \ntrafficking. As stated above, DOJ believes that any international standard that we promote must \nmirror our domestic standards, which prioritize both sex trafficking and labor trafficking. \nFurther, the amendment to 22 U.S.C. § 2152(d)(a)(2) should include a reference to labor \ntrafficking and should, therefore, read \"including investigation of individuals and entities that \nmay be involved in trafficking in persons involving sexual exploitation or forced labor.\" \n3. Section 104 \nThe Department objects to the language in this section that specifies the groups with \nwhich the United States Government must consult and coordinate in offering assistance and \nprotection to victims of human trafficking. Such language both places undue restrictions on the \nUnited States Government and could limit the Government's ability to deal with some necessary \ngroups. It has been the consistent practice of the Department to consult widely with a range of \nstake holders and others before designing a program of foreign assistance on human trafficking. \nSuch an additional requirement in the statutory language is unnecessary. We suggest that the \nlanguage be amended to read, \"[l]n cooperation and coordination with organizations which may \ninclude the [UNHCl2], the International Organization [for] Migration, and other relevant \norganizations....\" \n4. Section 105 \nDOJ recommends that subsection (a) also require that the effectiveness of assistance \nprograms be measured based on best efforts to facilitate cooperation with law enforcement, along \nwith the other criteria. \n5. Section 106 \nDOJ opposes the bar in subsection (b)(1) against including cases in which probation or \nlow sentences are given. Some of the most important cases are the ones against cooperating \ndefendants that result in minimal sentences in exchange for information or testimony. Embassies \nshould have the discretion to take such situations into account when evaluating foreign \ngovernment efforts to combat trafficking. The Department recommends amending section \n(b)(1 )(B) by striking \"shall not be considered to be an\" and inserting in its place \"shall be \nconsidered on a case by case basis to determine if it will be considered an\" so that it will give the \nSecretary of State greater flexibility in evaluating the efforts of other countries. \n2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012373 \nThe Department also objects to the new paragraph (11), which lists as a criterion for \nascertaining whether the government in question has made \"serious and sustained\" efforts to \neliminate trafficking \"[w]hether the government has made serious and sustained efforts to reduce \ndemand for commercial sex acts and for participation in international sex tourism by nationals of \nthe country.\" We object to this language because it is vague and will, by implication, require the \nUnited States Government to evaluate itself under this \"serious and sustained\" standard. The \nDepatiment prefers the language that was added by the 2005 reauthorization of the Trafficking \nVictims Protection Act, which evaluated whether countries \"adopted measures\" to reduce \ndemand. \n6. Section 107 \nSection 107(a) of the Act raises separation of powers and Chadha concerns. Section \nI07(a) would add a new 22 U.S.C. § 7107(b)(3)(D), which would limit the amount of time that a \ncountry could remain on the Tier IT Watch List to two years, \"unless the Secretary of State \nprovides to the appropriate congressional committees credible evidence that\" the country had \ntaken certain steps to make significant efforts to counter trafficking. That provision further \nrequires that \"[s]uch credible evidence\" shall be provided to Congress in a report. \nTo the extent that section 107(a) purports to give congressional committees authority to \ndetermine whether the Secretary's decision to exempt a country from the watch list is based on \nsufficiently \"credible evidence,\" the provision would give the committees a role in executing the \nlaw that the Constitution does not allow. \"[O]nce Congress makes its choice in enacting \nlegislation, its participation ends. Congress can thereafter control the execution of its enactment \nonly indirectly—by passing new legislation\"—that complies with the bicameralism and \npresentment requirements of Article I. Bowsher v. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 733-34 (1986); ,sree also \nNS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 951-52, 958 (1983). To avoid this concern, we recommend \nreplacing \"provides to the appropriate congressional committees credible evidence\" with \n\"determines;\" and replacing \"Such credible evidence\" with \"Such determination.\" \n7. Section 108 \nDOJ opposes the requirement in section 108 to create a database \"combining all \napplicable data collected by each Federal department and agency represented on the Interagency \nTask Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking.\" The database would contain law enforcement \nsensitive information, which would prevent the data from being accessible to non-law \nenforcement agencies, many of which are a part of the interagency task force. Furthermore, such \na database would be difficult to create, particularly within the timeframe provided in the statute, \nbecause it would require information from multiple agencies that collect data in varying forms \nand levels of specificity. \n8. Section 109 \nThis section authorizes the President to establish an award for efforts against trafficking \nand directs him to establish procedures for selecting recipients of the award. DOJ opposes this \nprovision, as it interferes with the President's policy-making authority. \n3 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012374 \n9. Section. 110 \nThe Department opposes the statutory language in subsection I 10(a)(1)(B) that \nspecifically mentions the U.S. Government sponsored hotlines for reporting instances of \ntrafficking in persons. Statutorily providing for the names of the hotlines would interfere with \nthe President's policy-making authority to change the hotline structure at a later date. \nFurthermore, the Act, as written, misnames the hotlines. \n10. Section 201  \nIn section 201, the Department objects to the new subsection \"(bb).\" To the extent that \nsuch a subsection is necessary, a question that we defer to the Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS), the decision regarding cooperation should include the Attorney General in addition to the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, as it does in Section 201(b). \nDOI. defers to DHS in regard to subsection (a)(1)(E), although we would note that by \nremoving the \"unusual and severe harm\" standard, victims will be eligible for a T-visa upon a \nlower showing of \"extreme hardship.\" \nThe Department also defers to DHS in regard to subsection (a)(2), which would extend \nT-visas to parents and siblings of trafficking victims. As a factual matter, however, the provision \nshould be amended to strike any reference to \"as a result of the alien's cooperation with law \nenforcement.\" Traffickers threaten victims to intimidate them into compliance with traffickers' \ndemands and to retaliate for victims' escape, not because of law enforcement cooperation. It is \ncounter-factual to describe the pattern of threats and retaliation as linked to law enforcement \ncooperation, and disregards the fact that threats often only subside when law enforcement takes \nmeasures to secure the family or punish the traffickers and their associates who threaten victims' \nfamilies. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the reference to siblings encompasses both minor \nand adult siblings, and whether spouses and children of adult siblings would be eligible for a T-\nvisa. \nIn subsection (b), DOJ opposes the new subsection (8)(B), which grants sole authority to \nthe Secretary of DHS to consider whether \"extreme hardship\" exists. The new section, however, \nalso requires consultation with \"prosecutors,\" which presumably refers to prosecutors at DOJ, \nsince DOJ is the lead prosecutorial agency for cases involving human trafficking. Since these \nprosecutors are under the Attorney General's authority, the consultation requirement should \ninclude consultation with the Attorney General. \nSubsection (c)(1), which creates the new subsection (3)(A)(i) in section 107(c) of the \nTrafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA), should limit applications for continued presence to \nthose being made by \"Federal\" law enforcement officials. Limiting the applications to those \nsubmitted by Federal law enforcement assists in the victim identification process. The \nDepartment has established a memorandum of understanding with DHS that ensures that the \nDepartment's prosecutors are informed when investigators apply for continued presence. \nFurthermore, limiting the applications to those submitted by Federal law enforcement ensures the \nuniformity of standards in making the determination as to whether an individual is a victim of a \n4 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012375 \nsevere form of trafficking in persons and eligible for continued presence. Finally, Federal law \nenforcement involvement in the process allows Federal prosecutors the ability to identify \npatterns of human trafficking activity that might span multiple local law enforcement \njurisdictions. For these same reasons, the new subsection (3)(B) should add \"Federal\" before \n\"law enforcement\" to limit the authority to request parole for relatives to Federal law \nenforcement officials. \nThe new subsection (c)(3)(A)(ii) should add \"endeavor to\" after \"shall\" so that a legally \nactionable obligation is not created as to Federal law enforcement's role in protecting the safety \nof trafficking victims and family members. While the U.S. Government makes every effort to \nprotect trafficking victims, the statutory language, as written, could be construed to create a \nlegally cognizable right and could lead to litigation. \nIn the new subsection (c)(3)(A)(iii), DOJ opposes extending continued presence for the \nduration of a civil suit. It also raises the potential for abuse because of the lengthy and \nplaintiff/victim-controlled delays in conducting civil litigation. Furthermore, physical presence \nin the United States is not necessary for the successful maintenance of a civil action. Victims \nhave other options to obtain status in the United States, such as T- and U-visas. \nDOJ notes a technical change to subsection (d), which currently has two subsection (2)s. \nDOJ recommends striking the second \"(2)\" and replacing it with a \"(3).\" \n11. Section 202 \nThe Department opposes the language in section (a) that legislates the existence of a \nspecific task force, such as the Trafficking in Persons and Worker Exploitation Task Force. DOJ \nrecommends deletion of this reference and the replacement of the named task force with \"the \nAttorney General.\" \nDOJ also opposes the 120 day deadline in subsection (f) as unreasonable due to language \nbarriers and translation needs. \n12. Section 203 \nIn subsections (a), (b)(1-2), and (c), DOJ opposes the language removing the Attorney \nGeneral's role in determining whether the relevant applicant has complied with reasonable \nrequests for assistance, an important factor in the decisions regarding T-visas, and that the \ninvestigation or prosecution is complete. Because the Department is involved in its prosecutorial \nas well as its investigative roles, DOJ participation is critical in assessing assistance with law \nenforcement, and it is well-situated to assess whether a victim has complied with reasonable \nrequests for assistance that went through investigative agencies outside DHS, such as cases \ninvestigated by FBI or DOL. Therefore, a joint determination is appropriate because of the \nnumber of different law enforcement agencies that may be involved in a particular matter. \n5 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012376 \n13. Section 205 \nD0.1 opposes the addition of the new subsection 240A(b)(6)(A) of the Immigration and \nNationality 21 Act (8 U.S.C. 1229b(b)) unless the word \"Federal\" is added before \"law \nenforcement official.\" The same proposed subsection currently states that the Secretary of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security \"shall grant parole\" to the relatives of trafficking victims. \nDOI. recommends changing this language to read \"may grant parole\" so the Secretary has the \nlatitude to make an appropriate decision. There may be reasons pertaining to the circumstances \nof the relatives of the trafficking victim for which the Secretary should have discretion to deny \nparole. Further, DOJ finds it necessary to strike any reference to \"as a result of the alien's \ncooperation with law enforcement\" for the reasons noted above. \nIn subsection, (6)(B)(ii)(II), DOI opposes a statutory requirement that parole be extended \nduring pending civil actions. As indicated above, this action would create a potential for abuse \nbecause of the lengthy and plaintiff/victim-controlled delays in conducting civil litigation. \n14. Section 211  \nThe Department opposes the change of the \"and\" in subsection (1)(A) to an \"or.\" Both \nthe Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS need to be involved in the certification process. \nThe current certification process is well-established and needs no statutory revisions. DOJ also \nopposes the change in subsection (1)(B), which would remove the Attorney General's authority \nin stating whether a person's presence is necessary in ensuring an effective prosecution. As the \nagency that prosecutes cases of human trafficking, DOrs involvement is vitally important. The \nDepartment has the same concern with the proposed change in subsection (2). \n15. Section 213 \nWe strongly oppose the language in this section that inappropriately removes law \nenforcement from any initial determination of victim status or benefits eligibility. DOJ and DHS \nplay a critical role in protecting the safety of victims and service providers. Any failure to \ninvolve Federal law enforcement immediately upon suspicion that a crime has been committed \ncould threaten the safety of the victim, impeded efforts to promptly rescue victims still in \njeopardy, and possibly man that the offenders avoid apprehension. DOJ recognizes the \nimportant of including HHS at the initial stages for the purpose of facilitating prompt delivery of \nthe full range of available benefits and services to trafficking victims. DOJ will continue to work \nwith DHS and BM to ensure that interagency procedures afford victims of trafficking prompt \nprotection and access to these services. \nThe Department further objects to the provision set forth in paragraph (G), which would \nrequire both Federal and state law enforcement officials to inform the Department of Health and \nHuman Services (HHS) of the existence of a potential victim, but does not require HHS, other \nGovernment officials, or non-governmental service providers to inform Federal or state law \nenforcement of such a victim. To the extent that such a notification procedure must exist, it must \nalso include notification to the Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS, who bear \nresponsibility for prosecuting and investigating instances of human trafficking. \n6 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012377 \nDOJ also opposes subsection (b). Since the passage of the TVPA, DOS has been one of \nthe principal agencies conducting trainings for a multitude of audiences, including task forces \nand Federal, state, and local law enforcement, on the issue of trafficking in persons. The \nDepartment also has experience in conducting training on juvenile victims through the Innocence \nLost National Initiative. Effective efforts to combat trafficking must mobilize the expertise of \nHHS, DHS, and DOJ. \nDOJ also notes a misspelling in the new subsection (F)(ii)— \"edibility\" instead of \n\"eligibility\". \n16. Section 214 \nSection 214 of the bill authorizes the Attorney General to make grants to assist victims of \nsevere forms of trafficking up to $2.5 million in 2008, increasing to $15 million in 2011. The \nDepartment of Justice already has authority to make grants for the provision of services for crime \nvictims and does so at a level in excess of $250 million a year. Also, the authorization of yet \nanother grant program runs counter to the Administration's proposal in the 2008 Budget to \nconsolidate DOJ's more than 70 grant programs. \nMoreover, any provision purporting to expand or alter definitions of individuals of \nqualifying for victim benefits must include the requirement that a Federal law enforcement agent \nmust declare the individual to be a victim of a severe form of trafficking in persons, and that the \nvictim agree to cooperate in the investigation and prosecution, or that the victim be under the age \nof 18. \nDOJ opposes the consultation requirement in subsection (a)(1) with the Secretary of State \nfor establishing programs to serve domestic, U.S. citizen trafficking victims. Such domestic \nauthority falls outside of the mission and expertise of the Department of State. DOJ also opposes \nthe mandatory consultation with non-government organizations (NG0s) regarding the provision \nof services. This creates a conflict of interest since many of the NGOs will apply for and could \nreceive grants under the program. Finally, any section regarding the provision of victim services \nmust also contain language that includes organizations that provide services to \"juveniles \nsubjected to trafficking, as defined in section 203(g) of the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2005,\" which would ensure that the funds authorized to the Attorney \nGeneral for establishment of grants will go toward the work and development of the Innocence \nLost Task Forces. \nDOS opposes subsection (b) because it provides Victims of Crime Act of 1984 funds to \nprostitutes implicated in violations of the Mann Act (criminalizing transportation of prostitutes in \ninterstate commerce). Such persons do not meet the legal defmition of \"victim\" as that term is \ndefined in the law, unless the person prostituted is under the age of 18 at the time the crime was \ncommitted or the person, through the application of another Federal statute or regulation, \nsatisfies the legal definition of a victim. Such persons are already eligible under the Crime \nVictims Fund Act to receive benefits. \n7 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012378 \nDar opposes section 214(d), as it could be construed to require the Attorney General and \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services to make legislative recommendations to Congress in \nviolation of the Recommendations Clause. To avoid this concern, we recommend inserting \", if \nany,\" after \"recommendations\" in section 214(d)(2)(E). Further, DOJ finds subsection (d) \nredundant. A thorough study of services available to domestic and foreign victims was \nconducted by the Senior Policy Operating Group in 2005-2006 and found few statutory \ndifferences between the treatment of domestic and foreign victims. \nSubsection (d)(2)(C) contains a redundant statement. Victims of sex trafficking are \nvictims of severe forms of trafficking in persons. \n17. Section 221  \nIn subsection (a), DOJ opposes the proposed change of MO*g thc içhw!edgc, of \nAgOI0000000#0i010404:03 to:i',14Y.PF*Vir.,01go!, \nThis change of law would \ncreate a strict liability crime, similar to 18 U.S.C. § 2423(a), with similarly severe 10 year \nmandatory minimum sentence. However,16W04004kig44(a)**40#Xa) is exceedingly \n.1iii*KtiiitifitAkt0A0t***.grilgOgogfogoo Therefore, the suggested subsection (a) \nwould create a rare circumstance wherein there is a substantial mandatory minimum sentence for \nan already unusual strict liability crime. Accordingly, this provision is likely to face significant \nlegal challenges. \nDOJ opposes subsection (b) in its entirety, The proposed language is both over-inclusive \nand under-inclusive of human trafficking activities, and the language is vague. Moreover, the \nprovision is unnecessary because section 1589 already prohibits many of these activities when \nthey result in \"serious harm,\" whether physical or emotional, to the victim. \nThe Department opposes subsection (0(1), which would expand the Mann Act to include \ncases \"affecting\" interstate commerce. The Department does not require any additional statutory \nauthority or expanded jurisdiction in order to continue its successful prosecution of human \ntrafficking cases and related criminal conduct.

The Department's \ncurrent efforts with regard to extraterritorial offenses focus on child sex tourism, which are very \ndemanding and resource-intensive cases, requiring gathering evidence abroad, bringing victims \nto the United States to testify, and coordination with foreign law enforcement agencies and \nforeign governments generally, among other matters. Any expansion of authority would be a \ndistraction from those priority cases and would exacerbate existing burdens on investigation and \nprosecution. \nThe Department believes that the addition of 18 U.S.C. § 2423A is unnecessary and that \n18 U.S.C. § 2423 does not need to be amended. \nShould Congress create 18 U.S.C. § 2423A, DOJ believes that language should be \nretained in 18 U.S.C. § 2423(e) that allows the Government to charge attempt or conspiracy for \n18 U.S.C. § 2423(a) crimes. Finally, DOJ notes that the definition of illicit sexual conduct \nneeds to be updated to include production of child pornography. \n18. Section 222 \nAs a general matter, the Department opposes the expansion of jurisdiction over offenses \ninvolving non-American offenders or victims that are committed outside the United States. The \nexpansion ofjurisdietion in this section would place an enormous strain on available resources. \nIn addition, this new section's jurisdiction description overlaps with 18 U.S.C. § 3271. Should \nthe choice be made to keep the jurisdictional provisions provided for in this section, perhaps it \nwould be more effective to expand section 3271. \n19. Section 223 \nThese provisions are not directly related to trafficking. As this section is related to aliens \nbrought into the country for the purposes of prostitution, without a showing of force, fraud, or \ncoercion, and the International Marriage Brokers Act (IMBRA), this bill is not the vehicle for \nthis language. Furthermore, subsection (a)(1) removes the requirement from section 278 of the \nImmigration and Nationality Act that such conduct be done in furtherance of the importation of \nthe alien. By removing this requirement, the bill extends the statute to cover all instances of \n\"pimping\" an alien. \n9 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012380 \n20. Section 224 \nThis section misunderstands the purpose and effect of the model law and should be \ndeleted. The Department's model law was never designed to supplant pre-existing state laws \nwhich target pimping, pandering, or prostitution, but rather to supplement those laws. At the \ntime that the Department's model law was issued, most states had comprehensive laws \naddressing prostitution, pimping, and pandering. However, most states did not have laws \nfocused on human trafficking. The Department's law was designed to raise awareness of the \nissue of trafficking and to encourage states to closely examine cases to ensure that cases \ninvolving fraud, force, and coercion are not labeled as prostitution offenses. The Department \nbelieves the law has been successful in accomplishing this goal. \n2L Section 231 \nThe Department opposes any statutory changes to the annual report. The change in \nsubsection (1) is unnecessary as this language is currently included in the annual report. The \ninformation requested in the new subsection (I) would be excessively burdensome to gather. \n22. Section 232 \nDOJ opposes this addition as unnecessary. Human trafficking laws that do not require \nthe proof of force, fraud, or coercion, namely laws that concern minor victims of severe forms of \nhuman trafficking, are already discussed at the annual conferences. To the extent that this \nprovision would require the Department to discuss human trafficking laws pertaining to adult \nvictims that do not require the showing of force, fraud, or coercion, such laws would not fail \nunder the definition of human trafficking and the annual conference would be an inappropriate \nvenue for the discussion of such laws. However, DOJ trafficking prosecutors utilize a wide \nrange of statutes in addition to Chapter 77 offenses to address all criminal conduct associated \nwith human trafficking. This includes the Mann Act, money laundering, visa fraud, immigration \noffenses, criminal labor violations, and extortion, in addition to other criminal statutes. \nAccordingly, DOJ training at annual conferences, the National Advocacy Center, the National \nCenter for Missing and Exploited Children, and field training with the Department of Justice \nfunded Human Trafficking Task Forces and provided through the Innocence Lost National \nInitiative include discussion on the importance of using all available criminal statutes as essential \ntools in charging decisions. Thus, this section is unnecessary. \n23. Section 233 \nDOJ opposes the change to section 206 of the Trafficking Victims Protection \nReauthorization Act of 2005, which would remove the discretion of agencies in informing the \nSenior Policy Operating Group (SPOG) of grants. Such a change could be read as giving the \nSPOG oversight authority over grants. It also fails to take into consideration situations where \ngrant-making agencies may be unable to notify the SPOG of the grant. \n10 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012381 \n24. Section 234 \nThe Department opposes subsection (a) as an excessively burdensome and unnecessary \ncreation of a new layer of bureaucracy within our agency. The Department does not believe \nthat there is currently any lack of coordination, and a new position could lead to duplication of \nefforts. Furthermore, subsection (a)(2)(A) incorrectly lists the Civil Division and not the Civil \nRights Division. \n25. Section 236 \nIn subsection (a), DOJ questions the reliability of the congressional findings, especially \nwith respect to the estimated number of victims and the inference that the lack of child victims is \ndirectly related to a lack of education individuals who may come into contact with human \ntrafficking victims. Such findings, without a full body of evidence, are counter-productive. \nThe Department also opposes subsection (b). The Attorney General should be involved \nin any program that focuses on combating child trafficking at the border. We propose that \nsection (b)(1) is amended to read \"The Secretary of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the \nSecretary of State, Attorney General, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services.\" Further, \nmost of the children interdicted at the border are used for smuggling and are not trafficking \nvictims, In subsection (b)(5)(D), DOJ believes that the proceedings for removal to non-\ncontiguous countries are problematic because DHS needs more flexibility to handle gang \nmembers, terrorists, repeat offenders, and state offenders. Furthermore, the terrorism exception \nprovided is too narrow to protect the national security interests of the country. \nWe oppose subsection (c)(1) to the extent that it limits the Administration's ability to \ndetermine the best arrangement for custody or various classes of UACs. The administration will \nwork with DHS, DOJ, and MIS to refme and modify current detention practices where \nnecessary. The interagency process is the best forum to consider the various interests of \nunaccompanied minors and law enforcement and to develop and adapt policies that, among other \nthings, provide for the safety of all concerned. We look forward to discussing these \ndevelopments with Congress in the future. \nThe Department opposes subsection (d)(2) as too narrowly construed. There are \nnumerous reasons, outside of the child proving to be a danger to himself or others, that require \nchildren to be kept in a secure facility, including the safety of the child from danger that is not \nself-imposed. In addition, the standard for placing minors in \"secure\" care is too strict. It \nrequires the \"least restrictive setting that is in the best interest of the child.\" HE-IS only places 1.4 \npercent of minors in its care into a \"secure\" custody arrangement. This could mean that minors \nwho need this arrangement would instead be housed with children who have no history of \nviolence or criminal behavior. HHS needs more flexibility and there should not, therefore, be \nrequired to make an \"independent finding\" of the child's danger to self or others. \nDOJ opposes the language of subsection (d)(3Xc) that would afford HHS access to law \nenforcement sensitive databases. \n11 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012382 \nThe language of subsection (d)(5) must be changed from \"shall ensure.\" This implies a \nlegal obligation on the Federal government to provide counsel and a concomitant right on behalf \nof victims to government-funded counsel, which is inappropriate and would subject the \ngovernment to litigation over the nature and scope of the purported obligation and right. \nThe Department also opposes subsection (d)(6), which creates a guardian ad 'item \nprogram. Such program raises serious conflict of interest concerns, and DOJ has opposed similar \nlanguage in the past. Establishment of a guardian ad [item program is also unnecessary in that 18 \nU.S.C. §3509(h) already sets forth detailed procedures which provide for court appointed \nguardians ad litem for children who are victims of or witnesses to crimes involving abuse or \nexploitation. \nSubsection (d)(7) may result in unintended consequences due to this confidentiality \nsection. To effectively combat trafficking, relevant information must be transmitted to law \nenforcement. Law enforcement is well-equipped to preserve confidentiality concerns, \nThe Department believes that subsection (e) undermines the 1997 Special Immigrant \nJuvenile reforms and opposes turning this back over to the states, where it was inherently flawed. \nIn section 236(j), the effect of the apparent retroactivity of the general applicability of \nthese amendments to \"all aliens in the United States before, on, or after the date of enactment of \nthis Act\" raises serious concerns about the provision of benefits and services and has the \npotential to create serious problems for the Department in its implementation of the programs \ndescribed in this section. \n26. Section 301 \nDOJ recommends striking the 2 percent cap on funding for training and technical \nassistance that is in 22 U.S.C. 7105(b)(2)(B). The unique.complexity of the trafficking issue and \nthe level of coordination necessary to effectively serve trafficking victims requires much more \ntraining and technical assistance than a typical OP program. Striking the cap on training and \ntechnical assistance will allow OJP to better allocate the trafficking funds it receives. The \nchange could be implemented by the following statutory language: \n\"Paragraph 107(b)(2)(B)of Pub. L. 106-386 is amended by: \n\"(I) inserting 'and' after the first semicolon; \n\"(2) striking '(ii)' through ';and'; and \n\"(3) striking 'OW and inserting `(ii).\" \n27. Section 302 \nSection 302 re-authorizes the $5,000,000 appropriation for the Pilot Program that was \nfirst authorized by Section 203 of the 2005 version of this Act. The 2007 version, therefore, \nshould add language amending section 203 of the 2005 version to provide that HHS does not \nhave the exclusive authority for development of the pilot program. DOJ and DES must be \nincluded in the development of this program to ensure that the ability of Federal prosecutors and \n12 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012383 \nlaw enforcement to gain access to these victims is not negatively impacted. Moreover, the \nDepartments' knowledge about these victims, their behaviors, and the dangers that are inherent \nin providing shelter and services to them would be instrumental to ensuring the success of the \npilot program. This section should also amend subsection 203(a) of the 2005 reauthorization to \ninclude after \"Secretary of Health and Human Services\", \"in collaboration with the Attorney \nGeneral and the Secretary of Homeland Security,\" Subsection 203(c) should be likewise \namended. \nThe Office of Management and Budget has advised that there is no objection to the \npresentation of this letter from the standpoint of the Administration's programs. \nSincerely, \n4.2 \nBrian A.

MIICVA \nCOUNSEL TO THE PRESIDENT \nI have reflected further on the difficult questions surrounding a President's decision to decline to \nexecute statutory provisions that the President believes are unconstitutional, and I have a few thoughts \nto share with you. Let me start with a general proposition that I believe to be uncontroversial: there are \ncircumstances in which the President may appropriately decline to enforce a statute that he views as \nunconstitutional. \nFirst, there is significant judicial approval of this proposition. Most notable is the Court's decision \nin Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). There the Court sustained the President's view that the \nstatute at issue was unconstitutional without any member of the Court suggesting that the President had \nacted improperly in refusing to abide by the statute. More recently, in Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 \nU.S. 868 (1991), all four of the Justices who addressed the issue agreed that the President has \"the \npower to veto encroaching laws . . . or even to disregard them when they are unconstitutional.\" Id. at \n906 (Scalia, J., concurring); see also Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer, 343 U.S. 579, 635-38 \n(1952) (Jackson, J., concurring) (recognizing existence of President's authority to act contrary to a \nstatutory command). \nSecond, consistent and substantial executive practice also confirms this general proposition. \nOpinions dating to at least 1860 assert the President's authority to decline to effectuate enactments that \nthe President views as unconstitutional. See, e.g., Memorial of Captain Meigs, 9 Op. Att'y Gen. 462, \n469-70 (1860) (asserting that the President need not enforce a statute purporting to appoint an officer); \nsee also annotations of attached Attorney General and Office of Legal Counsel opinions. Moreover, as \nwe discuss more fully below, numerous Presidents have provided advance notice of their intention not \nto enforce specific statutory requirements that they have viewed as unconstitutional, and the Supreme \nCourt has implicitly endorsed this practice. See INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 942 n.13 (1983) (noting \nthat Presidents often sign legislation containing constitutionally objectionable provisions and indicate \nthat they will not comply with those provisions). \nWhile the general proposition that in some situations the President may decline to enforce \nunconstitutional statutes is unassailable, it does not offer sufficient guidance as to the appropriate \ncourse in specific circumstances. To continue our conversation about these complex issues, I offer the \nfollowing propositions for your consideration. \n1. The President's office and authority are created and bounded by the Constitution; he is required to \nact within its terms. Put somewhat differently, in serving as the executive created by the Constitution, \nthe President is required to act in accordance with the laws -- including the Constitution, which takes \nprecedence over other forms of law. This obligation is reflected in the Take Care Clause and in the \nPresident's oath of office. \n2. When bills are under consideration by Congress, the executive branch should promptly identify \nunconstitutional provisions and communicate its concerns to Congress so that the provisions can be \ncorrected. Although this may seem elementary, in practice there have been occasions in which the \nPresident has been presented with enrolled bills containing constitutional flaws that should have been \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012386 \ncorrected in the legislative process. \n3. The President should presume that enactments are constitutional. There will be some occasions, \nhowever, when a statute appears to conflict with the Constitution. In such cases, the President can and \nshould exercise his independent judgment to determine whether the statute is constitutional. In \nreaching a conclusion, the President should give great deference to the fact that Congress passed the \nstatute and that Congress believed it was upholding its obligation to enact constitutional legislation. \nWhere possible, the President should construe provisions to avoid constitutional problems. \n4. The Supreme Court plays a special role in resolving disputes about the constitutionality of \nenactments. As a general matter, if the President believes that the Court would sustain a particular \nprovision as constitutional, the President should execute the statute, notwithstanding his own beliefs \nabout the constitutional issue. If, however, the President, exercising his independent judgment, \ndetermines both that a provision would violate the Constitution and that it is probable that the Court \nwould agree with him, the President has the authority to decline to execute the statute. \n5. Where the President's independent constitutional judgment and his determination of the Court's \nprobable decision converge on a conclusion of unconstitutionality, the President must make a decision \nabout whether or not to comply with the provision. That decision is necessarily specific to context, and \nit should be reached after careful weighing of the effect of compliance with the provision on the \nconstitutional rights of affected individuals and on the executive branch's constitutional authority. Also \nrelevant is the likelihood that compliance or non-compliance will permit judicial resolution of the \nissue. That is, the President may base his decision to comply (or decline to comply) in part on a desire \nto afford the Supreme Court an opportunity to review the constitutional judgment of the legislative \nbranch. \n6. The President has enhanced responsibility to resist unconstitutional provisions that encroach upon \nthe constitutional powers of the Presidency. Where the President believes that an enactment \nunconstitutionally limits his powers, he has the authority to defend his office and decline to abide by it, \nunless he is convinced that the Court would disagree with his assessment. If the President does not \nchallenge such provisions (i.e., by refusing to execute them), there often will be no occasion for \njudicial consideration of their constitutionality; a policy of consistent Presidential enforcement of \nstatutes limiting his power thus would deny the Supreme Court the opportunity to review the \nlimitations and thereby would allow for unconstitutional restrictions on the President's authority. \nSome legislative encroachments on executive authority, however, will not be justiciable or are for \nother reasons unlikely to be resolved in court. If resolution in the courts is unlikely and the President \ncannot look to a judicial determination, he must shoulder the responsibility of protecting the \nconstitutional role of the presidency. This is usually true, for example, of provisions limiting the \nPresident's authority as Commander in Chief. Where it is not possible to construe such provisions \nconstitutionally, the President has the authority to act on his understanding of the Constitution. \nOne example of a Presidential challenge to a statute encroaching upon his powers that did result in \nlitigation was Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926). In that case, President Wilson had defied a \nstatute that prevented him from removing postmasters without Senate approval; the Supreme Court \nultimately struck down the statute as an unconstitutional limitation on the President's removal power. \nMyers is particularly instructive because, at the time President Wilson acted, there was no Supreme \nCourt precedent on point and the statute was not manifestly unconstitutional. In fact, the \nconstitutionality of restrictions on the President's authority to remove executive branch officials had \nbeen debated since the passage of the Tenure of Office Act in 1867 over President Johnson's veto. The \ncloseness of the question was underscored by the fact that three Justices, including Justices Holmes and \nBrandeis, dissented in Myers. Yet, despite the unsettled constitutionality of President Wilson's action, \nno member of the Court in Myers suggested that Wilson overstepped his constitutional authority -- or \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012387 \neven acted improperly -- by refusing to comply with a statute he believed was unconstitutional. The \nCourt in Myers can be seen to have implicitly vindicated the view that the President may refuse to \ncomply with a statute that limits his constitutional powers if he believes it is unconstitutional. As \nAttorney General Civiletti stated in a 1980 opinion, \nMyers is very nearly decisive of the issue [of Presidential denial of the validity of statutes]. \nMyers holds that the President's constitutional duty does not require him to execute \nunconstitutional statutes; nor does it require him to execute them provisionally, against the \nday that they are declared unconstitutional by the courts. He cannot be required by statute \nto retain postmasters against his will unless and until a court says that he may lawfully let \nthem go. If the statute is unconstitutional, it is unconstitutional from the start. \nThe Attorney General's Duty to Defend and Enforce Constitutionally Objectionable Legislation, 4A \nOp. O.L.C. 55, 59 (1980). \n7. The fact that a sitting President signed the statute in question does not change this analysis. The \ntext of the Constitution offers no basis for distinguishing bills based on who signed them; there is no \nconstitutional analogue to the principles of waiver and estoppel. Moreover, every President since \nEisenhower has issued signing statements in which he stated that he would refuse to execute \nunconstitutional provisions. See annotations of attached signing statements. As we noted in our \nmemorandum on Presidential signing statements, the President \"may properly announce to Congress \nand to the public that he will not enforce a provision of an enactment he is signing. If so, then a signing \nstatement that challenges what the President determines to be an unconstitutional encroachment on his \npower, or that announces the President's unwillingness to enforce (or willingness to litigate) such a \nprovision, can be a valid and reasonable exercise of Presidential authority.\" Memorandum for Bernard \nN. Nussbaum, Counsel to the President, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant Attorney General, Office of \nLegal Counsel at 4 (Nov. 3, 1993). (Of course, the President is not obligated to announce his \nreservations in a signing statement; he can convey his views in the time, manner, and form of his \nchoosing.) Finally, the Supreme Court recognized this practice in INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983): \nthe Court stated that \"it is not uncommon for Presidents to approve legislation containing parts which \nare objectionable on constitutional grounds\" and then cited the example of President Franklin \nRoosevelt's memorandum to Attorney General Jackson, in which he indicated his intention not to \nimplement an unconstitutional provision in a statute that he had just signed. Id. at 942 n.13. These \nsources suggest that the President's signing of a bill does not affect his authority to decline to enforce \nconstitutionally objectionable provisions thereof. \n• In accordance with these propositions, we do not believe that a President is limited to choosing \nbetween vetoing, for example, the Defense Appropriations Act and executing an unconstitutional \nprovision in it. In our view, the President has the authority to sign legislation containing desirable \nelements while refusing to execute a constitutionally defective provision. \nWe recognize that these issues are difficult ones. When the President's obligation to act in accord \nwith the Constitution appears to be in tension with his duty to execute laws enacted by Congress, \nquestions are raised that go to the heart of our constitutional structure. In these circumstances, a \nPresident should proceed with caution and with respect for the obligation that each of the branches \nshares for the maintenance of constitutional government. \nWalter Dellinger \nAssistant Attorney General \nBrief Description of Attached Materials \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012388 \nAttorney General Opinions \n1) Memorial of Captain Meigs, 9 Op. Atry Gen. 462 (1860): In this opinion the Attorney General \nconcluded that the President is permitted to disregard an unconstitutional statute. Specifically, Attorney \nGeneral Black concluded that a statute purporting to appoint an officer should not be enforced: \"Every \nlaw is to be carried out so far forth as is consistent with the Constitution, and no further. The sound part \nof it must be executed, and the vicious portion of it suffered to drop.\" Id. at 469. \n2) Constitutionality of Congress' Disapproval of Agency Regulations by Resolutions Not Presented to  \nthe President, 4A Op. O.L.C. 21 (1980): In this opinion Attorney General Civiletti instructed Secretary \nof Education Hufstedler that she was authorized to implement regulations that had been disapproved by \nconcurrent congressional resolutions, pursuant to a statutory legislative veto. The Attorney General• \nnoted that \"the Attorney General must scrutinize with caution any claim that he or any other executive \nofficer may decline to defend or enforce a statute whose constitutionality is merely in doubt.\" Id. at 29. \nHe concluded, however, that \"[t]o regard these concurrent resolutions as legally binding would impair \nthe Executive's constitutional role and might well foreclose effective judicial challenge to their \nconstitutionality. More important, I believe that your recognition of these concurrent resolutions as \nlegally binding would constitute an abdication of the responsibility of the executive branch, as an equal \nand coordinate branch of government with the legislative branch, to preserve the integrity of its \nfunctions against constitutional encroachment.\" Id. \n3) The Attorney General's Duty to Defend and Enforce Constitutionally Objectionable Legislation, 4A \nOp. O.L.C. 55 (1980): Attorney General Civiletti, in answer to a congressional inquiry, observed that \n\"Myers holds that the President's constitutional duty does not require him to execute unconstitutional \nstatutes; nor does it require him to execute them provisionally, against the day that they are declared \nunconstitutional by the courts.\" Id. at 59. He added as a cautionary note that \"[t]he President has no \n'dispensing power,\" meaning that the President and his subordinates \"may not lawfully defy an Act of \nCongress if the Act is constitutional. . . . In those rare instances in which the Executive may lawfully \nact in contravention of a statute, it is the Constitution that dispenses with the operation of the statute. \nThe Executive cannot.\" Id. at 59-60. \n4) Letter from William French Smith, Attorney General, to Peter W. Rodino, Jr., Chairman, House  \nJudiciary Committee (Feb. 22 1985): This letter discussed the legal precedent and authority for the \nPresident's refusal to execute a provision of the Competition in Contracting Act. The Attorney General \nnoted that the decision \"not to implement the disputed provisions has the beneficial byproduct of \nincreasing the likelihood of a prompt judicial resolution. Thus, far from unilaterally nullifying an Act \nof Congress, the Department's actions are fully consistent with the allocation of judicial power by the \nConstitution to the courts.\" Id. at 8. The letter also stated that \"the President's failure to veto a measure \ndoes not prevent him subsequently from challenging the Act in court, nor does presidential approval of \nan enactment cure constitutional defects.\" Id. at 3. \nOffice of Legal Counsel Opinions \n1) Memorandum to the Honorable Robert J. Lipshutz, Counsel to the President, from John M.  \nHarmon, Assistant Attorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (Sept. 27, 1977): This opinion \nconcluded that the President may lawfully disregard a statute that he interprets to be unconstitutional. \nWe asserted that \"cases may arise in which the unconstitutionality of the relevant statute will be \ncertain, and in such a case the Executive could decline to enforce the statute for that reason alone.\" Id. \nat 13. We continued, stating that \"[u]nless the unconstitutionality of a statute is clear, the President \nshould attempt to resolve his doubts in a way that favors the statute, and he should not decline to \nenforce it unless he concludes that he is compelled to do so under the circumstances.\" Id. We declined \nto catalogue all the considerations that would weigh in favor of non-enforcement, but we identified \ntwo: first the extent of the harm to individuals or the government resulting from enforcement; and, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012389 \nsecond, the creation of an opportunity for a court challenge through non-enforcement (e.g., Myers). \n2) Appropriations Limitation for Rules Vetoed by Congress, 4B Op. 0.L.C. 731 (1980): In this \nopinion we rejected the constitutionality of a proposed legislative veto, prior to the Court's decision in \nChadha. We opined that \"[t]o regard this provision as legally binding would impair the Executive's \nconstitutional role and would constitute an abdication of the responsibility of the Executive Branch.\" \nId. at 734. It should be noted that the legislation in question was pending in Congress, and the \npossibility that President Carter would sign the legislation did not affect our analysis of the \nconstitutional issue. We simply stated that, \"if enacted, the [legislative veto provision] will not have \nany legal effect.\" Id. \n3) Issues Raised by Section 102(c)(2) of H.R. 3792, 14 Op. O.L.C. 38 (1990) (preliminary print): This \nopinion also addressed then-pending legislation, in this case the foreign relations authorization bill for \nfiscal years 1990 and 1991. The opinion found that a provision of the bill was unconstitutional and \nseverable. Regarding non-execution, the opinion stated that \"at least in the context of legislation that \ninfringes the separation of powers, the President has the constitutional authority to refuse to enforce \nunconstitutional laws.\" Id. at 53. The opinion concluded that \"if the President chooses to sign H.R. \n3792, he would be constitutionally authorized to decline to enforce\" the constitutionally objectionable \nsection. Id. at 38. \n4) Issues Raised by Section 129 of Pub. L. No. 102-138 and Section 503 of Pub. L. No. 102-140, 16  \nOp. O.L.C. 18 (1992) (preliminary print): This opinion concluded that two statutory provisions that \nlimited the issuance of official and diplomatic passports were unconstitutional and were severable from \nthe remainder of the two statutes. On the question of non-execution, the opinion rejected \"the argument \nthat the President may not treat a statute as invalid prior to a judicial determination.\" Id. at 40. The \nopinion concluded that the Constitution authorizes the President to refuse to enforce a law that he \nbelieves is unconstitutional. \n5) Memorandum for Bernard N. Nussbaum, Counsel to the President, from Walter Dellinger, Assistant \nAttorney General, Office of Legal Counsel (Nov. 3, 1993): This opinion discusses different categories \nof signing statements, including those construing bills to avoid constitutional problems and those in \nwhich the President declares \"that a provision of the bill before him is flatly unconstitutional, and that \nhe will refuse to enforce it.\" Id. at 3. The opinion concludes that such \"uses of Presidential signing \nstatements generally serve legitimate and defensible purposes.\" Id. at 7. \nPresidential Signing Statements \n1) Statement by the State Department (Announcing President Wilson's Refusal to Carry Out the  \nSection of the Jones Merchant Marine Act of June 5, 1920, directing him to terminate treaty provisions \nrestricting the Government's right to impose discriminatory tonnage dues and tariff duties), 17 A  \nCompilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents 8871 (Sept. 24, 1920) (Pres. Wilson): The \nState Department announced that it \"has been informed by the President that he does not deem the \ndirection contained in Section 34 of the so-called Merchant Marine Act an exercise of any \nconstitutional power possessed by the Congress.\" Id. The statement also defended President Wilson's \ndecision to sign the bill and noted that \"the fact that one section of the law involves elements of \nillegality rendering the section inoperative need not affect the validity and operation of the Act as a \nwhole.\" 5 Green Haywood Hackworth, Digest of International Law 324 (1943). \n2) Special Message to the Congress Upon Signing the Department of Defense Appropriation Act, Pub.  \nPapers of Dwight D. Eisenhower 688 (July 13, 1955): President Eisenhower, in signing a bill (H.R. \n6042) that contained a legislative veto, stated that the legislative veto \"will be regarded as invalid by \nthe executive branch of the Government in the administration of H.R. 6042, unless otherwise \ndetermined by a court of competent jurisdiction.\" Id. at 689. - \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012390 \n3) Memorandum on Informing Congressional Committees of Changes Involving Foreign Economic  \nAssistance Funds, Pub. Papers of John F. Kennedy 6 (Jan. 9, 1963): President Kennedy stated that a \nprovision in the bill he was signing contained an unconstitutional legislative veto. He announced that \n\"[i]t is therefore my intention . . . to treat this provision as a request for information.\" Id. \n4) Statement by the President Upon Approving the Public Works Appropriations Act, Pub. Papers of \nLyndon B. Johnson 104 (Dec. 31, 1963): President Johnson also found that a legislative veto provision \nwas unconstitutional and stated that he would treat it as a request for information. \n5) Statement About Signing the Public Buildings Amendments of 1972, Pub. Papers of Richard Nixon \n686 (June 17, 1972): President Nixon stated that a clause conditioning the use of authority by the \nexecutive branch on the approval of a congressional committee was unconstitutional. He ordered the \nagency involved to comply with \"the acceptable procedures\" in the bill \"without regard to the \nunconstitutional provisions I have previously referred to.\" Id. at 687. \n6) Statement on Signing the Department of Defense Appropriation Act of 1976, Pub. Papers of Gerald  \nR. Ford 241 (Feb. 10, 1976): President Ford stated that a committee approval mechanism was \nunconstitutional and announced that he would \"treat the unconstitutional provision . . . to the extent it \nrequires further Congressional committee approval, as a complete nullity.\" Id. at 242. \n7) Statement on Signing Coastal Zone Management Improvement Act of 1980, Pub. Papers of Jimmy  \nCarter 2335 (Oct. 18, 1980): President Carter stated that a legislative veto provision was \nunconstitutional and that any attempt at a legislative veto would \"not [be] regarded as legally binding.\" \nId. \n8) Statement on Signing the Union Station Redevelopment Act of 1981, Pub. Papers of Ronald  \nReagan 1207 (Dec. 29, 1981): President Reagan stated that a legislative veto was unconstitutional and \nannounced that \"[t]he Secretary of Transportation will not . . . regard himself as legally bound by any \nsuch resolution.\" Id. \n9) Statement On Signing the National and Community Service Act of 1990, Pub. Papers of George  \nBush 1613 (Nov. 16, 1990): President Bush rejected the constitutionality of provisions that required a \nPresidentially appointed board exercising executive authority to include, among its 21 members, \n\"seven members nominated by the Speaker of the House of Representatives . .. [and] seven members \nnominated by the Majority Leader of the Senate.\" Id. at 1614. He announced that the restrictions on his \nchoice of nominees to the board \"are without legal force or effect.\" Id. \n10) 7 A Compilation of the Messages and Papers of the Presidents 377 (Aug. 14, 1876) (Pres. Grant): \nThis is one of the earliest of many instances of a President \"construing\" a provision (to avoid \nconstitutional problems) in a way that seems to amount to a refusal to enforce a provision of it. An \n1876 statute directed that notices be sent to certain diplomatic and consular officers \"to close their \noffices.\" President Grant, in signing the bill, stated that, \"[i]n the literal sense of this direction it would \nbe an invasion of the constitutional prerogatives and duty of the Executive.\" Id. In order to avoid this \nproblem, President Grant \"constru[edr this provision \"only to exercise the constitutional prerogative of \nCongress over the expenditures of the Government,\" not to \"imply[] a right in the legislative branch to \ndirect the closing or discontinuing of any of the diplomatic or consular offices of the Government.\" Id. \nat 378. \nOther Presidential Documents \n1) A Presidential Legal Opinion, 66 Harv. L. Rev. 1353 (1953): This was a legal opinion from \nPresident Franklin Roosevelt to Attorney General Jackson. President Roosevelt stated that he was \nsigning the Lend-Lease Act despite a provision providing for a legislative veto, \"a provision which, in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012391 \nmy opinion, is clearly unconstitutional.\" Id. at 1357. The President stated that, \"[i]n order that I may be \non record as indicating my opinion that the foregoing provision of the so-called Lend-Lease Act is \nunconstitutional, and in order that my approval of the bill, due to the existing exigencies of the world \nsituation, may not be construed as a tacit acquiescence in any contrary view, I am requesting you to \nplace this memorandum in the official files of the Department of Justice. I am desirous of having this \ndone for the further reason that I should not wish my action in approving the bill which includes this \ninvalid clause, to be used as a precedent for any future legislation comprising provisions of a similar \nnature.\" Id. at 1358. \n2) Message to the Congress on Legislative Vetoes, Pub. Papers of Jimmy Carter 1146 (Jun. 21, 1978): \nIn this memorandum President Carter expressed his strong opposition to legislative vetoes and stated \nthat \"[t]he inclusion of [a legislative veto] in a bill will be an important factor in my decision to sign or \nto veto it.\" Id. at 1148. He further stated that, \"[a]s for legislative vetoes over the execution of programs \nalready prescribed in legislation and in bills I must sign for other reasons, the Executive Branch will \ngenerally treat them as 'report-and-wait' provisions. In such a case, if Congress subsequently adopts a \nresolution to veto an Executive action, we will give it serious consideration, but we will not, under our \nreading of the Constitution, consider it legally binding.\" Id. at 1149. \nHistorical Materials \n1) Statement of James Wilson on December 1, 1787 on the Adoption of the Federal Constitution,  \nreprinted in 2 Jonathan Elliot, Debates on the Federal Constitution 418 (1836): Wilson argued that the \nConstitution imposed significant -- and sufficient -- restraints on the power of the legislature, and that \nthe President would not be dependent upon the legislature. In this context, he stated that \"the power of \nthe Constitution was paramount to the power of the legislature acting under that Constitution; for it is \npossible that the legislature . . . may transgress the bounds assigned to it, and an act may pass, in the \nusual mode notwithstanding that transgression; but when it comes to be discussed before the judges,--\nwhen they consider its principles, and find it to be incompatible with the superior power of the \nConstitution,-- it is their duty to pronounce it void . . . . In the same manner, the President of the United \nStates could shield himself, and refuse to carry into effect an act that violates the Constitution.\" Id. at \n445-46. \n2) Letter from Chief Justice Chase to Gerrit Smith (Apr. 19, 1868), quoted in J. Schuckers, The Life  \nand Public Services of Salmon Portland Chase 577 (1874): Chase stated that President Johnson took \nthe proper action in removing Secretary of War Stanton without Senate approval, in light of Johnson's \nbelief that the statutory restriction on his removal authority was unconstitutional. In this regard, Chase \ncommented that \"the President had a perfect right, and indeed was under the highest obligation, to \nremove Mr. Stanton, if he made the removal not in wanton disregard of a constitutional law, but with a \nsincere belief that the Tenure-of-Office Act was unconstitutional and for the purpose of bringing the \nquestion before the Supreme Court.\" Id. at 578. \nCongressional Materials \n1) The President's Suspension of the Competition in Contracting Act is Unconstitutional, H.R. Rep.  \nNo. 138, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. (1985): The House Committee on Government Operations concluded \nthat the President lacked the authority to refuse to implement any provision of the Competition in \nContracting Act. The Committee stated that, \"fflo adopt the view that one's oath to support and defend \nthe Constitution is a license to exercise any available power in furtherance of one's own constitutional \ninterpretation would quickly destroy the entire constitutional scheme. Such a view, whereby the \nPresident pledges allegiance to the Constitution but then determines what the Constitution means, \ninexorably leads to the usurpation by the Executive of the others' roles.\" Id. at 11. The Committee also \nstated that \"[t]he Executive's suspension of the law circumvents the constitutionally specified means \nfor expressing Executive objections to law and is a constitutionally impermissible absolute veto \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012392 \npower.\" Id. at 13. \n2) Memorandum from the Congressional Research Service to the Committee on Government \nOperations concerning \"The Executive's Duty to Enforce the Laws\" (Feb. 6, 1985), reprinted in \nConstitutionality of GAO's Bid Protest Function: Hearings Before a Subcomm. of the House Comm.  \non Government Operations, 99th Cong., 1st Sess. 544 (1985): This memorandum stated that the \nPresident lacks the authority to decline to enforce statutes. The CRS argued that \"[t]he refusal of the \nPresident to execute the law is indistinguishable from the power to suspend the laws. That power, as is \ntrue of the power to amend or to revive an expired law, is a legislative power.\" Id. at 554. \nCases (not included in the submitted materials) \n1) Myers v. United States, 272 U.S. 52 (1926): The President refused to comply with -- that is, enforce \n-- a limitation on his power of removal that he regarded as unconstitutional, even though the question \nhad not been addressed by the Supreme Court. A member of Congress, Senator Pepper, urged the \nSupreme Court to uphold the validity of the provision. The Supreme Court vindicated the President's \ninterpretation without any member of the Court indicating that the President had acted unlawfully or \ninappropriately in refusing to enforce the removal restriction based on his belief that it was \nunconstitutional. \n2) United States v. Lovett, 328 U.S. 303 (1946): The President enforced a statute that directed him to \nwithhold compensation from three named employees, even though the President believed the law to be \nunconstitutional. The Justice Department argued against the constitutionality of the statute in the \nensuing litigation. (The Court permitted an attorney to appear on behalf of Congress, amicus curiae, to \ndefend the statute.) \n3) INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919 (1983): This case involved the withholding of citizenship from an \napplicant pursuant to a legislative veto of an Attorney General decision to grant citizenship. Despite a \nCarter Administration policy against complying with legislative vetoes (see Carter Presidential \nmemorandum, supra), the executive branch enforced the legislative veto, and, in so doing, allowed for \njudicial review of the statute. As with Lovett, the Justice Department argued against the \nconstitutionality of the statute. \n4) Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988): The President viewed the independent counsel statute as \nunconstitutional. The Attorney General enforced it, making findings and forwarding them to the \nSpecial Division. In litigation, however, the Justice Department attacked the constitutionality of the \nstatute and left its defense to the Senate Counsel, as amicus curiae, and the independent counsel \nherself. \n5) Freytag v. Commissioner, 501 U.S. 868 (1991): A unanimous Court ruled that the appointment of \nspecial trial judges by the Chief Judge of the United States Tax Court did not violate the Appointments \nClause. Five Justices concluded that the Tax Court was a \"Court of Law\" for Appointments Clause \npurposes, despite the fact that it was an Article I court, so that the Tax Court could constitutionally \nappoint inferior officers. Four Justices, in a concurrence by Justice Scalia, contended that the Tax Court \nwas a \"Department\" under the Appointments Clause. The concurrence stated that \"Court of Law\" did \nnot include Article I courts and that the Framers intended to prevent Congress from having the power \nboth to create offices and to appoint officers. In this regard, the concurrence stated that \"it was not \nenough simply to repose the power to execute the laws (or to appoint) in the President; it was also \nnecessary to provide him with the means to resist legislative encroachment upon that power. The \nmeans selected were various, including a separate political constituency, to which he alone was \nresponsible, and the power to veto encroaching laws, see Art. I, § 7, or even to disregard them when \nthey are unconstitutional.\" Id. at 906 (Scalia, J., concurring). \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012393 \n6) Lear Siegler, Inc., Energy Products Division v. Lehman, 842 F.2d 1102 (9th Cir. 1988), withdrawn  \nin part 893 F.2d 205 (9th Cir. 1990) (en banc): The President refused to comply with provisions of the \nCompetition in Contracting Act that he viewed as unconstitutional and thereby allowed for judicial \nresolution of the issue. The Ninth Circuit rejected the President's arguments about the constitutionality \nof the provisions. The court further determined that Lear Siegler was a prevailing party and was \nentitled to attorneys' fees, because the executive branch acted in bad faith in refusing to execute the \ncontested provisions. In this regard, the court stated that the President's action was \"utterly at odds with \nthe texture and plain language of the Constitution,\" because a statute is part of the law of the land that \nthe President is obligated to execute. Id. at 1121, 1124. On rehearing en banc, the court ruled that Lear \nSiegler was not a prevailing party and withdrew the sections of the opinion quoted above. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012394 \nTAB 13 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012395 \n-0929104.TXT \nIN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF THE FIFTEENTH JUDICIAL CIRCUIT \nIN AND FOR PALM BEACH COUNTY, FLORIDA \nCASE NO. 2006 CF09454AXX \nSTATE OF FLORIDA, \n-vs-\nJEFFREY EPSTEIN, \nDefendant. \nDEPOSITION OF \nWednesday, February 20, 2008 \n2:00 p.m. - 4:30 p.m. \nPalm Beach County Courthouse \n205 North Dixie Highway \nWest Palm Beach, Florida 33401 \nReported By: \nJudith F.

If it is the \n17 only way that you know the answer is through our \n18 discussions, do not answer that question. \n19 THE WITNESS: Okay. \n20 MR. LEOPOLD: Attorney/client privilege. \n21 BY MR.

Other than conversations that you have had \n10 with Mr. Leopold -- I'm not asking about that -- are you \n11 aware that Mr. Leopold has filed a lawsuit in federal \n12 court seeking fifty million dollars from Jeffrey Epstein \n13 on your behalf? \n14 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. \n15 Anything that you learn through \n16 conversations between you and me, do not answer. \n17 Those are protected. If you know through any \n18 other realm of knowledge, you may answer. \n19 THE WITNESS: No. \n20 BY MR. TEIN: \n21 Q. You have no idea that Mr. Leopold filed a \n22 fifty million-dollar lawsuit on your behalf against \n23 Jeffrey Epstein? \n24 MR. LEOPOLD: Same objection. \n25 Do not answer that question if it's through \n10 \n1 discussions that you and I had. Outside of that, \n2 you may answer. So do not answer that question if \n3 that is the only basis by which you understand \n4 that answer. \n5 THE WITNESS: No. \n6 BY MR. TEIN: \n7 Q. You didn't know that? \n8 MR.

If you know it \n12 through any other realm, you may answer. \n13 MR. TEIN: Are you going to say that for \nPage 8 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012403 \n-0929104.TXT \n14 every question in the deposition, Mr. Leopold? \n15 MR. LEOPOLD: When you ask improper \n16 questions like that without the proper --\n17 MR. TEIN: You're going to stop your \n18 speaking objections right now. Okay? \n19 MR. LEOPOLD: Without the proper --\n20 MR. TEIN: You need to stop your speaking \n21 objections. \n22 Let's continue. \n23 MR. LEOPOLD: Counsel, you just asked me a \n24 question and I'm going to state it on the \n25 record --\n11 \n1 MR. TEIN: You need to stop your speaking \n2 objections. Check your rules. \n3 MR. LEOPOLD: Excuse me. For the record, \n4 Counsel asked me a question. I'll state the \n5 answer on the record. He asked me the question am \n6 I going to be answering that way throughout the \n7 deposition. So long as there's improper \n8 foundation and predicate asked by the attorney, I \n9 will protect my client and I make the record where \n10 appropriate. If counsel wishes to ask an \n11 appropriate worded question with the proper \n12 foundation and predicate, I will certainly allow \n13 the client to answer the question. \n14 MR. GOLDBERGER: Why don't you just state \n15 attorney/client privilege and just be done with \n16 it. \n17 MR. LEOPOLD: I want the record to be \nPage 9 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012404 \n-0929104.TXT \n18 clear. \n19 MR. TEIN: You want to waste time is what \n20 you want to do. You were supposed to be here this \n21 morning and you totally broke the deal, the \n22 agreement that you had with us if your hearing got \n23 cancelled. \n24 But let's move on and maybe you'll stop \n25 obstructing this deposition. \n12 \n1 MR. LEOPOLD: I think the record is very \n2 clear where we stand thus far. \n3 Is there a recording taken of this \n4 deposition? \n5 THE COURT REPORTER: Yes. \n6 MR. LEOPOLD: Just make sure that's \n7 preserved. \n8 BY MR. TEIN: \n9 Q. Go to Exhibit 20-01 -- well, before you do \n10 that, , are you aware that a lawyer named Jeffrey \n11 Herman filed a lawsuit on your behalf, yes or no? \n12 MR. LEOPOLD: Objection. \n13 Any conversations that you and I have had \n14 regarding that, if that is the only way by which \n15 you understand how to answer that question, so not \n16 answer. It's attorney/client privilege, as well \n17 as any conversations you may have had with the \n18 attorney from Miami. That is also attorney/client \n19 privilege. And I'm assuming --\n20 MR. TEIN: You're actually wrong about the \n21 attorney/client privilege. \n22 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm assuming Counsel is not \nPage 10 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012405 \n-0929104.TXT \n23 asking you to divulge attorney/client --\n24 MR. TEIN: Of course not. \n25 BY MR.

TEIN: Just say attorney/client \n9 privilege. Stop interrupting my questions. \n10 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm entitled to make an \n11 objection for the record, which I'm doing, and \n12 I'll make the same objection.

I work at and people \n10 were telling me that people were looking for me. So yes, \n11 I was aware that people were searching for me, but I had \n12 no idea who they were or what their intentions were, but \n13 I thought they were just people I didn't want to talk to. \n14 So I just didn't want to talk to them. And every time \n15 they'd come to work I wasn't there. And so happens the \n16 night that they came in me and my friend switched name \n17 tags. No big deal. \n18 Q. That's a lie, isn't it? \n19 MR.

But \n20 I'm not going to allow her to answer, nor be \n21 harassed by him. It's improper. \n22 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. But your response \n23 that Counsel doesn't like the question -- or \n24 doesn't like the answer -- just let me finish. \n25 MR. LEOPOLD: Absolutely. I wasn't going \n60 \n1 to interrupt you. \n2 MR.

But I'm not \n12 going to allow her to answer that question because \n13 she's answered that same question and has \n14 explained it. \n15 Now Counsel might be sitting there rubbing \n16 his head with a migraine.

GOLDBERGER: Done. \n2 MR. LEOPOLD: That's if you agree to that. \n3 If not, then I want to pull each one out and put \n4 exhibit labels on them, which we should do before \n5 we leave. \n6 MR. GOLDBERGER: We're not going to do \n7 either. I'll have copies sent to the court \n8 reporter and she can attach them to the \n9 deposition. \n10 MR. LEOPOLD: So you're not going to agree \n11 to what we talked about during the break then. \n12 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'm not quite sure what \n13 your asking me to do. Let me finish. \n14 MR. LEOPOLD: Okay. Sure. That's fine. \n15 MR. GOLDBERGER: Okay. If you want me to \n16 go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office and make copies \n17 and then I'll give those to the court reporter, \nPage 105 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012500 \n-0929104.TXT \n18 fine. All I'm saying is that I would avoid that \n19 process. I would send copies to the court \n20 reporter. But if it will make you happier \n21 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not? \n22 MR. GOLDBERGER: Let me finish. \n23 MR. LEOPOLD: I'm not interrupting now. \n24 MR. GOLDBERGER: But if it will make you \n25 happier if I go over to Ms. Belohlavek's office \n124 \n1 and make a copy of those photos that were part of \n2 this deposition and then I'll give them to the \n3 court reporter, I'll be happy to do it. \n4 MR. LEOPOLD: I trust you implicitly, \n5 however you with to do it. However, the \n6 documents, before they leave this room, need to \n7 have an exhibit sticky on them with the \n8 appropriate --\n9 MR. GOLDBERGER: Want to go get some? We \n10 don't have any. \n11 MR. LEOPOLD: I will do that. Excuse me. \n12 Let me finish the record, please. You can't do \n13 that to the court reporter. She's going to stroke \n14 out. You can't do that. You have to let me --\n15 MR. TEIN: Finish your sentence, Ted. You \n16 are the most long-winded lawyer I've ever seen in \n17 my life. Finish your sentence. \n18 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, tell him not to raise \n19 his voice, please. \n20 MR. TEIN: Finish your sentence. Is there \n21 going to be a period at the end of the sentence or \n22 is it just going to be comma after comma after \nPage 106 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012501 \n-0929104.TXT \n23 comma? \n24 Go ahead, lawyer. \n25 MR. LEOPOLD: All right. The exhibits, I \n125 \n1 can't prevent you from taking them, but I will \n2 object and I will be bringing it to the court for \n3 sanctions. You cannot take the exhibits out of \n4 the room without them being marked. I want them \n5 marked, because you cannot identify in the record \n6 what was used. And with all due respect to \n7 Mr. Goldberger, I do not -- the way this \n8 deposition is going, I do not want to rely on \n9 Counsel from Miami to mark the appropriate \n10 exhibits. I will not do that. I cannot prevent \n11 you from taking them. But if you do, I will be \n12 bringing the matter to the court with appropriate \n13 sanctions, because that is improper. That is \n14 improper. When you use something in a deposition, \n15 they are to be marked. And you have refused to do \n16 that throughout for what ever reason. \n17 MR TEIN: You're wrong. Finish your \n18 sentence because you're talking about something \n19 you have no idea. \n20 Every single one is marked, Ted. Every \n21 single one is already marked. But you want to \n22 argue about everything. Ever single one is \n23 already marked. Isn't that silly, Ted? \n24 MR. GOLDBERGER: Thirty years of doing this \n25 and I have never had an argument over this. \nPage 107 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012502 \n-0929104.TXT \n126 \n1 MR. TEIN: You've made -- Ted, you are \n2 obstructionist, you are a liar. You have lied and \n3 misrepresented things, for the record. You are \n4 grandstanding. \n5 MR. LEOPOLD: You need to back up. \n6 MR. TEIN: No, no. I'm going to finish. \n7 MR. LEOPOLD: You can finish, but don't \n8 hover over me. \n9 MR. TEIN: No one is hovering over you. \n10 Stop trying to make a lying record. \n11 Let me say something else. \n12 Don't you dare threaten me with sanctions, \n13 after you lied in a letter to my co-counsel about \n14 the fact -- be quiet. Be quiet and let me finish. \n15 You lied in a letter to my co-counsel, \n16 Mr. Leopold, in which you said -- it was a \n17 complete and utter lie -- that you were \n18 unavailable this morning because you had a \n19 hearing. That was a lie. I have never seen each \n20 lawyer deign to do something like that. \n21 So you will get the ex -- be quiet Let me \n22 finish. You behave. \n23 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at \n24 me. \n25 MR. TEIN: Listen. Be quiet and I won't \n127 \n1 have a need to point it at you. \n2 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at \n3 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold --\n4 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't point your finger at \nPage 108 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012503 \n-0929104.TXT \n5 me. \n6 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold, let me finish. \n7 MR. LEOPOLD: Don't raise your voice \n8 either. \n9 MR. TEIN: Mr. Leopold \n10 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, do you want to take \n11 care of this? \n12 MR. TEIN: Let me finish my sentence. The \n13 exhibits are marked. We are walking out of here. \n14 You are someone who misrepresents the \n15 record. It is absolutely atrocious what you do. \n16 That is not how a lawyer should behave. This \n17 deposition is over. You will get your exhibits, \n18 Mr. Leopold. \n19 MR. GOLDBERGER: I understand what you're \n20 saying, Michael, and I understand Ted's position. \n21 Just so there's -- we're going to have lots \n22 offer issues in this case. We're going to have \n23 lots of reasons to disagree. \n24 I'm going to take it over now and I'm going \n25 to make copies and I'm going to give them to \n128 \n1 Ms. Consor. If you want to go find some exhibit \n2 labels and put some exhibit labels on it, be my \n3 guest. But that's what I'm offering to do. \n4 THE WITNESS: Let me say two things, \n5 because I am happy to always disagree and with \n6 you, I have no problem; we could always do it \n7 professionally. \n8 I want to say two things so the record is \nPage 109 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012504 \n-0929104.TXT \n9 very clear. Since for whatever reason I have not \n10 been able to look at exhibits because they have \n11 been refused to have been shown to me --\n12 MR. TEIN: That's a lie. \n13 MR. LEOPOLD: Jack, if you represent that \n14 the documents have the appropriate exhibit numbers \n15 or some identifying markings, 25, 30.000, whatever \n16 they may be, then you can take them, make copies, \n17 send me a copy, make sure the court reporter gets \n18 a copy and then send me a bill for my copy, that's \n19 fine. I didn't know that they are marked that way \n20 because I haven't been able to look at them. \n21 MR. GOLDBERGER: They are barcoded and the \n22 number that we've made reference to in the \n23 deposition coincides with the barcoding. \n24 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine. Eight by eleven \n25 color laser copies are fine. \n129 \n1 MS. BELOHLAVEK: The State Attorneys Office \n2 is not going to charge anybody for color copies I \n3 print out. \n4 MR. LEOPOLD: That's fine He's going to \n5 take them back to his office . \n6 Secondly -- and I will be more than happy \n7 to do it, because it sounds like you all know more \n8 about it than I, but I'm happy to get affidavits \n9 from Mr. Pincus, Judge Stern, everybody else about \n10 what happened with this hearing today, because I \n11 \n12 \n13 \nknow very little about it. But my representations \nare what they are. \nMR. GOLDBERGER: They stay --\nPage 110 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012505 \n-0929104.TXT \n14 MR. LEOPOLD: Let me just finish for the \n15 record. \n16 Representations or comments about what \n17 happened, representation about this hearing this \n18 morning, I know very little about it. I --\n19 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'll take your word on \n20 that. \n21 MR. LEOPOLD: No, no, no. I just put it on \n22 the record. I will get an affidavit -- I'm \n23 assuming it sounds like you need it -- from Mr. \n24 Pincus. I have no clue about what happened and \n25 why it was canceled. All I was told when I was \n130 \n1 out of town yesterday was that the hearing this \n2 morning was cancelled. \n3 MR. GOLDBERGER: I'll take your word for \n4 it. \n5 MR. LEOPOLD: If you want an affidavit, \n6 I'll get it for you. \n7 MR. GOLDBERGER: It's a personal issue for \n8 me because I had to disrupt a vacation and if it \n9 was done just because it wasn't convenient for \n10 you, then I'm offended by that. But if you're \n11 telling me that it was planned and it didn't \n12 happen, I'll take your word for it. \n13 MR. LEOPOLD: I am more than happy to get \n14 you an affidavit, because I don't know the reason \n15 why it was canceled other than the fact that I'm \n16 assuming since my deposition was taken for four \n17 hours on Monday for preparation for the hearing \nPage 111 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012506 \n-0929104.TXT \n18 today, for whatever reason it was canceled, I am \n19 told it is being re-noticed. Why it was canceled \n20 I have no idea, but if your co-counsel wishes an \n21 affidavit to that effect from Mr. Pincus, I'm more \n22 than happy to get it. But I don't know the reason \n23 why it was canceled. \n24 MR. TEIN: I don't need it. But what I do \n25 take issue with is regardless of why it was \n131 \n1 canceled, you owed us the courtesy of saying, you \n2 know what? We can start earlier this morning. \n3 MR. LEOPOLD: I owe you nothing \n4 MR. TEIN: I don't care. Don't interrupt \n5 me. \n6 Because Jack canceled his vacation plans \n7 because of you. \n8 MR. GOLDBERGER: That's all right, that's \n9 all right. \n10 MR. TEIN: And you're selfish. And this \n11 deposition is over. Good-by Mr. Leopold. \n12 MR. GOLDBERGER: You can go off the record. \n13 - - - \n14 \n15 \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \nPage 112 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012507 \n-0929104.TXT \n23 \n24 \n25 \n132 \n1 CERTIFICATE \n2 - - - \n3 \n4 The State of Florida, \n5 County of Palm Beach. \n6 \n7 I hereby certify that I have read the \n8 foregoing deposition by me given, and that the statements \n9 contained herein are true and correct to the best of my \n10 knowledge and belief, with the exception of any \n11 corrections or notations made on the errata sheet, if one \n12 was executed. \n13 \n14 \n15 Dated this _______day of___________________, 2008. \n16 \n17 \n18 \n19 \n20 \n21 \n22 \n23 \n24 \n25 \nPage 113 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012508 \n-0929104.TXT \n133 \n1 DATE: [!MONTH2] DATE2, 2008 \n2 TO: \nX \n3 X \nX, Florida X \n4 \nIN RE: CASENAME \n5 CASE NO.: 2006 CF09454AXX \n6 Please take notice that on Wednesday, the \nDATE1 of [!MONTH1], 2008, you gave your deposition in the \n7 above-referred matter.

He was a busy guy? \n13 A. Yes. \n14 Q. He would be on the telephone talking Lo \n15 folks while you were giving a massage? \n16 A. Yes. Sometimes it would be just a massage \n17 and he'd be pretty much doing business the whole time. \n18 Q. Right. Certainly it wasn't sex or anything \n19 like that? \n20 A. No. \n21 Q.

Lefkowitz, Esq. \nKirkland & Ellis LLP \nCitigroup Center \n153 East 53rd Street \nNew York, New York 10022-4675 \nRe: Jeffrey Epstein \nDear Jay: \n500 S. Australian Ave, Ste 400 \nWest Palm Beach, FL 33401 \n(561) 820-8711 \nFacsimile: (561) 820-8777 \nDecember 13, 2007 \nI am writing not to respond to your asserted \"policy concerns\" regarding Mr. Epstein's Non-\nProsecution Agreement, which will be addressed by the United States Attorney, but the time has \ncome for me to respond to the ever-increasing attacks on my role in the investigation and \nnegotiations. \nIt is an understatement to say that I am surprised by your allegations regarding my role \nbecause I thought that we had worked very well together in resolving this dispute. I also am \nsurprised because I feel that I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect that the agreement \nwould have on Mr. Epstein and to make sure that you (and he) understood the repercussions of the \nagreement. For example, I brought to your attention that one potential plea could result in no gain \ntime for your client; I corrected one of your calculations of the Sentencing Guidelines that would \nhave resulted in Mr. Epstein spending far more time in prison than you projected; I contacted the \nBureau of Prisons to see whether Mr. Epstein would be eligible for the prison camp that you desired; \nand I told you my suspicions about the source of the press \"leak\" and suggested ways to avoid the \npress. Importantly, I continued to work with you in a professional manner even after I learned that \nyou had been proceeding in bad faith for several weeks — thinking that I had incorrectly concluded \nthat solicitation of minors to engage in prostitution was a registrable offense and that you would \n\"fool\" our Office into letting Mr. Epstein plead to a non-registrable offense. Even now, when it is \nclear that neither you nor your client ever intended to abide by the terms of the agreement that he \nsigned, I have never alleged misconduct on your part. \nThe first allegation that you raise is that I \"assiduously\" hid from you the fact that Bert \nOcariz is a friend of my boyfriend and that I have a \"longstanding relationship\" with Mr. Ocariz. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012577 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nDECEMBER 13, 2007 \nPAGE 2 OF 5 \nI informed you that I selected Mr. Ocariz because he was a friend and classmate of two people \nwhom I respected, and that I had never met or spoken with Mr. Ocariz prior to contacting him about \nthis case. All of those facts are true. I still have never met Mr. Ocariz, and, at the time that he and \nI spoke about this case, he did not know about my relationship with his friend. You suggest that I \nshould have explicitly informed you that one of the referrals came from my \"boyfriend\" rather than \nsimply a \"friend,\" which is the term I used, but it is not my nature to discuss my personal \nrelationships with opposing counsel. Your attacks on me and on the victims establish why I wanted \nto find someone whom I could trust with safeguarding the victims' best interests in the face of \nintense pressure from an unlimited number of highly skilled and well paid attorneys. Mr. Ocariz \nwas that person. \nOne of your letters suggests a business relationship between Mr. Ocariz and my boyfriend. \nThis is patently untrue and neither my boyfriend nor I would have received any financial benefit \nfrom Mr. Ocariz's appointment. Furthermore, after Mr. Ocariz learned more about Mr. Epstein's \nactions (as described below), he expressed a willingness to handle the case pro bono, with no \nfinancial benefit even to himself. Furthermore, you were given several other options to choose from, \nincluding the Podhurst firm, which was later selected by Judge Davis. You rejected those other \noptions. \nYou also allege that I improperly disclosed information about the case to Mr. Ocariz. I \nprovided Mr. Ocariz with a bare bones summary of the agreement's terms related to his appointment \nto help him decide whether the case was something he and his firm would be willing to undertake. \nI did not provide Mr. Ocariz with facts related to the investigation because they were confidential \nand instead recommended that he \"Google\" Mr. Epstein's name for background information. When \nMr. Ocariz asked for additional information to assist his firm in addressing conflicts issues, I \nforwarded those questions to you, and you raised objections for the first time. I did not share any \nfurther information about Mr. Epstein or the case. Since Mr. Ocariz had been told that you \nconcurred in his selection, out of professional courtesy, I informed Mr. Ocariz of the Office's \ndecision to use a Special Master to make the selection and told him that the Office had made contact \nwith Judge Davis. We have had no further contact since then and I have never had contact with \nJudge Davis. I understand from you that Mr. Ocariz contacted Judge Davis. You criticize his \ndecision to do so, yet you feel that you and your co-counsel were entitled to contact Judge Davis to \ntry to \"lobby\" him to select someone to your liking, despite the fact that the Non-Prosecution \nAgreement vested the Office with the exclusive right to select the attorney representative. \nAnother reason for my surprise about your allegations regarding misconduct related to the \nSection 2255 litigation is your earlier desire to have me perform the role of \"facilitator\" to convince \nthe victims that the lawyer representative was selected by the Office to represent their interests alone \nand that the out-of-court settlement of their claims was in their best interests. You now state that \ndoing the same things that you had asked me to do earlier is improper meddling in civil litigation. \nMuch of your letter reiterates the challenges to Detective Recarey's investigation that have \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012578 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nDECEMBER 13, 2007 \nPAGE 3 OF 5 \nalready been submitted to the Office on several occasions and you suggest that I have kept that \ninformation from those who reviewed the proposed indictment package. Contrary to your \nsuggestion, those submissions were attached to and incorporated in the proposed indictment \npackage, so your suggestion that I tried to hide something from the reviewers is false. I also take \nissue with the duplicity of stating that we must accept as true those parts of the Recarey reports and \nwitness statements that you like and we must accept as false those parts that you do not like. You \nand your co-counsel also impressed upon me from the beginning the need to undertake an \nindependent investigation. It seems inappropriate now to complain because our independent \ninvestigation uncovered facts that are unfavorable to your client. \nYou complain that I \"forced\" your client and the State Attorney's Office to proceed on \ncharges that they do not believe in, yet you do not want our Office to inform the State Attorney's \nOffice of facts that support the additional charge nor do you want any of the victims of that charge \nto contact Ms. Belohlavek or the Court. Ms. Belohlavek's opinion may change if she knows the full \nscope of your client's actions. You and I spent several weeks trying to identify and put together a \nplea to federal charges that your client was willing to accept. Yet your letter now accuses me of \n\"manufacturing\" charges of obstruction of justice, making obscene phone calls, and violating child \nprivacy laws. When Mr. Lourie told you that those charges would \"embarrass the Office,\" he meant \nthat the Office was unwilling to bend the facts to satisfy Mr. Epstein's desired prison sentence — a \nstatement with which I agree. \nI hope that you understand how your accusations that I imposed \"ultimatums\" and \"forced\" \nyou and your client to agree to unconscionable contract terms cannot square with the true facts of \nthis case. As explained in letters from Messrs. Acosta and Sloman, the indictment was postponed \nfor more than five months to allow you and Mr. Epstein's other attorneys to make presentations to \nthe Office to convince the Office not to prosecute. Those presentations were unsuccessful. As you \nmention in your letter, I —a simple line AUSA — handled the primary negotiations for the Office, and \nconducted those negotiations with you, Ms. Sanchez, Mr. Lewis, and a host of other highly skilled \nand experienced practitioners. As you put it, your group has a \"combined 250 years experience\" to \nmy fourteen. The agreement itself was signed by Mr. Epstein, Ms. Sanchez, and Mr. Lefcaut, \nwhose experience speaks for itself. You and I spent hours negotiating the terms, including when to \nuse \"a\" versus \"the\" and other minutiae. When you and I could not reach agreement, you repeatedly \nwent over my head, involving Messrs. Lourie, Menchel, Sloman, and Acosta in the negotiations at \nvarious times. In any and all plea negotiations the defendant understands that his options are to \nplead or to continue with the investigation and proceed to trial. Those were the same options that \nwere proposed to Mr. Epstein, and they are not \"persecution or intimidation tactics.\" Mr. Epstein \nchose to sign the agreement with the advice of a multitude of extremely noteworthy counsel. \nYou also make much of the fact that the names of the victims were not released to Mr. \nEpstein prior to signing the Agreement. You never asked for such a term. During an earlier \nmeeting, where Mr. Black was present, he raised the concern that you now voice. Mr. Black and \nI did not have a chance to discuss the issue, but I had already conceived of a way to resolve that \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012579 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nDECEMBER 13, 2007 \nPAGE 4 OF 5 \nissue if it were raised during negotiations. As I stated, it was not, leading me to believe that it was \nnot a matter of concern to the defense. Since the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement, the \nagents and I have vetted the list of victims more than once. In one instance, we decided to remove \na name because, although the minor victim was touched inappropriately by Mr. Epstein, we decided \nthat the link to a payment was insufficient to call it \"prostitution.\" I have always remained open to \na challenge to the list, so your suggestion that Mr. Epstein was forced to write a blank check is \nsimply unfounded. \nYour last set of allegations relates to the investigation of the matter. For instance, you claim \nthat some of the victims were informed of their right to collect damages prior to a thorough \ninvestigation of their allegations against Mr. Epstein. This also is false. None of the victims was \ninformed of the right to sue under Section 2255 prior to the investigation of the claims. Three \nvictims were notified shortly after the signing of the Non-Prosecution Agreement of the general \nterms of that Agreement. You raised objections to any victim notification, and no further \nnotifications were done. Throughout this process you have seen that I have prepared this case as \nthough it would proceed to trial. Notifying the witnesses of the possibility of damages claims prior \nto concluding the matter by plea or trial would only undermine my case. If my reassurances are \ninsufficient, the fact that not a single victim has threatened to sue Mr. Epstein should assure you of \nthe integrity of the investigation.' \n'There are numerous other unfounded allegations in your letter about document demands, \nthe money laundering investigation, contacting potential witnesses, speaking with the press, and the \nlike. For the most part, these allegations have been raised and disproven earlier and need not be \nreaddressed. However, with respect to the subpoena served upon the private investigator, contrary \nto your assertion, and as your co-counsel has already been told, I did consult with the Justice \nDepartment prior to issuing the subpoena and I was told that because I was not subpoenaing an \nattorney's office or an office physically located within an attorney's office, and because the business \ndid private investigation work for individuals (rather than working exclusively for Mr. Black), I \ncould issue a grand jury subpoena in the normal course, which is what I did. I also did not \n\"threaten\" the State Attorney's Office with a grand jury subpoena, as the correspondence with their \ngrand jury coordinator makes perfectly clear. \nWith regard to your allegation of my filing the Palm Beach Police Department's probable \ncause affidavit \"with the court knowing that the public could access it,\" I do not know to what you \nare referring. All documents related to the grand jury investigation have been filed under seal, and \nthe Palm Beach Police Department's probable cause affidavit has never been filed with the Court. \nIf, in fact, you are referring to the Ex Parte Declaration of Joseph Recarey that was filed in response \nto the motion to quash the grand jury subpoena, it was filed both under seal and ex parte, so no one \nshould have access to it except the Court and myself. Those documents are still in the Court file \nonly because you have violated one of the terms of the Agreement by failing to \"withdraw \n[Epstein's] pending motion to intervene and to quash certain grand jury subpoenas.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012580 \nJAY P. LEFKOWITZ, ESQ. \nDECEMBER 13, 2007 \nPAGE 5 OF 5 \nWith respect to Ms. Miller, I contacted her attorney - who was paid for by Mr. Epstein and \nwas directed by counsel for Mr. Epstein to demand immunity - and asked only whether he still \nrepresented Ms. Miller and if he wanted me to send the victim notification letter to him. He asked \nwhat the letter would say and I told him that the letter would be forthcoming in about a week and \nthat I could not provide him with the terms. With respect to Ms. Miller's status as a victim, you \nagain want us to accept as true only facts that are beneficial to your client and to reject as false \nanything detrimental to him. Ms. Miller made a number of statements that are contradicted by \ndocumentary evidence and a review of her recorded statement shows her lack of credibility with \nrespect to a number of statements. Based upon all of the evidence collected, Ms. Miller is classified \nas a victim as defined by statute. Of course, that does not mean that Ms. Miller considers herself \na victim or that she would seek damages from Mr. Epstein. I believe that a number of the identified \nvictims will not seek damages, but that does not negate their legal status as victims. \nI hope that you now understand that your accusations against myself and the agents are \nunfounded. In the future, I recommend that you address your accusations to me so that I can correct \nany misunderstandings before you make false allegations to others in the Department. I hope that \nwe can move forward with a professional resolution of this matter, whether that be by your client's \nadherence to the contract that he signed, or by virtue of a trial. \nSincerely, \nR. Alexander Acosta \nUnited States Attorney \nBy: s/A. Marie Villafana \nA. Marie Villafaria \nAssistant United States Attorney \ncc: R.

The \nGrand Jury consists of from sixteen to twenty-three persons from the Southern District of \nFlorida. It is their responsibility to inquire into federal crimes which may have been \ncommitted in this District. \nAs a Grand Jury witness you will be asked to testify and answer questions under oath, \nand to produce records and documents. Only the members of the Grand Jury, attorneys for \nthe United States and a stenographer- are permitted in the Grand Jury roorn while you testify.. \n. The U.S. Department of Justice encourages prosecutors to notify an individual in \nappropriate cases that he or she is a target of a grand jury investigation. Accordingly, you \nare hereby notified that you are a target of a federal grand jury investigation in the Southern \nDistrict of Florida concerning suspected violations of federal law, including but not limited \nto, possible violations of Title 18, United- States Code, Sections 2, 371, 1512, 1591, 1952, \n1956, 1960, 2421, 2422, and 2423. \nYou are advised that the destruction or alteration of any document required to be \nproduced:before the grand jury constitutes serious violation of federal law, including but.not \nlimited to Obstraction of justice. \nA \"target\" is a person as to whom the prosecutors or the Grand Jury have substantial \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012599 \n08/31/2607 13;04 FAX 5618021787 USA() WPB FL \nMs. \nAugust 31, 2007 \nPage 2 \nepos \nevidence linking him or her to the commission of a crime and who, in the judgment of the \nprosecutors, is a putative defendant. \nThis letter constitutes an invitation to you to testify on your own behalf before the \ngrand jury about matters under investigation. Of course, you are not required to appear \nbefore the grand jury. The decision whether to do so is a voluntary matter which is entirely \nup to you. The grand jury, if in fact it learns of this opportunity afforded to you, will be \ninstructed not to draw any adverse inference from your failure to appear should you decide \nnot to accept this invitation. You mustfurther understand that should you decide to testify, \nyour testimony could be used against you if any criminal charges should be flied against you. \nShould you decide to appear before the grand jury, you will have the same rights and \nobligations as any non-immonized grand jury witness. Specifically, \nYou may refuse to answer any question if a truthful answer to the question \nwould tend to incriminate you. \nYou have the right to stop answering questions at any time. \nAnything you say maybe used against you at the grand jury or in a subsequent \nlegal proceeding. \nThe grand jury will permit. you a reasonable opportunity to ..stop . outside the \ngrand jury room to consult with your attorney, if you so desire, at any point \nduring the testimony you give, \nPlease be further advised that the giving of false testimony before the grand jur3r will \nsubject -you to a prosecution for perjury in addition to the violations set forth above. \nAs a target of a grand jury investigation who has been asked to appear before the \ngrand jury, you may wish to retain the services of an attorney. If you =not afford the \nservices of independent counsel, the Court may be able to appoint Counsel to represent you. \nIf you would like the United States to ask the Court to appoint an attorney to represent you, \nplease contact the undersigned at 561 209-1047, The United States is investigating other \nindividuals, and you may be interested in cooperating with the United States against those \nother targets.

LLC \nDear Mr. Lelbouri: \nI write in response to your letter of July 18, 2007 regarding the grand jury subpoena issued \nto the Custodian ofRecords for NES, LLC. Ihave attached an identical subpoena containing areturn \ndate of September 11, 2007, and subpoenas for two NES employees, Eric Gany and Harry Beller. \nIf you will not be representing Messrs. Gany and Beller, please let me know. \nFirst, as I mentioned in my earlier correspondence, a properly executed declaration from. the \nCustodian of Records is needed, and, if no documents responsive to a particular request exist, the \nCustodian should certify that under penalty of perjury. \nSecond, you write that NES has no documents responsive to Requests 1 through 5. 'know \nthat NES has several credit card accounts for the benefit of the persons who manage Mr. Epstein's \nproperties, including Janusz Banasiak and Alfredo Rodriguez. I also know that NES regularly \nreceives money from an account that is used to pay expenses at 358 El Milo Way and also wires \nmoney to that same account Those wire transfers fall within the time period called for by the \nsubpoena and number in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. IfNES does not maintain records of \nits banking activities, then I would like to see a copy of its document retention policy, so I have \nadded that to the Attachment to the Subpoena. \nThird, Mr. Manche's con:unent to you about potential money laundering charges related only \nto a resolution ofthe case. In other words, if the sex offense case is resolved, the Office would close \nits investigation into other areas as well The matter has not been, and it does not appear that it will \nbe, resolved so the money laundering investigation continues, and Request Number 6 will not be \nwithdrawn. The request is not overbroad and is stated with particularity, so please comply with the \nrequest by the new deadline. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012603 \n68/16/2007 17:06  FAX $618021787 \nUSA() WPB FL 0003 \nGERALD LEMUR% ESQ. \nAuGUST 16,2007 \nPAGE 2 07 2 \nWith respect to paragraph 7, the information provided regarding the pilots came from the \ncorporate records of Hypezion and TEGE, Inc., not NES.

I think they would be happy knowing that their \nhourly rate will be paid when it is billed. The concern is, if all 40 girls decide they want to sue, \nthey don't want to be in a situation where Mr. Epstein says this is getting too expensive, we won' \nt pay any more attorneys' fees. \nTwo suggestions, that I haven't run past Bert, are: \n1. Mr. Epstein signs a standard fee agreement, where one of his attorneys or \naccountants who is not working on the damages litigation receives a monthly bill with \nattorney's fees charged at an hourly rate and costs billed monthly. The bills will have \nany privileged information redacted. If there is a dispute about a bill that cannot be \nresolved, it will be submitted to a mediator for resolution. \n2. If that is too open-ended for Mr. Epstein, do the hourly/monthly billing until Berl. \nhas had a chance to confer with all of the girls to determine how many want him to \nrepresent them. Once it is known how many girls will be represented by Bert, and maybe \nwho those girls are, there can be a more educated discussion about estimated fees and \ncosts. \nJust some food for thought.

An integral player in Epstein's Florida scheme was Haley Robson, a Palm Beach \nHERMAN 8, MERMELSTEIN, P, A. \n- 2 - \nwww.hermanlaw_com \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012638 \nCommunity College student from Loxahatchee, Florida. She recruited girls ostensibly to give a \nwealthy man a massage for monetary compensation in his Palm Beach mansion. Under Epstein's \nplan, Ms. Robson would be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his Palm Beach residence \nor soon after he had arrived there. Epstein or someone on his behalf directed Ms. Robson to bring \none or more underage girls to the residence. Ms. Robson, upon information and belief, generally \nsought out economically disadvantaged underage girls from Loxahatchee and surrounding areas who \nwould be enticed by the money being offered - generally $200 to $300 per \"massage\" session - and \nwho were perceived as less likely to complain to authorities or have credibility if allegations of \nimproper conduct were made. This was an important element of Epstein's plan. \n13. Epstein's plan and scheme reflected a particular pattern and method. Upon arrival. at \nEpstein's mansion, Mr. Robson would introduce each victim to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, \nwho gathered the girl' s personal information, including her name and telephone number. Ms. Kellen \nwould then bring the girl up a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage table in addition \nto other furnishings. There were photographs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the \nbedroom. Ms. Kellen would then leave the girl alone in this room, whereupon Epstein would enter \nwearing only a towel. He would then remove his towel, lay down naked on the massage table, and \ndirect the girl to remove her clothes. He then would perform one or more Iewd, lascivious and \nsexual acts, including masturbation and touching the girl's vagina with a vibrator. \n14. Consistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Ms. Robson recruited Jane Doe to \ngive Epstein a massage for monetary compensation. Ms. Robson brought Jane to Epstein's mansion \nin Palm Beach. Jane was introduced. to Sarah Kellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room \nwith the massage table. She was alone in the room when Epstein arrived wearing only a towel. He \nHERMAN X...-.

In shock, fear and trepidation, Jane complied, removing her clothes except for her \nunderwear. Epstein then sexually assaulted Jane. \n15. After Epstein had completed the assault, he left the room. Jane was then able to get \ndressed, leave the room and go back down the stairs. She then met Ms. Robson again who brought \nJane home. Jane was paid $300 by Epstein. Ms. Robson was p aid $200 by Epstein for bringing Jane \nto him. \n16. As a result of this encounter with Epstein, the 14-year old Jane experienced \nconfusion, shame, humiliation, embarrassment and the assault sent her life into a downward spiral. \nCOUNT I \nSexual Assault \n17, Plaintiff Jane Doe by and through her Father, as parent and natural guardian, repeats \nand realleges paragraphs I through 16 above. \n18.

She is suing on grounds of sexual assault and intentional infliction of emotional distress. \n\"She felt intimidated. She felt scared,\" Herman said.

I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving. \nRegarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis' selection, I'd like to make a few \nobservations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making \nreasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact, \nwhen I told you of Judge Davis's selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 2l4, \nyou and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the \nselection. Podhurst and Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team \nincluding Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who \nsaid he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and Josephsberg have \nlong-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It's hard for me to imagine \nhow much more vetting needs to be done. \nThe United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of \nthe anticipated upcoming events and their rights associated with the agreement entered into by \nthe United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since \nyou were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting process come to an end. \nTherefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection by COB \ntomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give \nme the go-ahead on Podhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously \nsend you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday, \nNovember 29'1. Thanks, \nJeff \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012654 \nTAB 35 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012655 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS LLP \nAND AFFILIATED PARTNERSHIPS \n777 South Figueroa Street \nLos Angeles, California 90017 \nKenneth W.

Fisher \nAssistant Attorney General \nDepartment of Justice \nCriminal Division \n950 Pennsylvania Avenue NW \nRoom 2107 \nWashington, DC 20530 \nRe: Jeffey Epstein \nDear Ms. Fisher: \nFacsimile: \n(213) 680-8500 \nI represent Jeffrey Epstein, who, as you may be aware, was the target of a dual \ninvestigation by both state and federal authorities in Florida for acts relating to his interactions \nwith numerous young women. As you may also be aware, Mr. Epstein has entered into a \nDeferred Prosecution Agreement (the \"Agreement\") with the United States Attorney's Office for \nthe Southern District of Florida (the \"USAO\") to resolve its criminal investigation of him. I run \nwriting to. request a meeting with you to discuss certain aspects of this case that I find especially \ntroublesome. \nAs part of the agreement Mr. Epstein was required to sign to avoid a federal indictment, \nMr. Epstein was required to waive jurisdiction and liability under 18 U.S.C. §2255 for the \nsettlement of monetary claims that might be made by it group of unidentified alleged victims \nwho will be identified by the USA() at some point in the future. Neither I, nor any of the other \ndefense lawyers involved in this matter, have ever heard of such a procedure. And as part of this \nAgreement, Mr. Epstein is precluded from contesting liability as to civil lawsuits seeking \nmonetary compensation for damages brought by any of the identified individuals who elect to \nsettle their civil claims for the statutory minimum of either $50,000 (the amount set by Congress \nas of the date of the occurrences) or $150,000 (the amount currently set by statute) or some other \nagreed upon damage amount. We believe that the utilization of 18 U.S.C. § 2255 as a pre-\ncondition of criminal plea agreements or non-prosecution agreements is highly unusual and \nrequires careful consideration and additional guidance by your Office. We also believe that the \nChicago Hong Kong London Munich New York San Francisco Washington, D.C. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012656 \nIURKLAND 8.. ELLIS \nHonorable Mice S. Fisher \nNovember 28, 2007 \nPage 2 \nmanner in which the USAO has interpreted the settlement process for these identified individuals \nunder the Agreement requires guidance. These areas are more fully detailed below.* \nFirst. Federal criminal investigators and prosecutors should not be in the business \nof promoting civil lawsuits as a condition precedent to entering non-prosecution or deferred \nprosecution agreements. This is especially true where the vehicle for the financial settlement \nunder the Agreement requires payment in a lump sum without requiring proof of actual injury or \nloss — federal authorities should therefore be particularly sensitive to avoid causing a prejudiced \nand unfair result. 18 U.S.C. § 2255 is a civil statute implanted in the criminal code; in contrast to \nall other criminal restitution statutes, § 2255 fails to correlate payments to specific injuries or \nlosses. Instead, the statute presumes that victims have sustained damages of at least a minimum \nlump sum without regard to whether the complainants suffered actual medical, psychological or \nother forms of individualized harm. We presume that it is for this reason that 18 U.S.C. § 2255 \nhas never before been employed in this manner in connection with a non-prosecution or, as here, \na deferred prosecution agreement. In short, the USAO is operating in uncharted territory. \nSecond. 18 U.S.C. § 2255 creates the potential for compromising witness \ntestimony. Although generally the Government may promise or provide traditional consideration \nto potential witnesses, employing a civil statute that promises a lump sum payment to potential \nwitnesses without proof of actual liability or damage provides an extraordinary incentive that is \nincompatible with the truth-seeking functions of the criminal justice system. Guidelines or other \npolicy directives should be considered to control the extent to which witnesses are informed by \ninvestigators about the availability of such financial windfalls. Additionally, an inquiry is \nnecessary in this specific case to assure that disclosures to potential witnesses did not undermine \nthe reliability of the results of the federal criminal investigation of Mr. Epstein. \nThird. The USA() has provided no information as to the specific claims made by \neach identified individual, nor were we provided the names or ages of those individuals or the \ntime-frame of the alleged conduct The USAO's reluctance to provide Mr. Epstein with any \ninformation with respect to the allegations against him leaves wide open the opportunity for \nmisconduct by federal investigators. In addition, this information vacuum eliminates the ability \nfor Mr. Epstein and/or his agents to verify that the allegations at issue are grounded in real \nevidence. Indeed, the requirement that a target of federal criminal prosecution agree to waive his \nright to contest liability as to unnamed civil complainants creates at minimum an appearance of \ninjustice, both because of the obvious Due Process concerns of waiving rights without notice of \n* In addition to the areas identified below, it was and remains our position that federal prosecution of this matter is \nentirely inappropriate based on the prior application and legislative histories of the relevant federal statutes. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012657 \nKIRKLAND &ELLIS \nHonorable Alice S. Fisher \nNovember 28, 2007 \nPage 3 \neven the identity of the complainant(s) and because of the involvement of the federal criminal \njustice system in civil settlements between private individuals. \nFourth. The USA() has improperly insisted that the chosen attorney \nrepresentative should be able to litigate the claims of individuals, which violates the terms of the \nAgreement and deeply infringes upon the spirit and nature of the Agreement. Initially, for the \nsake of expediting a settlement in this matter, we suggested that Mr. Epstein establish a \nrestitution fund specifically for the settlement of the identified individuals' civil claims and that \nan impartial, independent representative be appointed to administer that fund. Notably, such a \nrestitution fund was created in a federal case, U.S. v. Boehm, Case No. 3:04CR00003 (D Alaska \n2004). The federal prosecutors here rejected this idea, and they insisted that an attorney \nrepresentative, paid for by Mr. Epstein, be appointed. Yet, there was no suggestion at the time \nthat the attorney representative's duties included litigating claims on behalf of the identified \nindividuals. However, after the parties agreed to the appointment of an attorney representative, \nthe prosecutors announced that the criteria for choosing an appropriate attorney representative \nnow included that the individual be \"a plaintiff's lawyer capable of handling multiple lawsuits \nagainst high profile attorneys.\" This interpretation of the scope of the attorney representative's \nrole is far outside the common understanding that existed when we negotiated Mr. Epstein's \nsettlement with the USAO. Furthermore, we firmly believe that ethics rules preclude the \nrepresentative from litigating claims on behalf of the identified individuals. \nIn sum, we believe that the actions undertaken in this matter by the USA() with \nrespect to the 18 U.S.C. § 2255 provisions of the Agreement are highly unusual. We respectfully \nrequest a meeting with you at your earliest convenience to discuss the important issues raised by \nthe USAO's conduct in this deeply policy-laden matter. \nSincerely, \nid.

Alexander Acosta, we have \nindependently evaluated certain issues raised in the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein to determine \nwhether a decision to prosecute Mr. Epstein for federal criminal violations would contradict \ncriminal enforcement policy interests. As part of our evaluation, we have reviewed letters \nwritten on behalf of Mr. Epstein on February 1, 2007, June 25, 2007, July 6, 2007, March 28, \n2008, April 8, 2008, April 28, 2008, and May 14, 2008, with their attachments. We have also \nreviewed memos prepared by the U.S. Attorney's Office. As you will recall, we met with you \nand other representatives of Mr. Epstein to further discuss your views on the propriety of a \nfederal prosecution. We have discussed the factual and legal issues you raise with the Criminal \nDivision's Appellate Section, and we consulted with the Office of Enforcement Operations \nconcerning the petite policy. \nWe are examining the narrow question as to whether there is a legitimate basis for the \nU.S. Attorney's Office to proceed with a federal prosecution of Mr. Epstein. Ultimately, the \nprosecutorial decision making authority within a U.S. Attorney's Office lies with the U.S. \nAttorney. Therefore, to borrow a phrase from the case law, the question we soudit to answer \nwas whether U.S. Attorney Acosta would abuse his discretion if he authorized prosecution in this \ncase. \nAs you know, our review of this case is limited, both factually and legally. We have not \nlooked at the entire universe of facts in this case. It is not the role of the Criminal Division to re-\nconduct a complete factual inquiry from scratch. Furthermore, we did not analyze any issues \nconcerning prosecution under federal statutes that do not pertain to child exploitation, such as the \nmoney laundering statutes, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012670 \n05/16/2008 11:16 FAX \n05/16/08 FRI 11:08 FAX \n0003/006 \nQ003 \nAs was made clear at the outset, we did not review the facts, circumstances, or terms \nincluded in the plea offer, nor any allegations that individuals involved in the investigation \nengaged in misconduct. Despite that agreement, we note that your letters of April 8, April 28, \nand May 14 focus in large part on accusations of investigative or prosecutorial misconduct. Not \nonly do allegations of prosecutorial misconduct fall outside the boundary of our agreed review, \nthey also fall outside the authority of the Criminal Division in the first instance. Simply, the \nCriminal Division does not investigate or resolve allegations of professional misconduct by \nfederal prosecutors. For these reasons, we do not respond to the portion of those letters that \ndiscuss alleged misconduct. \nBased on our review of all of these materials, and after careful consideration of the issues, \nwe conclude that U.S. Attorney Acosta could properly use his discretion to authorize prosecution \nin this case. We will briefly address each of the issues that you have raised. \nKnowledge of age. Federal child exploitation statutes differ as to whether there must be \nproof that the defendant was aware that the children were under the age of 18. However, even \nfor those statutes where knowledge of age is an element of the offense, it is possible to satisfy \nthat element with proof that the defendant was deliberately ignorant of facts which would suggest \nthat the person was a minor. For that reason, the fact that some of the individuals allegedly lied \nto Mr. Epstein about their age is not dispositive of the issue. While there may be an open factual \nissue as to Mr. Epstein's knowledge, we cannot say that it would be impossible to prove \nknowledge of age for any such charges which require it. Therefore, Mr. Acosta could rightfully \nconclude that this factual issue is best resolved by a jury. \nTravel for the purpose. In the materials you prepared, you suggest that Mr. Epstein \nshould not be charged with violating 18 U.S.C. § 2423(1,) because his dominant purpose in going \nto Florida was not to engage in illegal sexual activity, but rather to return to one of his residences. \nWhile we fully understand your argument, we also find that the U.S. Attorney's office has a good \nfaith basis fully to develop the facts on this issue and brief the law to permit a court to decide \nwhether the law properly reaches such conduct. Mr. Acosta would not be abusing his discretion \nif he decided to pursue such a course of action. \nIntent to engage in the conduct at the time of travel, Based on our review of the facts of \nthis case, we respectfully disagree that there is no evidence concerning Mr. Epstein's intent when \nhe traveled, and when that intent was formed. Should Mr. Acosta elect to let the case proceed so \nthat a jury can resolve this factual issue, he would be within his discretion to do so. \nUse of a facility or means of interstate or foreign commerce. Much of the materials you \nhave prepared and much of the meeting we had focused on 18 U.S.C. § 2422(b), specifically your \ncontention that Mr. Epstein did not use the phone to coerce anyone to engage in illegal sexual \nactivity.. We understand the issue you raise concerning the statutory interpretation. As before, \nhowever, we cannot agree that there is no evidence that would support a charge under Section \n2422(b), nor can we agree that there is no argument in support of the application of that statute to \nthis case. Finally, our assessment is that the application of that statute to these facts would not be \n2 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012671 \n05/16/2008 11:16 FAX \n05/16/08 FRI 11:09 FAX \ng1004/006 \n0004 \nso novel as to implicate the so-called \"clear statement rule,\" the Ex Post Facto clause, or the Due \nProcess clause. As with the other legal issues, Mr. Acosta may elect to proceed with the case. \nAbsence of coercion. With respect to 18 § 1591, the alleged absence of the use of \nforce, fraud, or coercion is of no moment. The statute does not require the use of force, fraud, \nand coercion against minors. Because of their age, a degree of coercion is presumed. In your \nmaterials, you note that the statute requires that the minors must be \"caused\" to engage in a \ncommercial sex act, further arguing that the word \"cause\" suggests that a certain amount of \nundue influence was used. We reject that interpretation, as it would read back into the offense an \nelement—coercion—that Congress has expressly excluded. We have successfully prosecuted \ndefendants for the commercial sexual exploitation of minors, even when the minors testified that \nnot only did they voluntarily engage in the commercial, sex acts, it was their idea to do so. As \nsuch, Mr. Acosta could properly decide to pursue charges under Section 1591 even if there is no \nevidence of coercion. \nMore broadly, a defendant's criminal liability does not hinge on his victim identifying as \nhaving suffered at his hands. Therefore, a prosecution could proceed, should Mr. Acosta decide \nto do so, even though some of the young women allegedly have said that they do not view \nthemselves as victims. \nWitness credibility. As all prosecutors know, there are no perfect witnesses. Particularly \nin cases involving exploited children, as one member of your defense team, Ms. Thacker, surely \nknows from her work at CEOS, it is not uncommon for victim-witnesses to give conflicting \nstatements. The prosecutors are in the best position to assess the witness's credibility. Often, the \nprosecutor may decide that the best approach is to present th.e witness, let defense counsel \nexplore the credibility problems on cross-examination, and let the jury resolve the issue. Mr. \nAcosta would be within his authority to select that approach, especially when here there are \nmultiple, mutually-corroborating witnesses. \nContradictions and omissions in the search warrant application. We have carefully \nreviewed the factual issues you raise concerning the search warrant application. For a search \nwarrant to be suppressed, however, the factual errors must be material, and the officers must not \nhave proceeded in good faith. Despite the numerous factual errors you describe, the U.S. \nAttorney's Office could still plausibly argue that the mistakes—whether inadvertent or \nintentional—were not material to the determination that probable cause existed for a search, and \nthat the search was in good faith in any event. As such, Mr. Acosta could properly elect to \ndefend the search warrant in court rather than forego prosecution. \nPetite 1?olicy: After reviewing the petite policy and consulting with the Office of \nEnforcement Operations (\"0E0\"), we conclude that the petite policy does not prohibit federal \nprosecution in this case, According to the U.S. Attorney's Manual, the petite policy \"applies \nwhenever there has been a prior state or federal prosecution resulting in an acquittal, a \nconviction, including one resulting from a plea agreement, or a dismissal or other termination of \n3 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012672 \n05/16/2008 11:17 FAX \n05/16/08 FRI 11:09 FAX\nIJ \nUO05/006 \n005 \nthe case on the merits after jeopardy has attached.\" USAIVI 9-2.031(C). Our understanding is \nthat the state case is still pending. As such, tehe procedural posture of the state case does not \nimplicate the petite policy. \nWe recognize that the petite policy could be triggered if the state case concluded after a \nfederal indictment was issued but prior to the commencement of any federal trial. Id. However, \nthe policy \"does not apply ... where the [state] prosecution involved only a minor part of the \ncontemplated federal charges.\" USAM 9-2.031(B). Based on our understanding of the possible \nfederal charges and existing state charges, we do not think the petite policy would be an issue \nshould federal proceedings take place. \nFederalism and Prosecutorial Discretion. All of the above issues essentially ask whether \na federal prosecution can proceed. We understand, however, that you also ask whether a federal \nprosecution should proceed, even in the event that all of the elements of a federal offense could \nbe proven. On this issue, you raised two arguments: that the conduct at issue here is traditionally \na state concern because the activity is entirely local, and that the typical prosecution under federal \nchild exploitation statutes have different facts than the ones implicated here. You have \nessentially asked us to look into whether a prosecution would so violate federal prosecutorial \npolicy that a United States Attorney's Office should not pursue a prosecution. We do not think \nthat is the case here for the following reasons. \nSimply, the commercial sexual exploitation of children is a federal concern, even when \nthe conduct is local, and regardless of whether the defendant provided the child (the \"pimp\") or \npaid for the child (the `John\"). In your materials, you refer to a letter sent by the Department of \nJustice to Congress in which the Department expresses concern over the expansion of federal \nlaws to reach almost all instances of prostitution. In that portion of the letter, the Department \nwas expressly referring to a proposed federal law that reach adult prostitution where no force, \nfraud, or coercion was used. Indeed, the point being made in that letter is that the Department's \nefforts are properly focused on the commercial sexual exploitation of children and the \nexploitation of adults through the use of force, fraud, or coercion. As such, there is no \ninconsistency between the position taken in that letter and the federal prosecution of wholly local \ninstances of the commercial sexual exploitation of children. \nIf Congress wanted to limit the reach of federal statutes only to those who profit from the \ncommercial sexual exploitation of children, or only to those who actually traffic children across \nstate lines, it could have done so. It did not. Finally, that a prosecution of Mr. Epstein might not \nlook precisely like the cases that came before it is not dispositive. We can say with confidence \nthat this case is consistent in principle with other federal prosecutions nationwide. As such, Mr. \nAcosta can soundly exercise his authority to decide to pursue a prosecution even though it might \ninvolve a novel application of a federal statute. \nConc/usion. After carefully considering all the factual and legal issues raised, as well as \nthe arguments concerning the general propriety ()fa federal case against Mr. Epstein on these \n4 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012673 \n05/16/2008 11:17 FAX \n05/16/08 FRI 1110 FAX \nQ5006/006 \n12006 \nfacts, we conclude that federal prosecution in this case would not be improper or inappropriate. \nWhile you raise many compelling arguments, we do not see anything that says to us categorically \nthat a federal case should not be brought.

I was \nespecially surprised given that your letter arrived on only the second day back to work after the \nThanksgiving Holiday, and yet your demands regarding timing suggest that I have been sitting on \nmy hands for days. \nYou should know that the first time I learned about Judge Davis's selection of Podhurst \nand Josephsberg, and indeed the first time I ever heard their names, was in our meeting with you \non Wednesday of last week. Nevertheless, I have now been able to confer with my client, and we \nhave determined that the selection of Podhurst and Josephsberg are acceptable to us, reserving, of \ncourse, our previously stated objections to the manner in which you have interpreted the section \n2255 portions of the Agreement. \nWe do, however, strongly and emphatically object to your sending a letter to the alleged \nvictims. Without a fair opportunity to review and the ability to make objections to this letter, it is \ncompletely unacceptable that you would send it without our consideration. Additionally, given \nthat the US Attorney's office has made clear it cannot vouch for the claims of the victims, it \nwould be incendiary and inappropriate for your Office to send such a letter. Indeed, because it is \na certainty that any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your actions will only \nhave the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein and promoting spurious civil litigation directed at him. \nWe believe it is entirely unprecedented, and in any event, inappropriate for the Government to be \nthe instigator of such lawsuits. \nFinally, we disagree with your view that you are required to notify the alleged victims \npursuant to the Justice for All Act of 2004. First, 18 USC section 2255, the relevant statute \nunder the Non-Prosecution Agreement for the settlement of civil remedies, does not have any \nconnection to the Justice for All Act. Section 2255 was enacted as part of a different statute. \nSecond, the Justice for All Act refers to restitution, and section 2255 is not a restitution statute. \nIt is a civil remedy. As you know, we had offered to provide a restitution fund for the alleged \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012676 \nJay, \nJ.L 10 Li %el V IA 1V111.V,..1..7. .1 10 .7 VIA 13.11%./ VV VVVS 11E411 LJ.L.LV.LVUL FAA./ V 111V Li 1,...,11-11.1.11.1,J11 1111111 101 1.11V 1411051.0 \nvictims in this matter; however that option was rejected by your Office. Had that option been \nchosen, we would not object to your notifying the alleged victims at this point. At this juncture, \nhowever, we do not accept your contention that there is a requirement that the government notify \nthe alleged victims of a potential civil remedy in this case. \nAccordingly, for all the reasons we have stated above, we respectfully -- and firmly --\nobject to your sending any letter whatsoever to the alleged victims in this matter. Furthermore, if \na letter is to be sent to these individuals, we believe we should have a right to review and make \nobjections to that submission prior to it being sent to any alleged victims. We also request that if \nyour Office believes that it must send a letter to go to the alleged victims, who still have not been \nidentified to us, it should happen only after Mr. Epstein has entered his plea. This letter should \nthen come from the attorney representative, and not from the Government, to avoid any bias. \nAs you know, Judge Starr has requested a meeting with Assistant Attorney General Fisher \nto address what we believe is the unprecedented nature of the section 2255 component of the \nAgreement. We are hopeful that this meeting will take place as early as next week. Accordingly, \nwe respectfully request that we postpone our discussion of sending a letter to the alleged victims \nuntil after that meeting. We strongly believe that rushing to send any letter out this week is not \nthe wisest manner in which to proceed. Given that Mr. Epstein will not even enter his plea for \nanother few weeks, time is clearly not of the essence regarding any notification to the identified \nindividuals. \nThanks very much, \nJay \n\"Sloman, Jeff (USAFLS)\" \n1\"Sloman, Jeff (USAFLS)\" \n11/27/2007 01:55 PM \nTo \"Jay Lefkowitz\" \nCC \"Acosta, Alex (USAFLS)\" \nSubject Epstein \nPlease accept my apologies for not getting back to you sooner but I was a little under the weather \nyesterday. I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving. \nRegarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis' selection, I'd like to make a few \nobservations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making \nreasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact, \nwhen I told you of Judge Davis's selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 2e, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012677 \nyou and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the \nselection. Podhurst and Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team \nincluding Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who \nsaid he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and Josephsberg have \nlong-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It's hard for me to imagine \nhow much more vetting needs to be done. \nThe United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of \nthe anticipated upcoming events and their rights associated with the agreement entered into by \nthe United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since \nyou were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting process come to an end. \nTherefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis's selection by COB \ntomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give \nme the go-ahead on Podhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously \nsend you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday, \nNovember 29th. Thanks, \nJeff \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012678 \nTAB 40 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012679 \n_ \n**TAX MATTERS- IRS Circular 230 Disclosure: To ensure compliance \nwith requirements imposed by the IRS, we inform you that any tax \nadvice contained in this communication (including attachments) was \nnot intended or written to be used, and cannot be used, for the \npurpose of (i) avoiding penalties under the Internal Revenue Code \nor (ii) promoting, marketing or recommending to another party any \ntransaction or matter addressed herein.

The Office has never agreed \nthat a state prison sentence is not appropriate for Mr. Epstein. Rather we simply stated that if Mr. \nEpstein preferred to serve his sentence in a federal penetentiary, we would be willing to explore a \nfederal conviction that may allow that in lieu of any state resolution. Further, as I made clear in \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 012680 \nour follow up telephone conversation after the meeting, a plea to two federal misdemeanors was \nnever extended or meant as an offer. \nWe also would reiterate that the agreement to Section 2255 liability applies to all of the minor \ngirls identified during the federal investigation, not just the 12 that form the basis of an initial \nplanned charging instrument. \nAs you know, the ability to engage in flexible plea negotiations is dramatically changed upon the \nreturn of an indictment. Once an indictment is returned, the Office does not intend to file a \nSuperseding Information containing a lesser charge or to dismiss the case in favor of state \nprosecution. \nPlease let us know your client's decision by no later than August 17. I have conferred with U.S. \nAttorney Acosta who has asked me to communicate that the two-year term of incarceration is a \nnon-negotiable minimum to vindicate a federal interest, and, at this time, he is not inclined to \nmeet with counsel for Mr. Epstein. \nSincerely, \nR.
