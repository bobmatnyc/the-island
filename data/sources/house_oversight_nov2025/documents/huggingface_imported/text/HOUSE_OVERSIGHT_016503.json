  "text": "evaluate whether the proposed redactions are reasonable. Because the Post cannot review any\npart of the briefs, it is impossible for the Post to know whether the information it seeks is in the\nprocedural history section of the People’s brief or in other parts of the briefing filed in the\nAppeal. Moreover, courts must order narrow redactions where possible to avoid overbroad\nsealing. See, e.g., Burton, 189 A.D.2d at 535-36, 597 N.Y.S.2d at 491 (requiring courts to\n“consider less drastic alternatives to sealing the records which would adequately serve the\ncompeting interests”); Maxim, Inc., 145 A.D.3d at 518, 43 N.Y.S.3d at 316 (“We recognize that\nit may be easier for the parties and the motion court to seal an entire court record, rather than\nmake a determination on a document by document basis about sealing, but administrative\nconvenience is not a compelling reason to justify sealing.”). In keeping with this State’s strong\npreference against wholesale sealing of documents, section 50-b expressly permits this Court to\nrelease judicial documents after ordering redactions “as it deems necessary . . . to preserve the\nconfidentiality of the identity of the victim.” N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b. Since the only\ninformation protected by the statute is identity of Epstein’s victims, the Post respectfully requests\nan order directing the District Attorney to redact only the names of Epstein’s victims.’\n\nSince the Post does not seek the names of victims of sexual abuse and agrees that these\nnames should be redacted before the appellate briefs are disclosed, there should be no need under\nthe statute to provide notice “to the victim or other person legally responsible for the care of the\nvictim.” N.Y. Civ. Rights Law § 50-b(2). But to the extent such notice is necessary, the Post is\nunable to notify any of the victims on its own because it has no knowledge of which victims (if\n\nany) may be identified in the requested documents. If the statute requires victims to be notified\n\n3 Without the benefit of reviewing the appellate briefs, the Post is not in a position to evaluate whether the briefs\ncontain other information that might identify Epstein’s victims, such as home addresses. While the Post would not\nobject to the District Attorney’s Office making good faith redactions of genuinely identifying information, these\nredactions should be narrowly tailored and no more expansive than is necessary to protect the victims’ identities.\n\n16\n4811-372 1-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016503",
