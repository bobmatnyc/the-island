Even though his plan faces long odds in Congress this year, the proposal will\nbecome a benchmark for tax policy.\n\nUnder current law, carried interest, or the profits share received by private equity managers, gets\ntreated as capital gains, with a top basic rate of 20 percent as opposed to the ordinary income rate of\n39.6 percent.\n\nObama and other Democrats have been trying since 2007 to change that law with little success. Camp is\nwrapping a change to carried interest inside a reconstruction of the tax code that would lower tax rates\nand broaden the tax base.\n\nSteve judge, president and chief executive officer of the Private Equity Growth Capital Council, an\nindustry trade group, said Camp's proposal was “disappointing.”\n\n“Key policy makers from both parties have already made clear that the discussion around this draft\nproposal will be brief,” Judge said in a statement Feb. 25. “Nevertheless, Chairman Camp's proposal\npenalizes long-term capital investment, which he and other members of the House Ways and Means\nCommittee have purported to support.”\n\nWith assistance from Richard Rubin in Washington.\nTo contact the reporter: Brett Ferguson in Washington at bferguson@bna.com\nTo contact the editor responsible for this story: Cheryl Saenz at csaenz@bna.com\n\nTexts of the discussion draft and the section-by-section summary are in TaxCore.\n\nContact us at http://www.bna.com/contact/index.html or call 1-800-372-1033\nISSN 1947-3923\n\nCopyright © 2014, The Bureau of National Affairs, Inc.
