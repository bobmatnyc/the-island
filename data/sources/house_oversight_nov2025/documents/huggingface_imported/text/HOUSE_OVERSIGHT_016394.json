  "text": "THE ARTISTIC USE OF CYBERNETIC BEINGS\nCaroline A. Jones\n\nCaroline A. Jones is a professor of art history in the Department of Architecture at MIT\nand author of Eyesight Alone: Clement Greenberg’s Modernism and the\nBureaucratization of the Senses; Machine in the Studio: Constructing the Postwar\nAmerican Artist; and The Global Work of Art.\n\nCybernated art is very important, but art for cybernated life is more important.\n— Nam June Paik, 1966\n\nArtificial intelligence was not what artists first wanted out of cybernetics, once Norbert\nWiener’s Zhe Human Use of Human Beings: Cybernetics and Society came out in 1950.\nThe range of artists who identified themselves with cybernetics in the fifties and sixties\ninitially had little access to “thinking machines.” Moreover, craft-minded engineers had\nalready been making turtles, jugglers, and light-seeking robot babes, not giant brains.\nUsing breadboards, copper wire, simple switches, and electronic sensors, artists followed\ncyberneticians in making sculptures and environments that simulated interactive\nsentience—analog movements and interfaces that had more to do with instinctive drives\nand postwar sexual politics than the automation of knowledge production. Now obscured\nby an ideology of a free-floating “intelligence” untethered by either hardware or flesh, AI\nhas forgotten the early days of cybernetics’ uptake by artists. Those efforts are worth\nrevisiting; they modeled relations with what the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and\nFélix Guattari have called the “machinic phylum,” having to do with how humans think\nand feel in bodies engaged with a physical, material, emotionally stimulating, and\nsignaling world.\n\nCybernetics now seems to have collapsed into an all-pervasive discourse of AI\nthat was far from preordained. “Cybernetics,” as a word, claimed postwar newness for\nconcepts that were easily four centuries old: notions of feedback, machine damping,\nbiological homeostasis, logical calculation, and systems thinking that had been around\nsince the Enlightenment (boosted by the Industrial Revolution). The names in this\nlineage include Descartes, Leibniz, Sadi Carnot, Clausius, Maxwell, and Watt. Wiener’s\ncoinage nonetheless had profound cultural effects.4”7 The ubiquity today of the prefix\n“cyber-” confirms the desire for a crisp signifier of the tangled relations between humans\nand machines. In Wiener’s usage, things “cyber” simply involved “control and\ncommunication in the animal and the machine.” But after the digital revolution, “cyber”\nmoved beyond servomechanisms, feedback loops, and switches to encompass software,\nalgorithms, and cyborgs. The work of cybernetically inclined artists concerns the\nemergent behaviors of life that elude AI in its current condition.\n\nAs to that original coinage, Wiener had reached back to the ancient Greek to\nborrow the word for “steersman” (kvBepvytns / kubernétés), a masculine figure\nchanneling power and instinct at the helm of a ship, who read the waves, judged the\nwind, kept a hand on the tiller, and directed the slaves as they mindlessly (mechanically)\nchurned their oars. The Greek had already migrated into modern English via Latin, going\n\n47 Wiener later had to admit the earlier coinage of the word in 1834 by André-Marie Ampére, who had\nintended it to mean the “science of government,” a concept that remained dormant until the 20th century.\n\n174\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016394",
