She could acknowledge that she\nunderstands that people want change, and ask for a clear majority in the senate thinking abou that instead of\npresidential elections. Then if she does bad in 4 years she is out, but she could make the public understand that\nsenate is key to show what a president can do.\n\nBut again, I know 0.001% of what you or them understands about politics, I am however worried that europe is\njust 5 or 10 years ahead on this trend compared to the US in anti-establishment feelings and I have seen with\nfriends how irrational and influenceable masses can become in voting when they are frustrated (Hitler was\nelected after all...)\n\nHope to see you soon!!!\n\nG\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032308",
