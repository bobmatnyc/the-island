  "text": "Less Is More: The Art of Voluntary Poverty—An Anthology of Ancient and Modern Voices in Praise\nof Simplicity (336 pages)\n\nEDITED BY GOLDIAN VANDENBROECK\n\nThis is a collection of bite-sized philosophies on simple living. I read it to learn how to do the most with\nthe least and eliminate artificial needs, not live like a monk—big difference. It incorporates actionable\nprinciples and short stories ranging from Socrates to Benjamin Franklin and the Bhagavad Gita to\nmodern economists.\n\nThe Monk and the Riddle: The Education of a Silicon Valley Entrepreneur (192 pages)\n\nBY RANDY KOMISAR\n\nThis great book was given to me by Professor Zschau as a graduation gift and introduced me to the\nphrase “deferred-life plan.” Randy, a virtual CEO and partner at the legendary Kleiner Perkins, has been\ndescribed as a “combined professional mentor, minister without portfolio, in-your-face investor, trouble-\nshooter and door opener.” Let a true Silicon Valley wizard show you how he created his ideal life using\nrazor-sharp thinking and Buddhist-like philosophies. I’ve met him—he’s the real deal.\n\nThe 80/20 Principle: The Secret to Success by Achieving More with Less (288 pages)\nBY RICHARD KOCH\n\nThis book explores the “nonlinear” world, discusses the mathematical and historical support for the 80/20\nPrinciple, and offers practical applications of the same.\n\nMuse Creation and Related Skills\n\nHarvard Business School Case Studies www.hbsp.harvard.edu (click on “school cases”’)\n\nOne of the secrets behind Harvard Business School’s teaching success is the case method—using real-life\ncase studies for discussion. These cases take you inside the marketing and operational plans of 24-Hour\nFitness, Southwest Airlines, Timberland, and hundreds of other companies. Few people realize that you\ncan purchase these case studies for less than $10 apiece instead of spending more than $100,000 to go to\nHarvard (not that the latter isn’t worth it). There is a case study for every situation, problem, and\nbusiness model.\n\n“This business has legs”: How I Used Infomercial Marketing to Create the $100,000,000 Thighmaster\nCraze: An Entrepreneurial Adventure Story (206 pages)\n\nBY PETER BIELER\n\nThis is the story of how a naive (in the best sense of the word) Peter Bieler started from scratch—no\nproduct, no experience, no cash—and created a $100-million merchandising empire in less than two\nyears. It is a mind-expanding and often hysterical case study that uses real numbers to discuss the fine\npoints of everything from dealing with celebrities to marketing, production, legal, and retail. Peter can\nnow finance the media purchases for your product: www.mediafunding.com.\n\nSecrets of Power Negotiating: Inside Secrets from a Master Negotiator (256 pages)\nBY ROGER DAWSON\n\nThis is the one negotiating book that really opened my eyes and gave me practical tools I could use\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014031",
