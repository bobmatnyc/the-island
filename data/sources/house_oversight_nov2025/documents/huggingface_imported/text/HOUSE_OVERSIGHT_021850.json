We will come back to your basis for that.\nI want to go back to the police report.\nWe've clarified it never says Professor Dershowitz\nabused anyone, correct?\n\nA. It doesn't say that directly, but the police\nreport is part of a larger package of information that I\nhad available to me since you asked on December 30th\nthat suggested that Mr. Dershowitz was involved in the\nabuse of minors.\n\nI'm sorry. Let me correct that. In the\nsexual abuse of minors, in particularly, minor girls.\n\nQ. Would it be your position that anyone who was\na friend, or a friend of Mr. Epstein who visited his\nhouse on more than a few occasions, that that's\nsufficient to conclude that -- to allege that they\n\nengaged in sexual abuse of minors?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. Are we talking about guilt by association\nhere?\n\nA. No. And that question requires a more\n\nextended answer, which I would be happy to provide for\nyou, if you would like an extended answer.\nQ. Let me ask you this question: You referred\n\nto the police report, correct?\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021850",
