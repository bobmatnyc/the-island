  "text": "174 Teaching Minds\n\nRule #1: A teacher should never tell a student anything that the\nteacher thinks is true. Now, on the surface this seems ridiculous.\nHow can you resist telling students the truth? Isn’t that your job as a\nteacher? No. It isn’t.\n\nWhy not?\n\nBecause, in general, students wouldn't believe you anyway. Stu-\ndents don’t take what teachers say as gospel. And, they tend not to\nremember what you say. I have taught many a class and asserted X\nonly to be told minutes later that I had asserted not X. People don’t\nlisten very well. So what is the point of saying true things, besides\nfeeling good about having said something wise? The point certainly\nisn’t teaching.\n\nHow will students learn what is true, then? By discovery. By fail-\nure. By repeated experience. By talking with people about what they\nthink and having to defend their claims. Not by listening to you.\n\nLet’s consider mistake #2.\n\nMistake #2: Believing that a teacher’s job is assessment\n\nWhat does this mean? In the real world, teaching and assessment\nare usually conjoined. Teachers teach and they also give grades and\ntest. This is a problem. It is a problem because satisfying the teacher\nbecomes a goal of the student that tends to supersede learning, and it\nis a problem because as the ultimate arbiter of truth, a teacher gets to\nsay what is true and students have to believe it. To fix this a teacher\nneeds to not be in this dual role.\n\nThis is easier said than done, of course. I used to tell students they\nwould get an Ano matter what they did as long as they handed in the\nwork that I asked for. This had the effect of having many students sign\nup for an easy A and having the administration become annoyed with\nhow many A’s I gave out. Both of these outcomes were entirely pre-\ndictable. But what I did, changed student behavior in the class greatly.\n\nThey often wrote about how much they wanted to please the\nteacher and how once I took that out of the equation, how much\nit changed their view as to why they were doing anything at all. For\nsome, it had a very bad effect. They just didn’t take the class seriously.\nOthers took it more seriously than ever because they were the judges\nof their own work. (I asked them to defend their viewpoints to the\nclass during class time so their friends were also judges.)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023920",
