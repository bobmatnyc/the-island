Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the\n\nSouth East corner of the property. This area of this structure was\nassigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the\nroom. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered\n\non Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The\n\nscreen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL\naddress of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active\nwindows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. The power\ncord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the\ncable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,\nmarked with Serial Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the\nevidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt.\n\nI also located several media related items within Room B, which were\nrecorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence\nCustodians.\n\nI then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a\nwhite in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer\ndesk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on.\nThe CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,\nwarning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active\nwindows in. the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed\nthe power cable from the back of the Premio CPU and shutdown all other\nmedia. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was\nsecured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic\nanalysis via property receipt. I also located several media related\nitems within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and\nturned over the Evidence Custodians.\n\nThis concluded my participation in the search of the residence.\n\nRRKEKEKEKEEKEREREEREEEEEERERK NARRATIVE He QQ KEKE KKEKKEKEKKEKEEE KEE KERR E\nNA Reported By: RECAREY, JOSEPH 12/21/05\nEntered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 12/21/05\n\nOn December 20, 2005, I contacted ASA Daliah Weiss in an attempt to\n\nsubpoena the Epstein former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez.
