But I was not alone in wondering whether it\nwas worth the price that she, Kadima, and the country would pay as a result: Bibi’s\nreturn as Prime Minister in a Likud-led coalition.\n\nThough I was not surprised when he asked me to remain as Defense Minister,\nand to keep Labor inside the coalition, that was not an easy argument to make to\nmy reduced Knesset contingent. They saw joining Bibi, especially in a government\nwith the right-wing Lieberman as Foreign Minister, as a betrayal of all the efforts\nthat they and I had made to achieve peace with the Palestinians. Still, the decision\non whether to join the coalition ultimately rested with the party central committee,\nalmost every one of whose members was on a local government council. For them,\nthe choice was between a share of power, however limited, and the wilderness of\nopposition. So we joined Bibi’s government.\n\nI was personally in favor of our doing so, but for more complicated reasons. I\nknew that Bibi’s background, his instincts and his undeniably powerful political\nrhetoric were all firmly rooted on the political right. I recognized that he was often\nmore interested in politics than policy, and perhaps above both of those, in the\ntactical maneuvering required to consolidate his political position. But I had known\nhim long enough to dismiss the suggestions of many of my colleagues that he was\nintellectually shallow. I felt he was capable of doing what was best for Israel, and\nthat he had a basic pragmatism that would guide how he got there. All that,\nhowever, was just a reason for not saying “no” when he asked me and Labor to\nstay on. The reason I felt it was right to say yes had to two with specific policy\nchallenges. The first was to ensure there at least some peace process with the\nPalestinians. But that, in turn, was in large part because I believed it would win us\nthe diplomatic support, especially from the Americans, needed to tackle a more\nurgent threat. It again involved an enemy state trying to get nuclear weapons. But\nnot Syria. The Islamic theocracy of Iran.\n\nWe’d been aware for a number of years about Iranian efforts to go nuclear. The\nMossad had notched up a series of successes in delaying the Iranians from getting\nthere. But they were getting inexorably closer. In fact, when I’d taken over as\nDefense Minister under Olmert, I formally directed the new chief-of-staff, Gaby\nAshknazi, to get to work on a plan to attack the most important facilities in the\nIranians’ nuclear network, with the aim of pushing back the point at which they\nmight develop a bomb by five to six years. But it became clear we didn’t have the\n\n408\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028256",
