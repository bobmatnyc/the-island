Regional Structural Changes Driving Alpha Opportunity\n\nStructural changes are occurring in all regions. Those in which Electron is currently investing or tracking closely\nare as follows:\n\ne §=6 US _ Utilities\n\nOf the global utility markets, we expect the US utilities market to face the strongest headwinds and be\nthe least-attractive market for alpha generation over the next 2 years. Since the financial crisis, the US\nhas been the best-performing region for utilities of all the developed markets, outperforming European\nutilities by 40% over the last 4 years, and it is the region which is only slightly underweight by investors.\n\nThe US is the most defensive of all regions because of the large weighting of regulated names. Since 2008,\nUS utility earnings have been flat (versus a -45% decline in Europe), as consistent regulated earnings\ngrowth of 3-5% offset unregulated utility earnings declines resulting from lower power prices driven by\nfalling natural gas prices. Notwithstanding flat earnings growth, investors have re-rated the US utility\nsector’s PE multiple relative to the S&P as they sought more yield in a low-yielding QE environment.\nToday, US utilities are close to the sector’s pre-crisis record valuation peak (trading at a 7% PE premium to\nthe S&P 500) when investors were discounting higher earnings growth from tightening power markets\n(see below).\n\n7 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024208",
