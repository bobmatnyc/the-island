  "text": "Hans Ulrich Obrist: Making the Invisible Visible: Art Meets AI\n\nMany contemporary artists are articulating various doubts about the promises of AI and\nreminding us not to associate the term “artificial intelligence” solely with positive\noutcomes.\n\nAlison Gopnik: AlIs versus Four-Year-Olds\nLooking at what children do may give programmers useful hints about directions for\ncomputer learning.\n\nPeter Galison: Algorists Dream of Objectivity\nBy now, the legal, ethical, formal, and economic dimensions of algorithms are all quasi-\ninfinite.\n\nGeorge M. Church: The Rights of Machines\nProbably we should be less concerned about us-versus-them and more concerned about\nthe rights of all sentients in the face of an emerging unprecedented diversity of minds.\n\nCaroline A. Jones: The Artistic Use of Cybernetic Beings\nThe work of cybernetically inclined artists concerns the emergent behaviors of life that\nelude AI in its current condition.\n\nStephen Wolfram: Artificial Intelligence and the Future of Civilization\n\nThe most dramatic discontinuity will surely be when we achieve effective human\nimmortality. Whether this will be achieved biologically or digitally isn’t clear, but\ninevitably it will be achieved.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016811",
