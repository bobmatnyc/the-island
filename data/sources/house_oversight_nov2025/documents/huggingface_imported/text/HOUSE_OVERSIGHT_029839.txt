Open in principle depending on specially how and where it would be shown and how it would be advertised-
both subject to particular requirements and/or restrictions.Also dependent on approval of final cut. Would enter
project with positive attitude but release would be reworked by lawyer.

Dear Jeffrey,

My name is Leah Reis-Dennis, and I'll be heading operations for Lisa's new non-profit, Verse Video Education.
She's asked me to be in touch with you about helping us get a release from Woody Allen.

First, I wanted to send along the rough stringout of footage from the conversation with Woody a couple of years
ago on "This is Just to Say" by William Carlos Williams. This is totally unedited and uncut footage, but we

would love the opportunity to turn it into something great.

If Woody Allen agrees to let us use the footage, he will be in distinguished company. To date, we have filmed
conversations about poetry with dozens of distinguished Americans including:

Bill Clinton

Al Gore

John McCain

Mayor Rahm Emanuel

Mayor Tom Menino

Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan

Sir Mervyn King

Former Secretary of the Treasury Larry Summers

The conversation would be part of a large multiplatform initiative that Harvard Professor Lisa New has under
way to bring poetry into the mainstream, and, especially, into English Language Arts classrooms in the United
States and around the world. The initiative, Poetry in America, includes a HarvardX online course, a television
series we're creating with WGBH to be paired with PBS LearningMedia segments for the classroom, and, a
series of online professional development courses we're creating for ELA Middle and High School teachers and
for their students.
