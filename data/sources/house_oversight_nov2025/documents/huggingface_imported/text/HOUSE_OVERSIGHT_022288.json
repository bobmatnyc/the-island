Accordingly, the Board does\nnot consider the number of times the\nBoard’s processes are invoked to be\npersuasive evidence that workers\ngenerally are aware of their NLRA\nrights.\n\nFinally, remarks in multiple opposing\ncomments strongly suggest that the\ncommenters themselves do not\nunderstand the basic provisions of the\nNLRA:\n\n—If my employees want to join a union they\nneed to look for a job in a union\ncompany.5?\n\n—la]nytime one of our independent\ntradesmen would like to join the union\nthey are free to apply and be hired by a\nunion contractor.\n\n—If a person so desires to be employed by\na union company, they should take their\nass to a union company and apply for a\nunion job.\n\n—Belonging to a union is a privilege and a\npreference—not a right.8?\n\n—If they don’t like the way I treat them, then\ngo get another job. That is what capitalism\nis about.84\n\ncited Professor Kate Bronfenbrenner’s doctoral\ndissertation, “Seeds of Resurgence: Successful\nUnion Strategies for Winning Certification Elections\nand First Contracts in the 1980s and Beyond,”\n(available at http://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/\ncgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1002&context=reports&\nsei-redir=1#search=“‘Kate+Bronfenbrenner,\n+Uneasy+terrain:+ Thet+\nimpact+of+capital+mobility+ont+\nworkers,+wages,tand+union’) to argue that the\nhigher win rates for unions in elections involving\nboth immigrant and older workers argued against\nthe need for the proposed rule.\n\nThe Board is not addressing the many debated\ncauses of the declining rates of private sector\nunionization in the United States. This rule simply\naccepts those rates as given, and seeks to increase\nthe knowledge of NLRA provisions among those\nwithout readily available sources of reliable\ninformation on these provisions.\n\n80 See, e.g., comment of Desert Terrace Healthcare\nCenter.\n\n81 See Bureau of Labor Statistics, Economic News\nRelease, Table B—1, “Employees on nonfarm\npayrolls by industry sector and selected industry\ndetail,” May 3, 2011 (seasonally adjusted data for\nMarch 2011) http://data.bis.gov/timeseries\nENS11300000?vears_option=specific_vears\nSinclude_graphs=true&to_vear=2010\n&from_vear=1948 (last visited June 6, 2011).\n\n52Comment of P & L Fire Protection, Inc.\n\n83 Comment of OKC Tea Party.\n\n84Comment of Montana Records Management,\nLLP.\n\n—We are not anti-union; but feel as\nAmericans, we must protect our right not\nto be signatory to a third party in our\nbusiness.85\n\n—If one desires to be a part of a union, he\nor she is free to apply to those companies\nthat operate with that form of\nrelationship.8\n\n—l also believe employees already have such\nnotice by understanding they retain the\nright to change employers whenever they\nso choose.87\n\nThese comments reinforce the Board’s\nbelief that, in addition to informing\nemployees of their NLRA rights so that\nthey may better exercise those rights,\nposting the notice may have the\nbeneficial side effect of informing\nemployers concerning the NLRA’s\nrequirements.®®\n\nAs to the contention that information\nconcerning unions is widely available\non the internet, including on the Board’s\nWeb site, the Board responds that not all\nemployees have ready access to the\ninternet. Moreover, it is reasonable to\nassume that an employee who has no\nidea that he or she has a right to join a\nunion, attempt to organize his\nemployer’s workforce, or engage in\nother protected concerted activities,\nwould be less likely to seek such\ninformation than one who is aware of\nsuch rights and wants to learn more\nabout them.?° The Board is pleased that\nit has received a large number of\ninquiries at its Web site seeking\ninformation concerning NLRA rights,\nbut it is under no illusion that that\ninformation will reach more than a\nsmall fraction of the workforce in the\nforeseeable future.\n\nSeveral comments assert that, in any\nevent, requiring the posting of notices\n\n85 Comment of Humphrey & Associates, Inc.\n\n86 Comment of Medina Excavating, Inc.\n\n87 Comment of Olsen Tool & Plastics, Co.\n\n88 And as one union official writes:\n\nHaving been active in labor relations for 30 years\nI can assure you that both employees and employers\nare confused about their respective rights under the\nNLRA. Even union officers often do not understand\ntheir rights. Members and non-members rarely\nunderstand their rights. Often labor management\ndisputes arise because one or both sides are mis-\ninformed about their rights. Often the employer\ntakes an action it truly believes is within its rights\nwhen it is not.\n\nComment of Civil Service Employees Association.\n\n89 Thus, the many comments that assert that\nemployees can just use Internet search engines to\nfind out about unions (see, e.g., comments of\nWinseda Corp. Homestead Village, Inc.},\nmisapprehend the breadth of the rights of which the\nBoard seeks to apprise all employees. As stated\nabove, Section 7 is not merely about the right to join\nor refrain from joining a labor organization, but\nmore broadly protects the right of employees to\nengage in ‘concerted activities” for the purpose of\n“mutual aid or protection.” It is this right that is\nthe most misunderstood and simply not subject to\nan easy Internet search by employees who may have\nno idea of what terms to use, or even that sucha\nright might be protected at all.\n\nwill not be effective in informing\nemployees of their rights, because\nemployees will simply ignore the\nnotices, as the comments contend they\nignore other workplace postings.\n“Posters are an ineffective means of\neducating workers and are rarely read\nby employees.” 9° Other comments\nargue that adding one more notice to the\nmany that are already mandated under\nother statutes will simply create more\n“visual clutter” that contributes to\nemployees’ disinclination to pay\nattention to posted notices. As one\nemployer stated, ‘““My bulletin boards\nare filled with required notifications\nthat nobody reads. In the past 15 years,\nnot one of our 200 employees has ever\nasked about any of these required\npostings. I have never seen anyone ever\nread one of them.” %! Another wrote,\n“Employers are already required to post\nso many notices that these notices have\nlost any semblance of effectiveness as a\ngovernmental communication channel.”\n\nTo these comments, the Board\nresponds that the experiences of the\ncommenters is apparently not universal;\nother comments cited above contend\nthat employees are more knowledgeable\nabout their rights under statutes\nrequiring the posting of notices\nsummarizing those rights than about\ntheir NLRA rights. Moreover, not every\nemployee has to read workplace notices\nfor those notices to be effective. If only\none employee of a particular employer\nreads the Board’s notice and conveys\nwhat he or she has read to the other\nemployees, that may be enough to pique\ntheir interest in learning more about\ntheir NLRA rights. In addition, the\nBoard is mandating electronic notice to\nemployees on an internet or intranet\nsite, when the employer customarily\ncommunicates with its employees about\npersonnel rules or policies in that way,\nin order to reach those who read paper\nnotices and those who read electronic\npostings. As for the comment that\nargues that the Board can use public\nservice announcements or advertising to\nreach employees, the Board believes\nthat it makes much more sense to seek\nto reach directly the persons to whom\nthe Act applies, in the location where\nthey are most likely to hear about their\nother employment rights, the\nworkplace.9\n\n28° Comment of Riverbend Community Mental\nHealth.\n\n®1Comment of Farmers Cooperative Compress.\n\n®2 Printing Industries of America uses election\ndata to argue that the Labor Department’s notice\nposting rule for Federal contractors has not been\neffective because the rate of elections has not\nincreased. It is unclear whether any meaningful\nconclusion can be drawn from election data for only\n\nContinued\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022288",
