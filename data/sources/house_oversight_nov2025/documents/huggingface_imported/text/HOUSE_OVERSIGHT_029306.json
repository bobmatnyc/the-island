Perry (CA-9, Feb. 7, 2012),\nwhich addressed whether the equal protec-\ntion clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to\nthe Constitution prohibits California from\ndefining marriage as the union of a man and\nwoman. The Supreme Court heard oral ar-\nguments in both cases in March 2013.\n\nIRS Denies Estate Tax Marital Deduction.\nIn Windsor, a long-time same-sex couple\nmarried in Canada in 2007. They had previ-\nously registered as domestic partners in New\nYork City, where they made their home. One\nspouse died in 2009. Because of DOMA, the\nsurvivor did not qualify for the unlimited\nmarital deduction under the Internal Revenue\nCode and as a result, the executor of the estate\npaid $363,000 in federal estate tax that was\nnot otherwise due. The survivor as executor\nand sole beneficiary filed a refund claim under\nCode Sec. 2056(a) (under which property of\na surviving spouse generally passes free of fed-\neral estate tax). The IRS determined that the\nsurvivor was not a spouse under Section 3 of\nDOMA and, therefore, not a surviving spouse\nunder Code Sec. 2056(a). A federal district\ncourt found that Section 3 of DOMA violated\nthe equal protection clause of the Fourteenth\nAmendment because there was no rational\nbasis to support it. The Second Circuit Court\nof Appeals affirmed the lower’s court decision,\nfinding that homosexuals are a protected class\nand that Section 3 of DOMA was not sub-\nstantially related to an important government\ninterest and violated Equal Protection.\n\nSUPREME COURT'S\nHOLDINGS\n\nWriting for the majority in Windsor, Justice\nKennedy found that DOMA had departed\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nfrom the long standing tradition and his-\ntory of reliance on state law to define mar-\nriage. The State of New York had recognized\nthe validity of same-sex marriages, which\nresulted in a status that “is a far-reaching\nlegal acknowledgment of the intimate rela-\ntionship between two people, a relationship\ndeemed by the State worthy of dignity in the\ncommunity equal with all other marriages,”\nKennedy wrote. He reasoned that DOMA\nsought to injure this class of persons whom\nNew York sought to protect, and by doing so\nviolated basic due process and equal protec-\ntion principles applicable to the federal gov-\nernment and was therefore unconstitutional.\n\n“The decision opens the\ndoor for same-sex couples\nto enjoy many tax-related\n\nbenefits previously\navailable only to opposite-\nsex couples.”\n\nDOMA’s operation in practice, Kennedy\ncontinued, was to treat same-sex marriages as\nsecond-class marriages for purposes of federal\nlaw “by imposing a system-wide enactment\nwith no identified connection to any particu-\nlar area of federal law.” DOMAs principal\npurpose was to impose inequality, not for\nother reasons such as governmental efficien-\ncy, Kennedy held. Therefore, the majority\nfound DOMA invalid for lack of a legitimate\ngovernment purpose that could overcome\nthe burden on those within the class whose\npersonhood and dignity New York had\n\nsought to protect through its marriage laws.\n\nCOMMENT: The majority opinion\nlisted numerous ways in which DOMA\ninfringed upon the dignity of same-sex\ncouples. Among these is financial harm\ncaused by DOMA to children of same-sex\ncouples by raising the cost of health care\nfor families by taxing health benefits pro-\nvided by employers to their workers’ same-\nsex spouses. Another example, Kennedy\nwrote, is that DOMA denies or reduces\n\nbenefits allowed to families upon the loss\nof a spouse and parent, benefits that are\nan integral part of family security.\n\nCOMMENT: Justice Kennedy qualified\nthe majoritys ruling at the end of the de-\ncision, stating that its applicability was\n“confined to those lawful marriages,”\nmeaning those recognized by the states\nthat currently allow same-sex marriag-\nes. Kennedy observed that Section 2 of\nDOMA, which allows States to refuse to\nrecognize same-sex marriages performed\nunder the laws of other States, had not\nbeen challenged in Windsor and contin-\nues to be the law. On June 26, House\nDemocrats introduced legislation to re-\n\npeal Section 2 of DOMA.\n\nCalifornia’s Proposition 8. On the same day\nthe Supreme Court announced its decision in\nWindsor, the Justices ruled, 5-4 (but with a dif\nferent mix of Justices for and against), to send\nHollingsworth back to the California courts\nrather than to directly decide on the constitu-\ntionality of Californias ban on same-sex mar-\nriage. There, the Supreme Court held that the\npetitioners did not have the standing to chal-\nlenge the lower court’s decision throwing out\nProposition 8, which denied same-sex couples\nthe right to marry in California. This decision\npaves the way for same-sex marriage to begin\nagain in California sometime in late July.\n\nFEDERAL TAX\nCONSEQUENCES\n\nUnder federal income tax rules, same-sex\nmarried couples can now presumably enjoy\nbenefits that had been unavailable to them\nbecause of DOMA. On the other hand, cer-\ntain strategic advantages previously enjoyed\nby same-sex married couples who filed as\nsingle individuals under the federal tax laws,\nhave now likewise ended.\n\nCOMMENT. Aside from the fact that it\nwas a federal tax refund claim in Wind-\nsor that triggered the litigation that found\nitself before the U.S. Supreme Court, the\nopinion focused on Constitutional rights\nand privileges, without any technical\n\n©2013 CCH Incorporated.
