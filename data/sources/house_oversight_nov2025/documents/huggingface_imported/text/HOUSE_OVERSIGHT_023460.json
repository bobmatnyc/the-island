They see a heightened\npossibility of actual military conflict in the Gulf, where one-fifth of\nthe world's oil supplies traverse the shipping lanes between Saudi\nArabia and Iran. Growing hostility between the two countries could\nmake it more difficult for the U.S. to exit smoothly from Iraq this\nyear, as planned. And, perhaps most dire, it could exacerbate what\nmany fear is a looming nuclear arms race in the region.\n\nIran has long pursued a nuclear program that it insists is solely for the\npeaceful purpose of generating power, but which the U.S. and Saudi\nArabia believe is really aimed at producing a nuclear weapon. At a\nrecent security conference, Prince Turki al Faisal, a former head of\nthe Saudi intelligence service and ambassador to the U.K. and the\nU.S., pointedly suggested that if Iran were to develop a weapon,\nSaudi Arabia might well feel pressure to develop one of its own.\n\nThe Saudis currently rely on the U.S. nuclear umbrella and on\nantimissile defense systems deployed throughout the Persian Gulf\nregion. The defense systems are intended to intercept Iranian ballistic\nmissiles that could be used to deliver nuclear warheads. Yet even\nSaudis who virulently hate Iran have a hard time believing that the\nIslamic Republic would launch a nuclear attack against the birthplace\nof their prophet and their religion. The Iranian leadership says it has\nrenounced the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nHow a string of hopeful popular protests has brought about a\nshowdown of regional superpowers is a tale as convoluted as the\nalliances and history of the region. It shows how easily the old\nMiddle East, marked by sectarian divides and ingrained rivalries, can\nre-emerge and stop change in its tracks.\n\nThere has long been bad blood between the Saudis and Iran. Saudi\nArabia is a Sunni Muslim kingdom of ethnic Arabs, Iran a Shiite\nIslamic republic populated by ethnic Persians. Shiites first broke with\nSunnis over the line of succession after the death of the Prophet\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023460",
