  "text": "HERBIE HANCOCK\n\nHerbie Hancock is a true icon of modern music. Throughout\nhis explorations, he has transcended limitations and\n\ngenres while maintaining his unmistakable voice. With an\nillustrious career spanning five decades and 14 Grammy®\nAwards, including Album of the Year for River: The Joni\nLetters, he continues to amaze audiences across the globe.\n\nThere are few artists in the music industry\nwho have had more influence on acoustic and electronic\njazz and R&B than Herbie Hancock. As the immortal\nMiles Davis said in his autobiography, “Herbie was\nthe step after Bud Powell and Thelonious Monk, and I\nhaven’t heard anybody yet who has come after him.”\n\nBorn in Chicago in 1940, Herbie was a child\npiano prodigy who performed a Mozart piano concerto\nwith the Chicago Symphony Orchestra at age 11. He\nbegan playing jazz in high school, initially influenced\nby Oscar Peterson and Bill Evans. He also developed a\npassion for electronics and science, and double-majored\nin music and electrical engineering at Grinnell College.\n\nIn 1960, Herbie was discovered by trumpeter Donald\nByrd. After two years of session work with Byrd as well as\nPhil Woods and Oliver Nelson, he signed with Blue Note\nas a solo artist. His 1963 debut album, ‘Takin’ Off’, was an\nimmediate success, producing the hit “Watermelon Man.”\n\nIn 1963, Miles Davis invited Herbie to join the\nMiles Davis Quintet. During his five years with Davis, Herbie\nand his colleagues Wayne Shorter (tenor sax), Ron Carter\n(bass), and Tony Williams (drums) recorded many classics,\nincluding ‘ESP’, ‘Nefertiti’ and ‘Sorcerer’. Later on, Herbie\nmade appearances on Davis’ groundbreaking ‘In a Silent Way’\nand ‘Bitches Brew’, which heralded the birth of jazz-fusion.\n\nHerbie’s own solo career blossomed on Blue Note,\nwith classic albums including ‘Maiden Voyage’, ‘Empyrean\nIsles’, and “Speak Like a Child’. He composed the score to\nMichelangelo Antonioni’s 1966 film ‘Blow Up’, which led to\na successful career in feature film and television music.\n\nAfter leaving Davis, Herbie put together a new\nband called The Headhunters and, in 1973, recorded ‘Head\nHunters.’ With its crossover hit single “Chameleon,”\nit became the first jazz album to go platinum.\n\nBy mid-decade, Herbie was playing for stadium-sized\ncrowds all over the world and had no fewer than four albums in\nthe pop charts at once. In total, Herbie had 11 albums in the pop\ncharts during the 1970s. His ’7o0s output inspired and provided\nsamples for generations of hip-hop and dance music artists.\n\nHerbie also stayed close to his love of acoustic\njazz in the ’7os, recording and performing with VSOP\n(reuniting him with his Miles Davis colleagues), and in\nduet settings with Chick Corea and Oscar Peterson.\n\nIn 1980, Herbie introduced the trumpeter Wynton\nMarsalis to the world as a solo artist, producing his debut\nalbum and touring with him as well. In 1983, a new pull to the\nalternative side led Herbie to a series of collaborations with\n\nBill Laswell. The first, ‘Future Shock’, again struck platinum,\nand the single “Rockit” rocked the dance and R&B charts,\nwinning a Grammy for Best R&B Instrumental. The video of\nthe track won five MTV awards. ‘Sound System’, the follow-up,\nalso received a Grammy in the R&B instrumental category.\n\nHerbie won an Oscar in 1986 for scoring the\nfilm “’Round Midnight”, in which he also appeared as\nan actor. Numerous television appearances over the\nyears led to two hosting assignments in the 1980s: “Rock\nSchool” on PBS and Showtime’s “Coast To Coast”.\n\nAfter an adventurous 1994 project for Mercury\nRecords, ‘Dis Is Da Drum’, he moved to the Verve label,\nforming an all-star band to record 1996’s Grammy-\nwinning ‘The New Standard’. In 1997, an album of\nduets with Wayne Shorter, ‘1+1’, was released.\n\nThe legendary Headhunters reunited in 1998,\nrecording an album for Herbie’s own Verve-distributed\nimprint, and touring with the Dave Matthews Band. That\nyear also marked the recording and release of ‘“Gershwin’s\nWorld’, which included collaborators Joni Mitchell, Stevie\nWonder, Kathleen Battle, the Orpheus Chamber Orchestra,\nWayne Shorter and Chick Corea. ‘Gershwin’s World’ won three\nGrammys in 1999, including Best Traditional Jazz Album\nand Best R&B Vocal Performance for Stevie Wonder’s\n“St. Louis Blues.”\n\nHerbie reunited with Bill Laswell to collaborate\nwith some young hip-hop and techno artists on\n2001's FUTURE2FUTURE. He also joined with Roy\nHargrove and Michael Brecker in 2002 to record a live\nconcert album, ‘Directions In Music: Live at Massey\nHall’, a tribute to John Coltrane and Miles Davis.\n\n‘Possibilities’, released in August 2005, teamed\nHerbie with many popular artists, such as Sting, Annie Lennox,\nJohn Mayer, Christina Aguilera, Paul Simon, Carlos Santana,\nJoss Stone and Damien Rice. That year, he played a number\nof concert dates with a re-staffed Headhunters,\nand became the first-ever Artist-In-Residence at\nthe Tennessee-based festival Bonnaroo.\n\nIn 2007, Hancock recorded and released ‘River: The\nJoni Letters’, a tribute to longtime friend and collaborator Joni\nMitchell featuring Wayne Shorter, guitarist Lionel Loueke,\nbassist Dave Holland and drummer Vinnie Colaiuta and co-\nproduced by Larry Klein. He enlisted vocalists Norah Jones,\nTina Turner, Corinne Bailey Rae, Luciana Souza, Leonard\nCohen and Mitchell herself to perform songs she wrote or was\ninspired by. The album received glowing reviews and was a\nyear-end Top 10 choice for many critics. It also garnered three\nGrammy Awards, including Album of the Year; Herbie is one\nof only a handful of jazz musicians ever to receive that honor.\n\nIn 2010 Hancock released the critically-acclaimed\nCD, ‘Herbie Hancock’s The Imagine Project,’ winner of two\n2oll Grammy Awards for Best Pop Collaboration and Best\nImprovised Jazz Solo. Utilizing the universal language of\n\nmusic to express its central themes of peace and global\nresponsibility, the ‘Imagine’ project was recorded around\nthe world and features a stellar group of musicians\nincluding Jeff Beck, Seal,Pink, Dave Matthews, The\nChieftains, Lionel Loueke, Oumou Sangare, Konono\n\n#1, Anoushka Shankar, Chaka Khan, Marcus Miller,\nDerek Trucks, Susan Tedeschi, Tinariwen, and Ceu.\n\nHerbie Hancock also maintains a thriving career\noutside the performing stage and recording studio. Recently\nnamed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic as Creative Chair\nFor Jazz, he currently also serves as Institute Chairman of the\nThelonious Monk Institute of Jazz, the foremost international\norganization devoted to the development of jazz performance\nand education worldwide. Hancock is also a founder of\nThe International Committee of Artists for Peace, and was\nrecently awarded the much esteemed “Commandeur des Arts\net des Lettres” by French Prime Minister Francois Fillon.\n\nIn July of 2011 Hancock was designated a UNESCO\nGoodwill Ambassador by UNESCO Director-General Irina\nBokova. Recognizing Herbie Hancock’s “dedication to the\npromotion of peace through dialogue, culture and the arts,”\nthe Director-General has asked the celebrated jazz musician\n“to contribute to UNESCO’s efforts to promote mutual\nunderstanding among cultures, with a particular emphasis on\nfostering the emergence of new and creative ideas amongst\nyouth, to find solutions to global problems, as well as ensuring\nequal access to the diversity of artistic expressions.” UNESCO's\nGoodwill Ambassadors are an outstanding group of celebrity\nadvocates who have generously accepted to use their talent\nand status to help focus the world’s attention on the objectives\nand aims of UNESCO’s work in its fields of competence:\neducation, culture, science and communication/information\n\nNow in the fifth decade of his professional life,\nHerbie Hancock remains where he has always been: in the\nforefront of world culture, technology, business and music.\nThough one can’t track exactly where he will go next, he is\nsure to leave his inimitable imprint wherever he lands.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017541",
