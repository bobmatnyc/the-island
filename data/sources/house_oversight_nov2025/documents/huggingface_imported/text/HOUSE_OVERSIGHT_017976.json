  "text": "Even from jail, Jeffrey Epstein manipulated the system | Miami Herald Page 13 of 17\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 14 of 18\n\nThe girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what they regard as a gross injustice, while\nEpstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution agreement have prospered.\n\nBy\n\nTaking a page from Epstein’s legal team, lawyers representing Epstein’s victims hired private investigators and former police detectives to dig into\nEpstein’s life. Over the past decade, they’ve tracked down hundreds of people, including dozens of other potential victims; they’ve interviewed Epstein’s\nrecruiters, bookkeepers, housekeepers, butlers, pilots and drivers. They’ve traveled around the country and the world, taking statements and sworn\ndepositions, coaxing people to talk who had previously been too reticent to come forward.\n\nIn short, they did what criminal prosecutors didn’t do.\n\nSome of the information they ’ve learned was given to federal authorities in New York. Edwards said those authorities have shown no interest in opening a\nnew investigation focused on crimes he is alleged to have committed in that state, where he is listed as a level 3 sex offender, the most dangerous\ncategory, considered at risk to re-offend, records show. In New York, he has to register every 90 days.\n\n‘\nVirginia Roberts holds a photo of herself at age 16, when she says Palm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein began abusing her sexually. Emily Michot\nEMICHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM\n\nHolding abusers accountable\n\nIn 2015, Roberts sued Maxwell for defamation in New York after Maxwell called her a liar in a news interview. The civil lawsuit was an effort by Roberts\nnot just to clear her name, but an attempt to prove that Epstein and Maxwell operated an international underage sex trafficking operation. The lawsuit\nwas settled out of court in 2017 and nearly all the evidence presented in the case has been sealed.\n\nRoberts’ attorney, Sigrid McCawley, claims that Roberts received a sizable settlement, although the amount is confidential.\n\n“She wanted to hold her abusers accountable and we were able to do that by bringing this case ... which we ultimately settled very successfully for her,”\nsaid McCawley, an associate of noted Bush-Gore recount lawyer David Boies, who has also pursued cases against Epstein in federal court in New York.\n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article2 19494920 html 4/3/2019\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017976",
