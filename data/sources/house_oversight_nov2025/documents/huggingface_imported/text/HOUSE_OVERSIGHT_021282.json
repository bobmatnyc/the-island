  "text": "something like inclusive fitness and kin\naltruism?\n\nLet me start with Aquinas. In the\n“Supplement” to his Summa Theologica\nI,\n\nThomas follows Aristotle and the\nRoman natural-law theorist Ulpian in\nasserting that humans share with all\nanimals an inclination to have offspring.\n'° Having said this, he then introduces a\nvery modern sounding commentary on\nthe uniqueness to humans of the long\nperiod of infant dependency. Notice the\nsimilarity of his argument to the words\nof Cacioppo above. Aquinas writes,\n\nYet nature does not incline thereto in\nthe same way in all animals; since\nthere are animals whose offspring\nare able to seek food immediately\nafter birth, or are sufficiently fed by\ntheir mother; and in these there is no\ntie between male and female;\nwhereas in those whose offspring\nneeding the support of both parents,\nalthough for a short time, there is a\ncertain tie, as may be seen in certain\nbirds. In man, however, since the\nchild needs the parents’ care for a\nlong time, there is a very great tie\nbetween male and female, to which\ntie even the generic nature inclines. *°\n\nAlthough there is in this quote a\ndescription of how family formation\nemerges at the human level, there is an\nimplicit argument for both the fact of\nhuman infant dependency and what we\ntoday call inclusive fitness as well. But\nthese ideas are even more evident in the\nnext quote, although stated very much\nfrom the male point of view, a habit\ntypical of his time. Aquinas says, “Since\nthe natural life which cannot be\npreserved in the person of an undying\n\nPage | 36\n\nfather is preserved, by a kind of\nsuccession, in the person of the son, it is\nnaturally befitting that the son succeed in\nthe things belonging to the father.” 7!\nAquinas’s main source for this insight\nwas Aristotle’s Politics. In one place\nAristotle wrote, “ In common with other\nanimals and with plants, mankind have a\nnatural desire to leave behind them an\nimage of themselves.” ”\n\nHowever, in both Aristotle and\nAquinas, such claims were not just about\nthe importance of kin continuity, they\nwere statements about the origin and\nneed of long-term investments by\nparents at the human level. In contrast\nto his teacher Plato who, in his Republic,\nhad advocated removing children from\ntheir biological parents in an effort to\novercome the civil frictions created by\nnepotism, ~ Aristotle counters with an\nassertion about the origins of human\ncare. Aristotle wrote, “That which is\ncommon to the greatest number has the\nleast care bestowed upon it.” He\nbelieved that in Plato’s state, “love will\nbe watery....Of the two qualities which\nchiefly inspire regard and affection —\nthat a thing is your own and that it is\nyour only one — neither can exist in such\na state as this.”** This is an assertion\nabout the importance of kin altruism in\nhuman care.\n\nAlthough Aquinas saw these\nnatural inclinations as important for the\nformation of long-term human care, he\nbelieved that they were not sufficient for\nmature parental love. Powerful social,\ncultural, and indeed religious\nreinforcements were also necessary for\nstable parental investment to be realized.\nThis, once again, is due, according to\nAquinas, because of the many long years\nof human childhood dependency; human\nchildren need their parents for a very\nlong period of time and over the course\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021282",
