  "text": "PREFACE\n\nACPMM, Wolfson College, Cambridge\n\n‘A man may have twenty years\nof experience, or one year of\nexperience twenty times.”\n\nMike Sharman\n\n“Rules are for the obedience of\nfools and the guidance of wise\nmen.\n\nDouglas Bader\n\nam an inventor. I’ve always been an inventor. Ever since childhood\n\nI’ve tinkered with electronics and computers, taking things apart\n\nand putting them back together. There is no academic course\nfor inventing, so I had to choose my own path through school and\nUniversity. I studied design, physics and mathematics at secondary\nschool, and engineering and management at University. Part of that time\nwas spent in the Engineering Department of Cambridge University on a\nparticularly special course.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015683",
