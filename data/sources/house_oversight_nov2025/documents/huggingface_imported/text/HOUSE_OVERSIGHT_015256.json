  "text": "“To understand humanity,” Icke continued, “you have really got\nto understand humanists reptilian past, reptilian inherited genetics. One of\nthe most ancient parts of the human brain is known by science as the R\ncomplex, for reptilian brain. We get these traits—cold-blooded behavior,\nritualistic behavior, desire for top-down power over structures. Now,\ndismiss the reptilian thing—let’ s just think they don’ t exist—I have just\ndescribed the basic mentality of the Illuminati that allows wars to be\ncreated, millions of casualties without any emotional attachment to\nconsequences. Why do people who have more money than they could\nspend in a thousand lifetimes go on accumulating it? Why do corporations\nthat have enormous power and control over vast areas go on\naccumulating and seeking more and more power and control?”\n\nSo, then, is this whole reptilian agenda really just a metaphor for the\nvarieties of human cruelty? Or does Icke mean it all literally?\n\nPreviously, Jordan Maxwell had told the audience, “I think the\ndirtiest, the filthiest, the most licentious people on the face of the earth are\nthe British royalty. They represent in the human race all that is evil and all\nthat is filthy and degenerate. And that’ s why Princess Diana is dead.”\nThat there was a conspiracy behind Diana’ s death seems to be a given\n\namong this crowd: the royal bloodline protected by the paparazzi.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015256",
