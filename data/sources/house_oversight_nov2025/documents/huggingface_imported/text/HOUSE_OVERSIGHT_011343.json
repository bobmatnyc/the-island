Judge\nMarra referred to the first of the nine reasons. We have eight\nother additional reasons why those were included. It would\n\nessentially, again, be a mini trial about, well, what does a\n\njoinder motion mean? Did you file under Rule 15? It should\n\nhave been under Rule 21.

The jury's trying\nto figure out, well, what's going on in the Crime Victims\nRights Act case when the issue is whether or not Ms. Giuffre\ndefamed.\n\nNow, there is an issue in their pleadings.
