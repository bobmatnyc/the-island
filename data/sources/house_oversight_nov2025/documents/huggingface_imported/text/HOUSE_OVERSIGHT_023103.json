Page 2 of 5\n\nSometimes their reaction is denial, sometimes shock and horror, sometimes anger, but it’s\nalways dramatic. The mission at a minimum is to get the client to understand what’s\nhappening so that he can be effective for me, in terms of my defending him.\n\nLD: Have you ever declined to represent someone because you were so appalled by what\nthey did?\n\nRW: At this point, I’m in the fortunate position of turning down more cases than | take. | turn\ndown cases for many reasons, though it’s not so much that I’m appalled by the behavior.\n\nThe way | look at it is, do | bring value? Is there something about me representing the\nindividual that adds something, as opposed to every other lawyer in town? | think if | halted,\nor | was so shocked or appalled or dismayed by the conduct that I’d pull my punches, |’d\nknow that.\n\n| break bread with the would-be client. If there’s a visceral feel, either overtly or covertly, that\nI’m not going to want to spend time with him or her, it all factors in. There are often a variety\nof factors that cause me to take seriously the potential of the representation, and then | turn\n\nit down.\n\nLD: Are conflicts much of an issue?\n\nRW: Steptoe & Johnson is a big firm, but it’s not one of the megafirms. There have probably\nbeen a dozen significant matters | got conflicted out of because of Steptoe’s other\nrepresentations.

If | had nothing but Goldman-like representations, that would be an issue. But if you\nrepresent Jesse Jackson Jr. or [other] public officials, as | do, the potential for conflicts is\nsignificantly less.\n\nLD: What agency is most likely to strike fear in the heart of defendants?\n\nRW: The Southern District of New York is the elite prosecutor’s office in the country. | don’t\nthink you’d get much dispute there. They’re aggressive, they’re smart, they have this\nenormous home court advantage. Right after them, there are several very fine, very\naggressive, very talented U.S. attorneys offices like Chicago, Boston, EDVA and certainly\nthe District of Columbia. And you can go to Topeka, Kansas, or Burlington, Vermont, and\nfind a federal prosecutor who is very smart, has a good case and is talented in court.\n\nIn the Justice Department itself, there’s the Criminal Division, and the two litigating\nsections—the public integrity section, where | was for 10 years, and the fraud section.\nThey’ve had their ups and downs. As a defense attorney dealing with both sections\nregularly, you can have your hands full with either.\n\nLD: Some of the people you’ve represented have been so high-profile. How much of a\nchallenge is jury selection, and how do you handle it?\n\nRW: By way of example, in my most recent trial | went down to New Orleans. | represented\nthe former head of exploration for BP, who was accused of lying to Congress about how\n\nhttp://www litigationdaily.com/printerfriendly/id=1202736534962 9/8/2015\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023103",
