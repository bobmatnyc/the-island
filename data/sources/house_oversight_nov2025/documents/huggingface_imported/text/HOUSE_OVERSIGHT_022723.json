It’s a catch-22: How cana\ngirl not old enough to vote be a prostitute? And yet, many girls not old\nenough to vote are prostitutes.\n\nCompounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his\ncarefully constructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems\nnot just ill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping\nabout (i.e. he’s totally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and\nfound him weighing the conflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and\negomaniacal lawyers (along with Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal\nattorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and Clinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the\nday—anyone with new advice, Epstein seemed to hire—as well as a catchall\nof the leading crisis managers, who he seemed to retain at will, all wrangling\nfor fees and primacy.\n\nCertainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem\nto involve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens\nto prosecute him (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and\nvarious friends, associates, and lovers, or offers an ass-backwards\nsort of deal in which Epstein’s lawyers have to go to the Palm Beach\nauthorities and get them to agree to charge him with an offense that\nwill send him to jail and get him a sex offender status. Except that a\nsolicitation charge won't produce that result. Therefore he has to\nagree also to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has\npaid money, not received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s\nmore, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the girls who\nwant to sue him—and, not to defend himself from their suits—forcing\nhim to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high 6-figure\nsums or more.\n\nHe’s sentence to jail in 2008 for 18 months and serves 13 (while\nEpstein is now frequently accused of somehow managing to cut short\nhis sentence, almost all Florida prisoners serve only 70% of their\nofficially sentenced time).\n\nThis hardly ends the legal catch all.
