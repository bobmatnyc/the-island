  "text": "the ruling BJP has not a single Muslim MP among its cohort of 282;\nMuslims are reckoned to comprise at least 14% of the Indian population.\n\nBut largely Mr Modi told the truth: the BJP’s manifesto and Mr Modi’s\nspeeches emphasised economic and development matters. The victory he\nachieved is more the result of his talk of strong government and\nimprovements to the material lives of voters than anything else. That is\nencouraging. It suggests that he will now seek to govern in a way that\nencourages economic growth, job creation and better infrastructure, along\nwith further reductions in poverty and inflation. Mr Modi has been\ndropping strong hints that he hopes to remain in power not only for the\ncurrent five-year term, but to win re-election and reshape India’s economy\nand political landscape.

With Mr Modi having been an activist member in the right-wing\nRashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS) since he was a boy, some on the\nright have expectations that he will pursue an agenda of Hindutva (for\nexample getting a temple erected in Ayodhya, or changing the\nconstitutional status of Muslim-majority Kashmir).
