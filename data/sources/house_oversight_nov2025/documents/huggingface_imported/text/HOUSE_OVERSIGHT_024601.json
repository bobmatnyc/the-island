It is a relief to see so many articles and\nstatements reflecting lessons learnt from Iraq. But the Libyans are far\nahead of where the US was when the initial fighting ended in Iraq.\nThe National Transitional Council has a draft constitutional charter\nthat is impressive in scope, aspirations and detail — including 37\narticles on rights, freedoms and governance arrangements.\n\nThe sceptics’ response to all this, of course, is that it is too early to\ntell. In a year, or a decade, Libya could disintegrate into tribal\nconflict or Islamist insurgency, or split apart or lurch from one\nstrongman to another. But the question for those who opposed the\nintervention is whether any of those things is worse than Col Gaddafi\nstaying on by increasingly brutal means for many more years.\nInstability and worse would follow when he died, even had he\norchestrated a transition.\n\nThe sceptics must now admit that the real choice in Libya was\nbetween temporary stability and the illusion of control, or fluidity and\nthe ability to influence events driven by much larger forces. Welcome\nto the tough choices of foreign policy in the 21st century. Libya\nproves the west can make those choices wisely after all.\n\nThe writer is a former director of policy planning for the US state\ndepartment\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024601",
