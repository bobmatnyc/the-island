Hoffman et al.\n\nSo even when a witness knows that the perpetrator anticipated the harm, the witness\nbelieves other witnesses will not be aware of this and will presume the harm was not\nanticipated by the perpetrators. For instance, suppose we observe Israel killing civil-\nians as a by-product of a strategic raid on Hamas militants. Even if we knew Israel\nhad intelligence that confirmed the presence of civilians, we might not be sure oth-\ners were privy to this information. On the other hand, when the harm is done as a\nmeans, the harm must be anticipated, since otherwise the perpetrator would have no\nmotive to commit the act. Why would Hamas fire rockets at civilian towns with no\nmilitary presence if Hamas does not anticipate a chance of civilian casualties?\nConsequently, it is Nash equilibrium to punish harm done as a means but not harm\ndone as a by-product.\n\nSimilar arguments can be made for why we find direct physical transgressions\nworse than indirect ones, a moral distinction relevant to, for instance, the United\nStates’ current drone policy. Cushman et al. (2006) found that subjects condemn\npushing a man off a bridge (to stop a train heading toward five others) more harshly\nthan flipping a switch that leads the man to fall through a trap door. Pushing the\nvictim with a stick is viewed as intermediate in terms of moral wrongness. Such\nmoral wrongness judgments are consistent with considerations of higher-order\nbeliefs: When a man is physically pushed, any witness knows the pushing was\nintended, but when a man is pushed with a stick some might not realize this, and\neven those who realize it might suspect others will not. Even more so when a button\nis pressed that releases a trap door.\n\nIt is worth noting that the above argument does not depend on a specific model\nof punishment, as in DeScioli and Kurzban’s (2009) Side-Taking Game. The above\nmodel also makes the two novel predictions enumerated above, but nevertheless\ncaptures the same basic insight. It is also worth noting the contrast between the\nabove argument and that of Cushman et al. (2006) and Greene et al. (2009), whose\nmodels rest on ease of learning or ease of mentally simulating a situation. It is not\nobvious to us how those models would explain that the omission-commission and\nmeans—by-product distinctions seem to depend on priors or be unique to settings of\ncoordinated punishment.\n\nWhy Morality Depends on Categorical Distinctions\n\nWe explain why our moral intuitions depends so much more strongly on whether a\ntransgression occurred than on how much damage was caused. Our argument again\nuses coordinated punishment and higher-order beliefs: When a categorical distinc-\ntion is violated, you know others know it was violated, but this is not always true for\ncontinuous variables.\n\nConsider the longstanding norm against the use of chemical weapons. This norm\nrecently made headlines when Bashar al-Assad was alleged to have used chemical\nweapons to kill about a thousand Syrian civilians, outraging world leaders who had\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015514",
