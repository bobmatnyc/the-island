Illustrative of these decisions is the thoughtful analysis by the U.S. District Court for the District of\nNebraska in Bothwell v. Republic Tobacco Co. 3!? Bothwell presented four grounds for its holding that courts have inherent\npower to appoint attorneys to represent indigent litigants:\n\n1) courts possess the herent power to bring to their assistance those \"instruments\" necessary to ensure a \"fair and just\"\nadjudicative process in individual cases; 2) in many, if not most, cases, due to the adversarial nature of our system, lawyers are\na necessary component in ensuring such a \"fair and just\" process; 3) to a significant degree, neither the private marketplace nor\npublic or charitable efforts provide indigent litigants with adequate access to legal assistance; and 4) to that extent, such failure\nthreatens the reliability of the results of the adversarial process. 313\n\nThese grounds readily apply to appointing attorneys for indigent victims when important rights under the CVRA are at stake.\nWithout [*914] an attorney to press her claims, a victim may be unable to obtain a \"fair and just\" adjudicative process. *!4\nMoreover, crime victim representation appears to be a prime example of a situation where \"neither the private marketplace nor\npublic or charitable efforts provide indigent litigants with adequate access to legal assistance.\" 3!° No financial incentive will\ndrive lawyers to represent victims in criminal cases. *!© And while pro bono representation for victims is expanding, 7!” it still\nfalls far short of the needs of victims in the federal system. The fourth and final requirement - that the failure of attorneys to\nrepresent the indigent client threatens the reliability of the system - is also present where rights under the CVRA are at stake.\nNeither the prosecutor nor the defendant has a personal stake in the victim's rights, and, frequently, they will have other\npriorities and interests that may even be adverse to the rights of the victim. *!* Accordingly, courts have inherent authority to\nappoint counsel to represent indigent victims and, indeed, may even be able to require [*915] counsel to serve without\ncompensation. *!° The local rules of some federal courts already explicitly recognize this power. 37°\n\nIn addition to this inherent authority, federal courts appear to possess statutory authority to make such an appointment. Title 28\nbroadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to \"request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford\ncounsel.\" 3?! Moreover, at least one statute already directly authorizes federal courts to appoint counsel for child victims in\n\nZelin, Court Appointment of Attorney To Represent, Without Compensation, Indigent in Civil Action, 52 A.L.R. 4th 1063 (1987 & Supp.\n2004).\n\n312 912 F. Supp. 1221 (D. Neb. 1995).\n\nw\n\n3 Id. at 1229.\n\nw\n\n4 See generally John W. Gillis & Douglas Beloof, The Next Step for a Maturing Victim Rights Movement: Enforcing Crime Victim Rights\nin the Courts, 33 McGeorge L. Rev. 689, 692 (2002).\n\nw\n\n5 Bothwell, 912 F. Supp. at 1229.\n\nw\n\n© See Gillis & Beloof, supra note 314, at 698-700.\n\n317 See infra note 324 and accompanying text (discussing funding in the CVRA for the National Crime Victims Law Institute and other legal\nclinics for victims).\n\nw\n\n8 See Gillis & Beloof, supra note 314, at 692.\n\n319 See Mallard v. U.S. Dist. Court, 490 U.S. 296, 307 & n.8 (1989) (leaving open the question of whether federal courts possess the inherent\nauthority to require counsel to provide legal services to the poor). Several lower courts have concluded that appointment without\ncompensation is proper. See Bothwell, 912 F. Supp. at 1230-34 (counsel have a duty to serve without compensation); Family Division Trial\nLawyers of the Superior Court-D.C. v. Moultrie, 725 F.2d 695, 705 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (rejecting argument that pro bono appointment violates\nthe Thirteenth Amendment because attorneys can take steps to avoid the pro bono appointments and holding that pro bono court\nappointments are not per se \"takings,\" as accepting court ordered representation of indigents is a condition of receiving a law license, but\nexcessive burden could present takings problem); Williamson _v. Vardeman, 674 F.2d 1211, 1211 (8th Cir. 1982) (noting that pro bono\nservice is a voluntary obligation undertaken by attorneys when they apply for a license to practice law); 7vler v. Lark, 472 F.2d 1077, 1079-\n80 (8th Cir. 1973) (no takings problem with appointment); United States v. Dillon, 346 F.2d 633, 635-36 (9th Cir. 1965) (no taking problems\nwith appointment). But see State ex rel. Scott v. Roper, 688 S.W.2d 757, 759-70 (Mo. 1985) (questioning power of courts to appoint counsel\nwithout providing compensation).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017760",
