  "text": "ways by both Mueller and White House insiders: it puts the President's\npublic behavior on trial. The nature of that behavior, for the Mueller\nteam, is corrupt; this, according to the White House, is how voters\nelected the President to behave.\n\nThe Special Counsel seems less worried about its legal position\nthan it does about it’s existential one—continuing to anticipate how the\nPresident might use his authority to move against it.\n\nIt sees its most immediate threat as a move by the President to\nreplace Rosenstein. Here it believes that in the inevitable Supreme Court\nbattle that would follow a direct attempt by the President to fire the\nSpecial Counsel, the Court would likely rebuff such an expansion of\nPresidential authority. At the same time, according to its internal\nresearch, the Mueller team understands that the President, acting with\nonly somewhat more subtlety, would have the authority to order the\nAttorney General—even given his prior recusal—to repeal the Special\nCounsel regulations and close down the investigation. He can fire the\nAttorney General if he refuses. The President, could, too, according to\nthe Special Counsel's analysis, fire Rosenstein and seek someone else to\noversee the investigation in ways more to his liking.

The delays and disruption that\nresult as courts sort out the ramifications of the President's actions\nmight well be the President's legal friend—the reason some in the\nWhite House have been urging the President to end the investigation,\nwhatever the political fallout.\n\nIf so, what then happens to all the work the Special Counsel's\noffice has done, and, indeed, to the sitting Grand Juries reviewing the\nevidence? The special counsel's view, according to insiders working on\nthe issues, is that nobody knows. The optimistic legal view is that the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030262",
