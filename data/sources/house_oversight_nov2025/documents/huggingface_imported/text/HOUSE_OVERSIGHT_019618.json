Clapper’s answer was clearly untrue,\nbut it did not mislead Senator Wyden or any other members of the\nSenate Intelligence Committee; Clapper had truthfully testified in a\nclassified session of the committee earlier that week that the NSA\ndid collect Americans’ telephone records. It was the American people\nwho were being misled. Yet none of the senators on the committee\ncorrected this obviously false answer. When Clapper realized he had\nmisspoken, he could not publicly correct the record of the public ses-\nsion, because to do so would be revealing classified information he\nhad sworn to protect. No doubt other intelligence officers find them-\nselves in a similar bind in discussing secret matters. This suggests\nthat there is a risk in accepting statements made by the intelligence\nchiefs at face value.\n\nBut Snowden also has a credibility problem. He has told numerous\nuntruths, including some calculated to help him insinuate himself\ninto the key positions from which he stole secrets and some calcu-\nlated to cover up the nature of his theft. For example, Snowden got\n\n© access in the spring of 2013 to the NSA’s super-secret computers that ©\nstored these electronic files by working at Booz Allen Hamilton. On\nhis application to Booz Allen in March 2013, as we’ve seen, Snowden\nclaimed to be in the process of completing a master’s degree at the\nUniversity of Liverpool in computer security sciences. Snowden had\nnot completed a single course there and purposely lied to get access\nto classified documents and then to get safely away with them.\n\nHe was also not entirely truthful with the journalists whose\ntrust he sought when it suited his purpose of protecting himself.\nFor example, as we have seen, in contacting Laura Poitras under the\nalias Citizen Four in January 2013, he told her that he was currently\na “government employee,” although in fact he was working for a\nprivate contractor at the time.\n\nSnowden had little concern about misleading journalists when\nit suited his purpose. For example, he told Alan Rusbridger of The\nGuardian, Brian Williams of NBC News, James Bamford of Wired,\nKatrina vanden Heuvel of The Nation, Barton Gellman, and Jane\nMayer of The New Yorker that the U.S. government intentionally\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 130 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019618",
