  "text": "This book is only in part the story of my life — a life that, from my\nbeginnings as a kibbutz boy in pre-state Palestine, has been intimately entwined\nwith the infancy and adolescence and, now, the increasingly troubled middle\nage of the State of Israel.\n\nStill less is it only a record of its, or my, achievements, although they are\ninevitably a part of the story.\n\nIn setting out to write it, I was also determined to document, from the inside,\nthe critical setbacks as well. Mistakes. Misjudgements. Missed opportunities.\nAnd the lessons that we can, and must, be prepared to learn from them.\n\nNo less so than I when I was planning a hijack rescue or a cross-border\ncommando operation in Saveret Matkal, | remain convinced that Israel’s\nsecurity, Israel’s very identity, can be safeguarded only by evaluating\ndispassionately the situation in our country and the world. And by looking\nahead.\n\nEven when I was a soldier, I never stopped thinking this way, especially\nwhen, first as military intelligence chief and especially as Chief of Staff, I knew,\nin detail, every one of the security threats that faced Israel and was part of\ndiscussions and decisions to try to confront them. I still vividly remember as\nChief of Staff, every Friday before the arrival of the Jewish Sabbath, sitting\nwith Rabin, who was then Israel’s Defence Minister. Our offices were along the\nsame hallway of the Airya, the ministry’s headquarters in the heart of Tel Aviv.\nRabin had a very low table in his office, with two chairs. We would sit across\nfrom each other, each with a ready supply of coffee and Yitzhak smoking an\napparently endless supply of cigarettes, and we would just talk. Politics.\nStrategy. Israel. The PLO. The surrounding Arab states. And the wider world.\n\nMany years before I became Prime Minister, I gave a lecture at a memorial\nmeeting for an Israeli academic. Not many people were there. I doubt even they\nremember it. But I do, because what I said has, sadly, become more prophetic\nthan even I could have imagined. I talked about the imperative for peace as part\nof Israel’s security. There was a “window,” I said. We were militarily strong. In\nregional terms, we were a superpower. But politically, resolving the conflict\nwith our Arab enemies would almost certainly become more difficult with time.\n\n9\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011480",
