  "text": "Equities overview\n\nGlobal equity markets - Key points\n\ne We keep an overall neutral allocation to equities (see summary on slide 3).\n\n° We keep our preference for US equities. Resilient company earnings still soeak for an overweight\nstance. Continued economic growth should underpin earnings also in 2013.\n\n¢ We keep our neutral stance on Eurozone equities. Value is attractive compared to global equities.\nHowever, due to the recession in several countries the earnings dynamics remains weak. In addition,\nuncertainty as to when and under what conditions Spain will sign a memorandum of understanding keeps\nus from taking a more positive stance.\n\n¢ We have an overweight position in EM equities. Monetary easing as well as fiscal stimulus in key\ncountries, coupled with relatively attractive valuations, are supporting factors. Economic activity is likely to\nimprove gradually over the coming quarters, supporting company earnings.\n\n¢ We keep our negative stance on Canadian equities. Corporate earnings continue to decline, showing\na weak development relative to the global trend. In addition, valuation is not compelling.\n\n¢ We are cautious on Australian equities. Realized earnings continue to come down for the market.\n\n¢ We are neutral on Swiss equities. Companies show solid earnings growth, which is expected to hold up\nbetter than in other regions. Although the Swiss franc is still overvalued, the weakening to the USD and\nrelated currencies since this summer provides additional earnings support.\n\n¢ We keep our neutral view on UK equities. In the UK the earnings dynamics lags behind other markets.\nAlso, the recent strengthening in the pound is a drag for earnings measured in local currency terms.\n\nGlobal equity sectors - Key points\n\n¢ We keep our overweight in Consumer Staples. Among the defensives it offers good earnings growth\nprospects due to its geographically diversified revenue generation.\n\n¢ We reiterate our preference for global IT due to a superior growth outlook and as we are in the\nseasonally strong second half year. With healthy balance sheets and good cash flows, sector valuation is in\nline with the overall market, while we believe it deserves a larger premium.\n\n¢ We continue to like Healthcare as it offers solid long-term earnings prospects with low volatility and\nstrong balance sheets. We reiterate our underweight in Telecoms, where we expect ongoing weak\nrevenue growth as well as margin pressure.\n\n¢ We are negative on Consumer Discretionary as earnings expectations may be too optimistic. With\nleading indicators in major regions still deteriorating, we keep our underweight in Industrials. We have\nconcerns over weak manufacturing momentum leading to increased earnings revisions.\n\n¢ The earnings outlook for US and Asian Financials is solid. We are neutral globally on Financials. While\nthe ECB's OMT program reduces tail risk for Financials, it has limited impact on sector earnings.\n\n2 UBS\n\nPreferences (6 months)\n\nunderweight neutral overweight\n\nEquities T\n\ntotal\n\nCanada\n\nNorth\nAmerica\nCc\nwn\n>\n\nEMU\nQ UK\n2\n@ Switzerland\nSweden\nAustralia |\nHong Kong |\niS}\n4\no I\n< Japan\nSingapore |\n= Global—EM =\n\nBnew old\nNote: Preference in hedged terms (excl. currencies)\n\nunderweight neutral overweight\nConsumer Discretionary =\nConsumer Staples al\nEnergy |\nFinancials |\nHealthcare =\nIndustrials |\nIT =\nMaterials |\nTelecom SS\nUtilities |\nmnew old\n\nSource: UBS\n\nFor further information please contact ClO asset class specialists Markus Irngartinger, markus.irngartinger@ubs.com, or Carsten Schlufter carsten.schlufter@ubs.com 13\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025260",
