  "text": "Marina Market Analysis 30\n\nmarina sales have indicated that now is a good time to invest in a marina, despite the previous\nrecession and limited financing.\n\nCompetitive Marinas\n\nThe most significant supply and demand indicators for the subject are rental and occupancy rates\nexperienced by directly competing properties. The operation of a pleasure craft marina provides\nrevenue sources which include a mix of various rental, sales and services for the pleasure craft\noperators. Principle revenue stream for pleasure craft marinas includes in-water slips, fuel sales, and\nbuilding rent.\n\nThe subject’s asking and average contract rates are shown in the table that follows. The current\noperator is leasing the marina slips by linear feet of vessel length. We have then converted this rental\nincome into a rental rate per linear foot of dock space. The subject offers slip rental on a daily, weekly,\nmonthly, seasonal and annual basis. The contracted rental rates represent a blend of these rates, from\ndaily tenants to long term tenants on annual leases. According to management, approximately 60% of\nthe occupants at any given time are seasonal or annual tenants.\n\nMarina Rent Roll\n\nTotal Annual Average\n\n#of Average LF Annual LF Total LF Occupancy Total Rental Monthly Rental\n\nYear Slips er Sli Available Occupied Rate Revenue Rate/LF\n2010 105 53.29 2,042,170 1,379,235 67.5% $1,551,721 $34.22\n2011 105 53.18 2,038,110 1,298,157 63.7% $1,490,744 $34.93\n2012 105 54.24 2,078,880 1,155,377 55.6% $1,290,526 $33.97\n2013 105 54.10 2,073,200 1,206,388 58.2% $1,362,951 $34.36\n2014 105 54.10 2,073,200 1,233,672 59.5% $1,513,100 $37.31\n2015 (Annualized 105 54.10 2,073,200 1,172,976 56.6% $1,438,110 $37.29\nAverage 105 54 2,063,127 1,240,968 60.1% $1,441,192 $35.35\n\nWe weren't provided with a current rent roll for the marina slips but we were provided with monthly\nhistorical occupancy and rental rate data. With the transient nature of marina tenants, a historical\nrent and occupancy figures are a more accurate indication of the income properties of the marina.\nRental rates at the subject, and in this market, are based ona rate per linear foot of vessel length. As\ndiscussed earlier, the subject contains 105 wet slips with a total of 5,680 linear feet of rentable dock\nspace, which indicates a total of 2,073,200 rentable linear feet per year.\n\nAs of the effective valuation date, the subject marina has experienced an overall occupancy rate of\n56.3% for the year to date 2015. We have looked at occupancy rates on an average, annual basis due\nto the seasonal characteristics of this property type in this market. Again, due to the transient nature\nof the tenants in this property type and the short term nature of the leases which can range from daily\nto annually, the overall occupancy rate will be lower than other commercial property types such as\nlodging, multifamily, retail and office. The subject’s current occupancy rate is slightly lower than\nhistorical rates, but the property is considered to be at stabilized occupancy.\n\nThe weighted average contract rate is $37.29 per linear foot per month for the year to date 2015,\nwhich equates to an average contract rate of $447.50 per linear foot per year.\n\nIGY American Yacht Harbor Marina\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018840",
