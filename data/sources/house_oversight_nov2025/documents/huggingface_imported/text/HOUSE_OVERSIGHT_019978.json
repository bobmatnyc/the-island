  "text": "president of the United States, Donald J. Trump ...”—a salutation directed more to the\npresident than to the audience.\n\nPence cast himself as blandly uninteresting, sometimes barely seeming to exist in the\nshadow of Donald Trump. Little leaked out of the Pence side of the White House. The\npeople who worked for the vice president, were, like Pence himself, people of few words.\n\nIn a sense, he had solved the riddle of how to serve as the junior partner to a president\nwho could not tolerate any kind of comparisons: extreme self-effacement.\n\n“Pence,” said Walsh, “is not dumb.”\n\nActually, well short of intelligent was exactly how others in the West Wing saw him.\nAnd because he wasn’t smart, he was not able to provide any leadership ballast.\n\nOn the Jarvanka side, Pence became a point of grateful amusement. He was almost\nabsurdly happy to be Donald Trump’s vice president, happy to play the role of exactly the\nkind of vice president that would not ruffle Trump’s feathers. The Jarvanka side credited\nPence’s wife, Karen, as the guiding hand behind his convenient meekness. Indeed, he took\nto this role so well that, later, his extreme submissiveness struck some as suspicious.\n\nThe Priebus side, where Walsh firmly sat, saw Pence as one of the few senior West\nWing figures who treated Priebus as though he was truly the chief of staff. Pence often\nseemed like a mere staffer, the ever present note taker in so many meetings.\n\nFrom the Bannon side, Pence garnered only contempt. “Pence is like the husband in\nOzzie and Harriet, a nonevent,” said one Bannonite.\n\nAlthough many saw him as a vice president who might well assume the presidency\nsomeday, he was also perceived as the weakest vice president in decades and, in\norganizational terms, an empty suit who was useless in the daily effort to help restrain the\npresident and stabilize the West Wing.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nDuring that first month, Walsh’s disbelief and even fear about what was happening in the\nWhite House moved her to think about quitting. Every day after that became its own\ncountdown toward the moment she knew she wouldn’t be able to take it anymore—which\nwould finally come at the end of March. To Walsh, the proud political pro, the chaos, the\nrivalries, and the president’s own lack of focus and lack of concern were simply\nincomprehensible.\n\nIn early March, Walsh confronted Kushner and demanded: “Just give me the three\nthings the president wants to focus on. What are the three priorities of this White House?”\n\n“Yes,” said Kushner, wholly absent an answer, “we should probably have that\nconversation.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019978",
