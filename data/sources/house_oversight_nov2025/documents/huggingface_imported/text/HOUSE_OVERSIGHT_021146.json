  "text": "sympathy and gave him my pity, believing this man had a heart. His next\nproposal was eerie, he said,” If you wanted, I can be your new Daddy.\nSomeone to take care of you and you’ll be my new baby forever” he\nstroked my hair such as a caring parent would comfort a scared child. A\npart of me wanted to accept his words and believe he really could feel\nthat way, and then I also considered how hard it was living on the streets.\nIn the end I convinced myself this would be the lesser of two evils.\n\nThe car stopped at a plaza on the water, surrounded by little boutique\nshops, restaurants, and little stalls with items for sale like sunglasses and\ncostume jewelry. I didn’t know what to say or do or how to act, it all\nhappened so fast I just went along with everything he said, for now.\n\nWe went to a take out restaurant and ate on the waterside, and\nafterwards he took me to G.A.P Kids co. to dress me in his idea of proper\nattire, tiny cutoff shorts revealing the cusp of my buttocks and some shirts\nthat barely fit, even the sales assistant was shocked at what she thought\nwas my Grandfathers choice in clothing. | couldn’t even believe it myself\nonly an hour ago | was begging for money living on the streets and now I\nwas dining alfresco and shopping at name brand outlets. We then hit a\ncouple of more specialty stores afterwards. He said he had to buy me a\nfew more necessities to start with. Lacy G-strings and what looked to me\nlike lingerie pieces I had only seen grown women wearing in magazine\nad’s or movies was now a part of my wardrobe, in my mind it was a big\nstep up from being a little girl any longer.\n\nThe driver took us back to Ron’s grand apartment overlooking the isle\nof Key Biscayne and a large bridge leading into a Miami Harbor.\nEntering his residence, { was blown away by the spectacular view, rich\ndécor, and white marble floors that were so glossy it looked as if 1 was\nstepping on glass. He took my shopping bags to a large room at the back\nof the apartment and put them into a small closet. The room was\nconsiderably large with glass exterior walls that maximized the potential\nof the panorama landscape soaking in the seascape of Miami. In the room\nwas a gigantic round bed raised off the floor by three steps and mirrors on\nthe ceiling. It looked like a honeymoon suite out of a raunchy hotel. He\nthen exclaimed, “This is my room here and you will be sharing it with\nme” When I asked him where I would sleep he then sickly replied “With\nme silly, where else of course?” With no room for argument I pretended\nto be O.K with everything that my common sense was screaming out in\nmy head to run.\n\nNext | was taken down a long hall at the other end of the apartment to\nmeet five more exotic beauties. Three girls were in their late teens and the\nother two in were in their early twenties. All of them were from the\nCzech, here under false passports provided by Ron and his contacts. Yana\nheld my hand while introducing me to the group of girls as “Baby” a pet\n\n[) Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004136\n\nname she came up with for me, being | was the youngest one among them\nor ever to be brought in by Ron for that matter. It became my new\nidentity not even worrying to mention my real name to anyone anymore.\nMy identity was no longer important to myself, I wanted to become\nsomeone new and “Baby” is who I was.\n\nA shocking first impression, the girls were completely nude revealing\ntheir voluptuous young bodies with such a careless ease and others were\nin just a G-string, similar to the one’s Ron had bought me earlier. They\nwere all stunning girls and full of life. Charismatic and beautiful, they\nwere the girls who should be on the front of billboards not selling their\nbodies to old crewed men for sex. Doing each other’s make-up in front of\nthe mirror and chatting away on the bed with no care in the world, aiming\nat persuading me to see the highlights of the life Ron gave them and they\nalmost did. Ron left the room for a few moments, letting us all get to\nknow each other a little better and that’s when I started to compile an\nunderstanding of what really went on here.\n\nJust catching a bit of their conversation from before my introduction, |\nheard them chatting about the night they were preparing for. Speaking\nexcitedly about some men they would be entertaining in a few hours, one\ngirl was talking about going out to sea with one o these clients on a yacht\nfor a few days. Since none of the girls seemed shy to talk about their\nprofessions or anything for that matter, 1 decided to ask them a few\nquestions about what they did. They were more than happy to expand on\ntheir point of view in the conversation, attempting to paint a pretty picture\nof what they were paid to do.\n\nThey all began to jump up and down with excitement like giddy school\ngirls at a slumber party. Another girl with jet-black hair and a thick\naccent, wearing absolutely nothing at all, grabbed me onto the bed with\nthem and into their fiasco, instantly making me feel accepted into their\nsorority, like I actually belonged somewhere for once. Yana went on to\nexplain a little more in detail, “ We accompany the wealthy friends of\nRon. They want only beautiful girls by their side so we come and act\nhowever they want us too but most importantly we make them think we\nwant them back too.” Other girls began to jump in with their vivid points\nof view while playing with my hair, they were taking turns brushing and\nstyling it as they were filling my head with all of the prospects I could\nhave as an escort too. They made me feel beautiful like them, too\nbeautiful for what a girl beyond my years should feel. I was simply being\nlured into a dangerous trap, just like they had been at a young age too.\n\nIt pretty much all came down to two things in their game, the money\nthey would make and the lifestyle they were given. Their enthusiasm only\ninterested me further, making it not only sound like an acceptable way of\nliving but also appearing to keep them all vivaciously satisfied. This way\n\n\\) Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIULTREO04 137\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021146",
