  "text": "11\n\nWhy? I don't see any contradiction between an effort to revive peace\ntalks and our going to the U.N. Also, [for all practical purposes] we\nare already at the U.N. It's there.... And all those who support the\n1967 lines [the border before Israel seized the West Bank during that\nyear's Middle East War] with mutually agreed swap [of land] should\nsupport our endeavor.\n\nThe Obama administration doesn't support your bid, though it\nsupports using the 1967 lines with swaps as the baseline for the\nborder of a Palestinian state.\n\nWe urge the U.S. to see it the way it is. We are trying to preserve the\ntwo-state solution in the face of an Israeli government that is\ndetermined to destroy it. Going to the U.N. is an attempt to preserve\nthe two-state solution so Palestinians and Israelis can live side by side\nin peace and security.\n\nWhat's your plan if the U.S. vetoes full membership? Have\nAmericans told you they will veto?\n\nThe U.S. told us that the U.N. is not an option they will support. I\nhope they will not veto. How will they explain a veto?\n\nThey say that direct negotiation with Israel is the only way to\nreach a deal.\n\nWhat have we been doing for the past 20 years? What have we been\ndoing since [President George H.W.]| Bush told us that if we\nrecognize Israel, accept the two-state solution and renounce violence,\nthe U.S. will stand shoulder to shoulder with us?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025007",
