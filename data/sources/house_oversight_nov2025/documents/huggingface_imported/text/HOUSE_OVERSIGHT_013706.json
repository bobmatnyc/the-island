  "text": "nearness and sequential order not absolute distances), symbolic dynamical\nprocesses which as either (1) or (2) can be analyzed with respect to its various\nentropies, algorithmic complexities and word content and syntax. A variety of\ntechniques aimed at deciding between the relevance of one or another of these\nunderlying assumptions (such as series and Fourier phase shuffling to destroy\nstatistical autocorrelations and vectorial continuities but leaving the probability\ndensity distributions intact ) may at times help emphasize one or another of these\norientations in the analyses (see Ott et al, 1994 for a collection of articles on this\n\ntopic).\n\nNonconvergent Distributions and Power Law Scaling in Biologically Relevant\n\nTime Series\n\nThe statistical distribution with which most of us are familiar is the Gaussian\nwhich can be generated by summing and averaging a series of independent\nrandom events. The average behavior head/tails probabilities observed by one\nperson flipping a fair coin for a very long time or by many people flipping similar\ncoins for shorter times converges upon the invariant measure of 0.5. The variance,\n“second moment” in the distribution of a population of coin flipping sequences will\nbe finite and computable. In a graph of this distribution, the tails will converge to the\nxX axis in a Gaussian exponential manner. The longer or the more numerous the\n“sample” series of observations, the closer they will approximate the “ergodic”\ninvariant measures representing the true “central moments” of the behavior of this\n“population” of fair flipping coins. Since the coins are not changing their relevant\ncharacteristics over the time of observation, we say that the series is not time\ndependent but instead is “stationary.” Computation of correlations over increasing\nlags to determine how much and for how many flips the sequences continue to\nresemble themselves yield an exponential decay with a single characteristic\ncorrelation length. This reflects the existence of a finite variance from which its\namplitude is derived and serves as the single characteristic temporal scale of the\n\nrandom process.\n\n206\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013706",
