He said If the sides can’t agree on a resolution, then Marra would likely\nhave to come up with one. The case is being closely watched by crime victims’ rights advocates, as it will likely set\n\na precedent.\n\nAcosta, who was appointed by Trump as the U.S. secretary of labor in 2017, is the focus of a separate Justice\nDepartment investigation into whether there was any prosecutorial misconduct in the Epstein case. That probe, by\nthe DOJ’s Office of Professional Responsibility, was initiated in response to demands from a bipartisan group in\nCongress, led by Republican Sen. Ben Sasse of Nebraska and Democratic Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of\nFlorida.\n\nIn the meantime, a court hearing will be held at 4 p.m. Wednesday in New York in another Epstein-related case. A\nfederal appeals court will hear oral arguments in a motion by the Miami Herald, supported by 32 other news\norganizations, asking the court to unseal documents that could reveal details about the extent of Epstein’s crimes and\n\nany other people who may have been involved.\n\nThree of Epstein’s former attorneys — who helped negotiate his plea deal in 2008 — wrote a letter published in the\nNew York Times on Monday, defending the plea bargain cut with Acosta as a fair deal. The letter was in response to\na Times editorial that called on Congress and the Trump administration to hold Acosta and others involved in the\n\ncase accountable.\n\nEpstein’s lawyers said the editorial’s conclusions were “in profound conflict with the reality,’’ noting that there was\nno evidence that Epstein committed federal sex trafficking offenses. The letter was signed by former Epstein lawyers\n\nKenneth Starr, Jack Goldberger and Lilly Ann Sanchez, as well as Epstein’s current attorney, Martin G. Weinberg.\n\nRead more here: https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article227136459.html#storylink=cpy\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031401",
