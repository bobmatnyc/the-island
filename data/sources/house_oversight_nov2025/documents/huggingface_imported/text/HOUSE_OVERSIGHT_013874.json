  "text": "At a Glance: Where You Will Be\n\nThe future is here. It’s just not widely distributed yet.\n— WILLIAM GIBSON, author of Neuromancer; coined term “cyberspace” in 1984\n\nH.. is a sneak preview of full automation.\n\nI woke up this morning, and given that it’s Monday, I checked my e-mail for one hour after an\nexquisite Buenos Aires breakfast.\n\nSowmya from India had found a long-lost high school classmate of mine, and Anakool from YMII\nhad put together Excel research reports for retiree happiness and the average annual hours worked in\ndifferent fields. Interviews for this week had been set by a third Indian virtual assistant, who had also\nfound contact information for the best Kendo schools in Japan and the top salsa teachers in Cuba. In the\nnext e-mail folder, I was pleased to see that my fulfillment account manager in Tennessee, Beth, had\nresolved nearly two dozen problems in the last week—keeping our largest clients in China and South\nAfrica smiling—and had also coordinated California sales tax filing with my accountants in Michigan.\nThe taxes had been paid via my credit card on file, and a quick glance at my bank accounts confirmed\nthat Shane and the rest of the team at my credit card processor were depositing more cash than last\nmonth. All was right in the world of automation.\n\nIt was a beautiful sunny day, and I closed my laptop with a smile. For an all-you-can-eat buffet\nbreakfast with coffee and orange juice, I paid $4 U.S. The Indian outsourcers cost between $4-10 US.\nper hour. My domestic outsourcers are paid on performance or when product ships. This creates a curious\nbusiness phenomenon: Negative cash flow is impossible.\n\nFun things happen when you earn dollars, live on pesos, and compensate in rupees, but that’s just the\nbeginning.\n\nBut Pm an Employee! How Does This Help Me?\n\nNobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you’re a\nman, you take it.\n\n—MALCOLM X, Malcolm X Speaks\n\nGQyrrins a remote personal assistant is a huge departure point and marks the moment that you learn\n\nhow to give orders and be commander instead of the commanded. It is small-scale training wheels for the\nmost critical of NR skills: remote management and communication.\n\nIt is time to learn how to be the boss. It isn’t time-consuming. It’s low-cost and it’s low-risk. Whether\nor not you “need” someone at this point is immaterial. It is an exercise.\n\nIt is also a litmus test for entrepreneurship: Can you manage (direct and chastise) other people? Given\nthe proper instruction and practice, I believe so. Most entrepreneurs fail because they jump into the deep\nend of the pool without learning to swim first. Using a virtual assistant (VA) as a simple exercise with no\ndownside, the basics of management are covered in a 24-week test costing between $100—400. This is\nan investment, not an expense, and the ROI is astounding. It will be repaid in a maximum of 10-14 days,\nafter which it is pure timesaving profit.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013874",
