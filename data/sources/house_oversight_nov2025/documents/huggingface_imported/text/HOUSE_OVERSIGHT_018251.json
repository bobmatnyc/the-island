  "text": "power operates as much through light pulses running through fiber optic webs as it\ndoes in any physical sense. Think of the most influential geopolitical forces. The\nmost lethal militaries. The greatest new commercial or financial efforts. All now\ndepend on and are nearly defined by their fluency with different sorts of connection.\n\nNetworks emerge when nodes - which can be composed of people, financial\nmarkets, computers, mobile devices, drones or any lively and connectable object -\nlink to other nodes. Networks can be defined by geography, or by language or\ncurrency or data protocols or any of a thousand particular features.!! People who\nlive in Bangalore, is a network. As is, Switches running DNSSEC protocol on the\nInternet or Businesses transacting in Rupiah. An engineer might say: Network power\nis simply the ceaseless summing, at any instant, of all these bundles of connection.\nReal, physical networks hum magnetically now in cities that now pulse and grow\nwith accelerating, connected speed. New York City is network, in this sense, as is\nBeijing or - in a less evolved way - the Alaskan steppe. So while it’s tempting to call\nthe 21st Century the “Urban Century”, in fact the billion-people a decade rush into\ncities is a symptom. A larger hunger for the constant knitting of lives together, for\nfresh and efficient connection drives us.!4 Of course completely, powerfully virtual\ninstances of networks exist too: knit webs of computers teaching themselves how to\nread, or the fast, paranoid and careful buzzing of constantly alert cybersecurity\nfirewalls. All of these systems are defined by relations. Their power comes from the\nnumber, the type and the speed of the connections they hungrily establish and then\nuse. Networks don’t merely speed up our markets, our news, or our innovation -\nthey revolutionize the nature of their power. Broad-based interconnection can cause\nand even determine events.\n\nThese expanding, ever-thicker webs of data and linkage can be mapped, and taken\ntogether they reflect something we are coming to know as “Network Power’”.!3 By\nthis phrase we mean not merely the Internet or twitter or crypto currencies like\n\n11 Networks can be defined: For an excellent overview of networks the following\ntexts are of use: Albert Barabasi, Linked The New Science Of Networks Science Of\nNetworks.
