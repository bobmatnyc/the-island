  "text": "\"Calculus is one of the greatest ideas that anyone has ever had and certainly the greatest idea in all of\nmathematics. The scientific and technological importance of calculus is one reason why we require all budding\nscientists and engineers to learn the subject. Taming Infinity is the human side of calculus: the gripping story of\nhow it was discovered, and lost, and then rediscovered a thousand years later, or how it perplexed many of the\ngeniuses who struggled to invent it, and in a few tragic cases, drove them insane. In a very real sense, this\nhumanistic side of calculus is just as fascinating and important as its scientific side as it, too, has changed the\nworld.\n\n\"Central to the story is the mathematicians' quest to tame infinity, which begins with the philosopher Zeno of\nElea (about 450 BC, before Socrates) who raised paradoxes about infinity, continuity, time, space, and motion\nthat confounded his contemporaries and provoked no less than Aristotle to banish infinity from Greek\nphilosophy and mathematics from then on. Fast-forward more than 2,500 years, and we’re still wrestling with\ninfinity and the paradoxes it raises. In between, the inventors of calculus, starting with Archimedes around 250\nBC and culminating with Newton and Leibniz in the mid-1600s, tried to domesticate infinity to make what we\nnow regard as integral and differential calculus. And to a large extent, they succeeded. The carefully controlled\nuse of infinity is the secret to calculus, the source of its enormous predictive power.\n\n\"But like Frankenstein’s monster or the golem in Jewish folklore, infinity was never quite under control. As in\nany tale of hubris, the monster inevitably turned on its creator. Soon after the work of Newton and Leibniz,\ndisturbing paradoxes emerged in the 1700s and early 1800s. Calculations came out wrong. Calculus seemed\nunreliable. These difficulties provoked another wave of philosophical and logical handwringing, much as Zeno’s\nhad two millennia earlier. These conundrums were resolved over the next century by the mathematicians who\ncalled themselves 'analysts.' The name was apt. They put calculus on the couch, and probed it, trying to root out\nevery last trace of pathology. They succeeded for calculus, but not for infinity itself. There the pathology ran\ndeeper. The riddles of infinity are still challenging logicians, mathematicians, and philosophers today.\"\n\nSTEVEN STROGATZ is the Jacob Gould Schurman Professor of Applied Mathematics at Cornell University.\nHe is the bestselling author of The Joy Of X, The Calculus Of Friendship, and Sync. His research has been\nfeatured in Nature, Science, Scientific American, the New York Times, the New Yorker, and broadcast on BBC\nRadio, National Public Radio, CBS News, among others. In 2010, he wrote a 15-part series about the elements\nof math for the New York Times, and a second series, Me, Myself and Math, appeared in 2012.

Norton; Proposal; 70,000 words; Delivery: February 2018]\n\nAdam Waytz is a rising star in the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University, whose research\nuses methods from social psychology and cognitive neuroscience to study how people think about minds. Waytz\nis the first person to receive twice the Theoretical Innovation Prize from the Society for Personality and Social\nPsychology. He is also the winner of the SAGE Young Scholar Award and the International Social Cognition\nNetwork's Early Career Award.\n\nWaytz writes: \"Everyday life is increasingly human-free. Robotic technology has begun replacing human jobs\nand will replace millions more over the next five years. In domains such as manufacturing and agriculture,\nrobotic employees are already a reality. Tasks like getting directions from another human or consulting with a\nbank teller to deposit money have become obsolete. These advances contribute to well-documented declines in\nsocial interaction. Not only has interaction with human beings diminished, but existing human interaction has\n\nBrockman, Inc. Frankfurt 2016 Hotlist\n-13-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025159",
