  "text": "Iraq\nTJP summary: Obama has been unable to find a way to keep a US voice in Iraq.\n\nIraq is a big deal and US has just disappeared. Admin says that NAM (Iraq PM)\nhas kept us out; Bush people say that Obama has walked away.\n\nMaghan O’: We should have kept resid force in Iraq. Most important function\nwould have been keeping a healthy tension between the central govt and new\ninstitutions. For 10 years Iraq has had a centralized power base. With removal of\nUS, you took away support for new institutions. Iraqis view removal of forces as a\nsign we don’t care.\n\nJim Steinberg: Could get that done. President was committed to keeping some\ntroops in Iraq and used his leverage to try and get that done. President supported\nNAM in hopes of getting a new SOFA. Tried everything. We could not deploy\nforces without deal on immunity. We need to now focus on how can we now\nengage. This is going to be hard to do without support (financial, security etc.)\n\nMO: President ignored lessons of 2008 SOFA negotiations. There, we got creative\non immunity.\n\nJS: NAM said he could do SOFA but couldn’t take it to Parliament. We insisted on\ngoing to Parliament beacause attys said without that we wouldn’t have a binding\ndeal.\n\nMO: Will Iraq hold together? More challenges now that I have seen since 2003,\nbut still more likely than not. NAM is consolidating power in last 9 mos which\nsends a msg to Kurds that they don’t like. If NAM kills democracy, then Kurds\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025798",
