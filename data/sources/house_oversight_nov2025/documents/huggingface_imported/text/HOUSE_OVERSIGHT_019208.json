  "text": "For example, in October 2014, he told the editor of the Nation, “I’m in exile. My\ngovernment revoked my passport intentionally to leave me exiled” and “chose to keep me\nin Russia.” According to Mr. Snowden, the U.S. government accomplished this\nentrapment by suspending his passport while he was in midair after he departed Hong\nKong on June 23, thus forcing him into the hands of President Vladimir Putin’s regime.\nNone of this is true. The State Department invalidated Mr. Snowden’s passport while he\nwas still in Hong Kong, not after he left for Moscow on June 23. The “Consul General-\nHong Kong confirmed that Hong Kong authorities were notified that Mr. Snowden’s\npassport was revoked June 22,” according to the State Department’s senior watch officer,\nas reported by ABC news on June 23, 2013.\n\nMr. Snowden could not have been unaware of the government’s pursuit of him, since the\ncriminal complaint against him, which was filed June 14, had been headline news in\nHong Kong. That the U.S. acted against him while he was still in Hong Kong is of great\nimportance to the timeline because it points to the direct involvement of Aeroflot, an\nairline which the Russian government effectively controls. Aeroflot bypassed its normal\nprocedures to allow Mr. Snowden to board the Moscow flight—even though he had\nneither a valid passport nor a Russian visa, as his newly assigned lawyer, Anatoly\nKucherena,said at a press conference in Russia on July 12, 2013.\n\nBy falsely claiming his passport was invalidated after the plane departed Hong Kong—\ninstead of before he left—Mr. Snowden hoped to conceal this extraordinary waiver. The\nRussian government further revealed its helping hand, judging by a report in Russia’s\nIzvestia newspaper when, on arrival, Mr. Snowden was taken off the plane by a security\nteam in a “special operation.”\n\nNor was it any kind of accident. Vladimir Putin personally authorized this assistance after\nMr. Snowden met with Russian officials in Hong Kong, as Mr. Putin admitted in a\ntelevised press conference on Sept. 2, 2013.\n\nTo provide a smokescreen for Mr. Snowden’s escape from Hong Kong, WikiLeaks (an\norganization that the Obama administration asserted to be a tool of Russian intelligence\nafter the hacking of Democratic Party leaders’ email in 2016) booked a dozen or more\ndiversionary flight reservations to other destinations for Mr. Snowden.\n\nWikiLeaks co-founder Julian Assange also dispatched Sarah Harrison, his deputy at\nWikiLeaks, to fly to Hong Kong to pay Mr. Snowden’s expenses and escort him to\nMoscow. In short, Mr. Snowden’s arrival in Moscow was neither accidental nor the work\nof the U.S. government.\n\nMr. Snowden’s own narrative asserts that he came to Russia not only empty-handed but\nwithout access to any of the stolen material. He wrote in Vanity Fair in 2014 that he had\ndestroyed all of it before arriving in Moscow—the very data that he went to such lengths\nto steal a few weeks earlier in Hawaii.\n\nAs it turns out, this claim is also untrue. It is belied by two Kremlin insiders who were in\na position to know what Mr. Snowden actually brought with him to Moscow. One of\nthem, Frants Klintsevich, was the first deputy chairman of the defense and security\ncommittee of the Duma (Russia’s parliament) at the time of Mr. Snowden’s defection.\n“Let’s be frank,” Mr. Klintsevich said in a taped interview with NPR in June 2016, “Mr.\nSnowden did share intelligence. This is what security services do.”\n\nThe other insider was Anatoly Kucherena, a well-connected Moscow lawyer and Mr.\nPutin’s friend. Mr. Kucherena served as the intermediary between Mr. Snowden and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019208",
