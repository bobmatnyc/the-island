  "text": "of neuroimaging—which, like a live sat-\nellite feed from inside the human body,\npermits scientists to track precisely how\na person reacts to a drug (or a placebo) as\nsoon as he takes it. An injection of saline,\nfor example, that has been described as a\ndrug not only will reduce symptoms of\nParkinson’s disease but can help a pa-\ntient produce more of the dopamine that\nthe disease destroys. Results like those\nhave provided scientists with chemical\nevidence of something they had long\nsuspected: simply believing in a treat-\nment can be as effective as the treatment\nitself. In several recent studies, placebos\nhave performed as well as drugs that\nAmericans spend millions of dollars on\neach year.\n\nTransforming interesting laboratory\nfindings into medicine is never simple,\nhowever, particularly when those find-\nings involve fake pills and sham in-\njections. Some people clearly respond\nbetter to placebos than others, though\nwe don't know why; some illnesses and\nafflictions are more amenable to sugges-\ntion than others; and many of the most\nintriguing findings are tenuous. Even so,\nthe recent research is difficult to dismiss.\nThrough conditioning techniques, for\nexample, our brain can “learn” different\nkinds of placebo effects: people first given\nmorphine and then a placebo have one\nneurochemical response, while people\nwho take ibuprofen followed by a pla-\ncebo have another. Different “doses”\ncause different reactions, and studies\nhave demonstrated that people who\nsuffer from headaches and consume as-\npirin regularly can associate the shape,\nthe color, and even the taste of a pill with\na decrease in pain. The value of treat-\nments like those—which have none of\nthe side effects of drugs—would be im-\nmense, but placebos are not pharmaceu-\nticals, and no reputable researcher has\nsuggested that they will soon be for sale\nat your local pharmacy.\n\nKaptchuk acknowledges that place-\nbos are not magic potions. “Placebos\ndon’t shrink tumors,” he said. “They\ndon’t make blind people see. If you are\nparalyzed, they won't help you walk.” He\ndeplores the grandiose claims of alterna-\ntive medicine and prefers to rely on data.\n“Ultimately, I am not a zealot or even a\ntrue believer,” he said. “I am sure that I do\nnot understand the placebo effect. I ask\nquestions, hopefully valuable questions,\n\nand we will see where the research lands.”\n\nKaptchuk practiced acupuncture for\nhalfhis adult life. But he stopped twenty\nyears ago. Despite the popularity of acu-\npuncture, clinical studies continually fail\nto demonstrate its effectiveness—a fact\nthat Kaptchuk doesn’t dispute. I asked\nhim how a person who talks about the\nprimacy of data and disdains what he\ncalls the “squishiness” of alternative med-\nicine could rely so heavily on a therapy\nwith no proven value. Kaptchuk smiled\nbroadly. “Because I am a damn good\nhealer,” he said. “That is the difficult\ntruth. If you needed help and you came\nto me, you would get better. Thousands\nof people have. Because, in the end, it\nisn't really about the needles. It’s about\nthe man.”\n\nor most of human history, placebos\n\nwere a fundamental tool in any phy-\nsician’s armamentarium—sometimes the\nonly tool. When there was nothing else\nto offer, placebos were a salve. The word\nitself comes from the Latin for “I will\nplease.” In medieval times, hired mourn-\ners participating in Vespers for the Dead\noften chanted the ninth line of Psalm\n116: “I shall please the dead in the land\nof the living.” Because the mourners were\nhired, their emotions were considered in-\nsincere. People called them “placebos.”\nThe word has always carried mixed\nconnotations. Thomas Jefferson wrote\napprovingly of what he called a “pious\nfraud,” and noted that “one of the most\nsuccessful physicians I have ever known\nhas assured me that he used more bread\npills, drops of coloured water, and pow-\nders of hickory ashes, than of all other\nmedicines put together.” But, as increas-\ningly specific knowledge about human\nanatomy emerged, people began to de-\nmand scientific answers to medical ques-\ntions. Knowledge displaced faith, and\nhuman health improved rapidly. Antibi-\notics are real; placebos are not.\n\nThe first publicly acknowledged pla-\ncebo-controlled trial—and still among\nthe most remarkable—took place at the\nrequest of King Louis XVI, in 1784,\nunder the direction of Benjamin Frank-\nlin, then the American Ambassador to\nFrance. The German physician Franz\nAnton Mesmer had become famous in\nVienna for a new treatment he called\n“animal magnetism,” and he claimed to\nhave discovered a healing fluid that\n\nTHE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 201 3l\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029926",
