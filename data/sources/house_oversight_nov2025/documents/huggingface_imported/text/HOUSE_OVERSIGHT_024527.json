KLC OpCo projects that tuition rates at existing centers will grow at\napproximately 4% per year for the next five years. This growth is below recent experience\n(6.9% in 2005). Moreover, tuition rates in the industry have been growing at average rates of\ngreater than 4%.\n\n= Utilization improvement. Management projects that recent improvements witnessed at KLC\nOpCo will continue. By 2011, KLC OpCo projects Utilization will have increased to 65.2%.\nManagement believes these improvements in Utilization will be the result of expected\nfavorable demographic trends (described elsewhere in this Memorandum), new sales training\nprograms, re-branding efforts in selected markets combined with the opening of appropriately\nsized centers.\n\n» New centers. KLC OpCo expects a net reduction of centers in 2006 and 2007 as it\ncompletes its integration of KinderCare and the rationalization of its properties. Beginning in\n2008, KLC OpCo projects to be adding net centers.\n\nKLC OpCo\n2005PF 2006P 2007P 2008P 2009P 2010P 2011P\nUtilization 61.2% 62.2% 63.0% 63.5% 63.9% 645% 65.2%\nAverage Weekly Tuition $167.35 $173.68 $179.99 $188.37 $197.47 $206.95 $216.52\n% Growth - 3.7% 3.6% 4.7% 4.8% 4.8% 4.6%\nCenter Count\nBeginning of Period 2,021 1,934 1,894 1,878 1,890 1,925 1,963\nNew Center Additions 10 10 24 52 75 78 80\nClosures (97) (50) (40) (40) (40) (40) (40)\nEnd of Period 1,934 1,894 1,878 1,890 1,925 1,963 2,003\n\nAdditional Products and Services\n\nKLC OpCo plans to use its footprint of approximately 2,000 centers across the U.S. as a platform to sell\nadditional educational (e.g., supplemental phonics, math, Spanish and music courses) and non-\neducational (e.g., health insurance, childcare financing) products and services.
