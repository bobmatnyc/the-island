  "text": "your personal bottom line has increased dramatically, if you had thought of me as your partner in this\nendeavor , instead of an employee, i think your reaction to sharing t benefits would be different.\n\nIf you recall, you wanted me to be paid , unlike others at the END of my work. we discussed this ad\nnauseum, and agreed OCT 15, last year was the end. You had wanted more comfort initially on the art\npartnership so that date was delayed. It has now been six monhts since then, your concept of aftercare. . for\nfree. was already unique , in your words this has to have an end.( weaned ) if the actions of josh and\n\nmark led to one hundred million dollars , what would be their share. Im not sure why it is different in your\nmind. but i respect the fact that it is, Is it because their work seems harder. it cannot be simply because they\ndevote more time to you .or it appears to involve more effort. Iam happy to continue to play a partnership\nrole. as I have been in many areas of your life.. I am also happy to move on and have no more of these\nemails. I find them as tedious as you do . if you prefer a partnership structure , ok with me, I tried to minimize\nthe amount of money i would recieve by making it a flat fee . as i wanted you to feel good and have no second\nthoguths somehow if the payment comes from a partnership structure you seem relaxed as opposed to writing\nacheck, I focus on trust and friendship first, and the fact that you don't include josh and mark in that\ncategory, gives me great pause . I proposed 33 percent of money made for you. . in the past you agreed that\namount. it will be huge, but ok with me, Ican talk today at 945 as you suggested. or if you woud1 rather\nover the weekend ok\n\nDate: Fri, May 1, 2015 at 7:08 PM\nSubject: Fwd: Picasso agreement - question\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella PO\n\nsilly\n\nDate: Fri, May 1, 2015 at 12:27 PM\n\nSubject: Picasso agreement - question\nTo: Brad Wechsler a \"Jeffrey Epstein (jeevacation@gmail.com)\"\n\n<jeevacation@gmail.com>\n\nBrad and Jeffrey,\n\nGagosian has one final change to the Picasso agreement. As you know, we have structured this agreement with\nthe Buyer as either Narrows Holdings LLC or AP Narrows LP, and given both of those entities the right to\nassign the agreement to any one among Leon, Debra, the kids, or family trusts including APO1 and APO2.\n\nGagosian wants us to agree that, if Narrows/AP Narrows assigns the agreement to someone else, Narrows/AP\nNarrows “shall not be discharged from its liabilities under this Agreement and shall remain primarily liable to\nSeller.” Larry is concerned that we might assign to the Black kids or to a trust that has no assets, and then when\nhe has to sue us because we don’t make the final payment of the purchase price but have possession of the art,\nthe entity/person to which we have assigned the agreement has no money.\n\nI think this is a valid concern and that we should agree to it.\n\nHowever, Ada just reminded me that it is possible that Narrows/AP Narrows (really, Leon’s) agreeing to\neffectively guarantee payment by the assignee might be considered a gift to the assignee. In the discussions\nwith Alan about rearranging the bank loan once AP Narrows is operational, Alan agreed that there could be\ndeemed to be a potential gift from Leon to APO1/APO2 if Leon provides a guarantee to the bank that is for the\nbenefit of the trusts as partners in AP Narrows. Alan suggested mitigating this risk by having the trusts sign\nside agreements with Leon which say that if AP Narrows defaults on the loan and the bank goes after Leon on\nhis guarantee, the trusts will make him whole.\n\nThis issue only arises if we assign the agreement. The risk is also limited in time because it would run from the\nmoment we assigned the agreement until the final payment is made, which even if we assigned immediately\nafter signing, would only be 11 1/2 months.\n\nShall I agree to Gagosian’s request that Narrows/AP Narrows remain liable even if they assign the agreement?\n\nI’m in the office if you would like to discuss this, but I would love to get back to Gagosian ASAP so we can\nhave this agreement signed today.\n\nThanks,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023351",
