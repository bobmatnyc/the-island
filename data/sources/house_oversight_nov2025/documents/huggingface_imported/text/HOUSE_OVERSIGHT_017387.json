  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nChapter 17 The crumbling wall between church and state: from separation to christianization\n\nThe “equal protection clause” of our Constitution is not the sole mechanism for security equality.\nThe clauses that require separation of church and state were designed, at least in part, to assure\nreligious equality.\n\nMy first memory of being aware of the separation of church and state goes back to the 1950s,\nwhen the words “under God” were being added to the pledge of allegiance. The Yeshivas I went\nto as a kid were very patriotic. We recited the pledge at assemblies, and some teachers made us\nsay it every day in class.\n\nMost kids hate change, so when the two words were added, there was some grumbling, not\nbecause of the content of the words, but just because it was different from the way we always had\ndone it.\n\nI remember thinking about the meaning of the two new words. Under which God? Under whose\nGod? Is there only one God that all American can pledge allegiance to or are there different gods\nthat different religions worship? What about the Trinity? Is Jesus God? And what is that thing\nthe Catholic kids call “the Holy Ghost?” Scary! But is it God too? Are Jews even supposed to\nsay the word God (we were always taught to spell it, G-d)? Is Allah the same god as Elohim?\nWhat about Jehovah—the name we were absolutely prohibited from pronouncing?\n\nThese were precisely the sort of theological questions we were not supposed to be thinking about.\nWe were supposed to do and not do—go to shul, don’t eat shrimp—and to ask our Rabbi what to\nthink about such esoteric issues. They know the religiously correct answer. Yet the addition of\nthe two words to the pledge forced me not only to think about them but to try to place them in\nthe context of my own role as a young Orthodox Jewish skeptic in a largely Christian America.\nOur school taught us that even though America was a majority Christian country, George\nWashington, in his famous letter to the congregants of the Truro Synagogue in Newport, had\nassured Jewish Americans that in this New Republic “It is now no more that toleration is spoken\nof, as if it was by the indulgence of one class of people that another enjoyed the exercise of their\ninherent natural rights.” Here, all Americans “possess alike liberty of conscience and immunity of\ncitizenship” because our government “gives to bigotry no sanction [and] to persecution no\nassistance.”\n\nThese powerful words written by the father of our country were displayed on the bulletin board of\nour Yeshiva as if they constituted the Magna Carta for American Jews.*\n\nYet we saw bigotry all around us. We knew that no Jew had ever been elected president. No\nJew had ever been the head of a major corporation or university. We knew that there were\nquotas limiting the number of Jews at most Ivy League colleges. Still, we believed that this was a\nland of opportunity and that we could do anything, within certain limits, and that even these limits\nwere narrowing, though not yet disappearing.\n\n°° Most of the words were borrowed by Washington from the letter written to him by the Rabbi of the Truro\nSynagogue.\n\n300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017387",
