  "text": "Good God! Anything is better than just giving it to Hilary and her\n\ndespicable husband.\n\n— Judy P.\n\nThanks for including Jefferson and von Mises, my favorite Galician, in\nthe list of good guys. Our economy cannot be repaired without\ndismantling the Fed. As you often point out, our monetary system is\n\nrotten at the core, as it is based on credit.\n\nI read in one of these letters from a libertarian source that Jefferson\nwrote, already in 1810 or so, that he had failed to set up a free country\nas he envisioned... and that was still more than 100 years before the\n\nFederal Reserve Act.\n\nOn the other hand, even today, I strongly believe that if we just followed\nthe Constitution, we would be okay — especially the 1oth amendment. I\n\nthink that is the most important of all.\n\n— Chaim K.\n\nIn the words of Warren Zevon, “Send lawyers, guns, and money; the s---\n\nhas hit the fan.”\n\nThe Democratic Party is electing a known criminal, and they don’t care,\nas long as it’s their criminal. They just assume all politicians are\ncriminal, and the really good ones get their districts what they need.\nWould anyone let Harry Reid babysit their children? The Republican\nParty is electing anybody who is not a politician. Donald Trump just\n\nhappens to be the best known, “anybody” who is running.\n\n— Wayde L.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031142",
