The 4 billion would be deposited in the Central Bank. But they want us to set up a special\npurpose vehicle, a construction company fully owned by the government to receive the loan. Such a company\ncan only be set up under a presidential decree.\n\nI am also told that the funds manager would be charging Maldives upfront a certain percentage of the amount\nlent.\n\nI don't feel I have enough information on this. I don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the\nfinance minister to meet them in Bangkok or some place outside. Why would anyone want to deposit such a\nlarge amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. I feel very uncomfortable about\nthis.\n\nWhat do you think I should do. Iam very uncomfortable. In addition to the finance minister, a leading politician\nand leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for presidency.\n\nDoes this sound all ridiculous to you. I have a strange feeling about this whole thing.\nBest regards\nWaheed\n\nSent from President's iPad\n\nOn Jan 18, 2013, at 5:06 PM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nas chairman of the council of europe , he is really mr human rights, Im sure that if he can be of help, he will\n\nOn Fri, Jan 18, 2013 at 5:27 AM, es Wot:\n\n| remember meeting Jagland at your place when | came with Sultan.\n\nSent from Windows Mail\n\nFrom: Jeffrey Epstein\n\nSent: 18 January, 2013 2:40 AM\nTo: Mohamed Waheed Hassan\nSubject: Re:\n\nalso be advised that thorbjorn jagland is a great friend.\n\nOn Thu, Jan 17, 2013 at 3:26 PM, Mohamed Waheed Hassan iii wrote:\n\nHi,\nWould be great if Lisa could visit us.
