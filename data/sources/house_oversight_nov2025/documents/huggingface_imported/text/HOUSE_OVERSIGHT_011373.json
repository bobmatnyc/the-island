They are asking for an advisory\n\nopinion from this Court about things that may or may not\n\nhappen. Your Honor, I just don't see the need to waste more\n\ntime on it.\n\nThere is only one issue, the one raised in 28 where we\n\nhave presented the possibility that as the party that bears the\nburden of proof, we would be allowed during closing arguments,\nfor example, to comment on the lack of proof, which is a common\nclosing argument.\n\nIf they have control over a party and that party\n\ndoesn't come and testify, we may, under the appropriate\n\ncircumstances and with the right foundation, ask for a missing\n\nwitness instruction, your Honor, but these are all advisory\n\nquestions at this point.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Your Honor, Sigrid McCawley on behalf\nof the plaintiff. Would the Court like to take a break at this\npoint? I know we've gone for a couple hours. I'm not sure how\n\nyou'd like to proceed. We're happy to address --\n\nTHE COURT: Let's finish.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Let's finish. Okay, great. Thank you.\n\ncall\n\nMR.
