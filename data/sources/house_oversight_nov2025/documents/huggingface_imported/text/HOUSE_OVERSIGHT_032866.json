I am sorry that you\nhave to appear tolerant against intolerance.\n\nFrom all appearances, you fulfill the challenge of Kipling when he said:\n\"If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,\nOr walk with Kings - nor lose the common touch,\nIf neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,\n\nIf all men count with you, but none too much.\"\n\nIn spite of outward appearances, I know very few know how you really feel and I can only hope that that\nfeeling is shown best in the naming of your airplane.\n\nJerru\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
