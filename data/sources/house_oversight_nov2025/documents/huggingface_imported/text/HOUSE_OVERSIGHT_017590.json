Especially last night Mr. \nBeckler, as most Friday nights, no? \nYes, they are the new iterations of Ghislaine Maxwell; for you Richard Beckler, this originated from \nmy being a former Stone Ridge classmate of his elder daughter Katie Beckler, and because he was \non the Board of Stone Ridge during this period in time when my every family, friend, acquaintance \nand association was being contacted, bribed in one form or another, and turned against me (see \nbelow); as for Ken Adams, it stemmed from my having contacted him for representation in my 2011-\nfiled case against IBM also during this period of time when my every communication were being \ntracked. \nYou both are interesting; you let us see what's to become of the Scalia 35 (see below; at bottom, \nGhislaine Maxwell's Jeffrey Epstein in context.) \nWe start from this following precept: (the repeating 9/11s) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017590 \n1. \"Toward a New World Order\" speech by Pres. George H.W. Bush — 9/11 (1990) \n2. WTC Attack — 9/11 (2001) \n3. BENGHAZI Attack — 9/11 (2012) \nBut you have to remember that H. W. Bush was planted: \nAUTHOR PETER DALE SCOTT: Sometimes you have little deep events that most people don't even \nnotice. One of those would be the Halloween Massacre. The older people remember the Saturday \nNight Massacre which happened under Nixon. I'm talking about the Halloween Massacre of October \n31, 1975, and probably people watching this show have never heard of it. \nThat was under Ford, and Ford may have condoned it because it was trying to help restore his \npopularity. He was going way down in the polls. But it was a very important series of events all on \nthe same night. The head of the CIA was fired, William Colby, replaced by a relatively unknown man \ncalled George H. W. Bush who then went on to authorize something that Colby had refused to \nauthorize - the Team B report - the Team B to recalculate the Soviet threat and it was pre-\ndetermined. They were going to find that it was much bigger than the professionals angled like \nRaymond [inaudible] that I mentioned. \nThey said Russia is less of a threat now than it used to be. Well, that was terrible news for the \nindustrial complex so the Team B came in and said oh, no, no, no, it's much more of a threat than it \nused to be, and that's why we got this huge military build-up. It started actually under Carter but we \nthink of it as the Reagan build-up, and that of course is a major factor in having ended the Soviet \nUnion because the Soviet Union tried to match it with a weaker economy. And that arms race which \nwas not about threats but was about fighting economic war, that was an arms race which you could \nsay that the Soviet Union lost because they couldn't keep it up. Their economy went more and more \ndownhill because they were deflecting resources away from vital domestic functions. But really I'm \ntrying to talk here about the Halloween Massacre... \nJust the change in the CIA was a major historical event but it wasn't very visible. The second thing \nthat happened was they fired Jim Schlesinger as Secretary of Defense... It was being done by \n[President Ford's] Chief of Staff and his assistant who are two names barely known then but quite \nfamous since. Chief of staff was Donald Rumsfeld and the assistant was Dick Cheney. And that was \nthe first real intrusion of the Rumsfeld-Cheney team into American politics. And they became the real \nheart of what I consider the Deep State in the 1980s when they were planning for Continuity of \nGovernment which was a plan for emergency rules like warrantless surveillance and warrantless \ndetention and the militarization of homeland security. All those things were planned all through the \n'80s - COG planning by Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney. Even when Rumsfeld wasn't in the \ngovernment, he was authorized by Reagan to do this planning. \nAnd why is that important to our history? Because in 2001, these two men were now in the \ngovernment - Vice President and Secretary of Defense - the two top people in Washington on \nSeptember the 11th, 2001 when Bush was down in Florida - George W. Bush - and what did they do \non that day? They implemented the plans they had been planning for 20 years. Another major event \nin American history but it's not usually told that way. \nWe implemented - it's in the 9/11 Commission Report that COG plans were implemented on that \nday. This is a huge change in our country. We now have an ARMY command, NORTHCOM, to take \ncharge of America - North America, the way SOUTHCOM is in charge of South America and \nCENTCOM is in charge of Central Asia. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017591 \nThis used to be illegal... We had the posse comitatus acts which said, yes, if there's a real \nemergency you could call up the ARMY to deal with the emergency, but you cannot do it on a \npermanent basis but we now do do it on a permanent basis. We haven't even bothered to repeal the \nposse comitatus. We are in a state of emergency that was declared on September the 14th, 2001. \nAnd it's still enforced. It has to be renewed every year. Obama did it every year just as George Bush \nrenewed it every year. \nWhat are the roots of this? Well there are the legitimate roots that go back to fear of an atomic \ndecapitation of the government back in the Truman era, so legitimate COG planning goes back to \nTruman and Eisenhower, but the illegitimate use of COG to deal with any emergnecy you like, that \ngoes to the Reagan administration and it really goes back to the [Halloween] Massacre where \nRumsfeld and Cheney put their thumbprint on American politics for the first time. \n-- interview of Peter Dale Scott, @ min. 32:00, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNqDAYWYFuQ&t=2433s \nThis all suggests that the start of the 9/11 agenda pre-dated him as well. I see now that there was a \nseemingly relevant 1990 event as well. \"On September 11, 1970 -- a date that only took on haunting \novertones with the attacks on New York and Washington in 2001 -- Nixon became the first U.S. \npresident to try to protect air travelers from extremists who sensed gaping vulnerabilities in security \nfor commercial airliners, issuing a statement listing a string of measures including the introduction of \n100 air marshals on U.S. planes. \"Most countries, including the United States, found effective means \nof dealing with piracy on the high seas a century and a half ago,\" Nixon said. \"We can -- and we will - \n- deal effectively with piracy in the skies today.\" \nThe President had been jolted into action by the simultaneous hijackings of planes in Europe headed \nto the United States. Jets belonging to TWA, Pan Am and Swissair were seized by the Popular Front \nfor the Liberation of Palestine. The group also attempted to hijack a jet over London belonging to the \nIsraeli airline El Al but was thwarted by security guards on board. \nThe Pan Am seizure ended quickly, but the passengers on the TWA and Swissair jets were diverted \nto a British air base in Jordan and the drama only ended after days of tense diplomacy, when the \nhostages were all released in a deal in which the Swiss, German, British and Israeli governments let \nPalestinian prisoners go.\" (http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/27/politics/terrorism-1970s-richard-\nnixon/index.html) \nThis 9/11 response sounds quite normal of course. But fast forward and the two secret service \nindividuals chosen for an April 2001 interview by a PWC staff member on behalf of what becomthe \nIBM Center for the Business of Government were (1) Steve Colo who happened to be the head of \nthe division at SAIC that falsely labeled me a threat and added my name to some sort of Do Not \nAdmit list at the end of a 5 month temp assignment in 2005 into early 2006. The consequence of the \nSAIC designation for me was the following: \n(I write) \"The SAIC designation took advantage of a devilish stratagem in which as a national \nsecurity employee (having filed out a SF-86 form, governed actually by the GSA - \nhttps://www.osa.clov/portal/forms/download/116390 - for government clearance) working a \ndesignated contract in a classified facility, being designated a disturbance/dissident/threat to \noperations, makes one, in turn, a threat to national security - with all the surveillance/targeting that \nenables.\" In essence I was made an enemy of the State and was tracked, my family and friends \nturned, my opportunities seized to include the opportunity to rear family as demonstrated especially \nin the 2007 sabotage of my third trimester pregnancy and then the targeting and eventual capture of \nchildren I used to babysit - in 2011, they were predominantly tweens - to be used for sexual \nblackmail and other forms of leverage. The reason for the use of children in this barbaric way was to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017592 \nexpend \"ops\" that were already in effect and had been used to control many of the politicians that \nhave been allowed to rise to the top (see info on the Franklin Scandal for example), and similarly \naccording to the laws of compromise, the following which has been recently developing into highly \ncoordinated murder \"ops\": \n(I write) \"The progress that was made from the absorbing of my (small) network (and this through \nsources and methods - money and other pleasureful compensations given to those willing to \nparticipate in and/or coordinate violence against me and my loved ones to include children leading \nonly to now their enabled targeting and the absorbing of whatever may be their networks - well, you \nsee below (and this only the very tip of the iceberg) how many people they've been able to engulf \nand what advances have been made by the quite elaborate criminal class employing these tactics; \nand one also begins to better understand the events surrounding Justice Scalia's passing and what's \nto come for the 35 guests in Scalia's private party. As for Scalia's passing, it was decidedly \nsuspicious as noted by William Ritchie: (The Washington Post prints) \"As a former homicide \ncommander, I am stunned that no autopsy was ordered for Justice Scalia,\" William 0. Ritchie, former \nhead of criminal investigations for D.C. police, wrote in a post on Facebook on Sunday... Ritchie also \nraised questions about the marshals' actions: \"How can the Marshal say, without a thorough post \nmortem, that he was not injected with an illegal substance that would simulate a heart attack... Did \nthe US Marshal check for petechial hemorrhage in his eyes or under his lips that would have \nsuggested suffocation? Did the US Marshal smell his breath for any unusual odor that might suggest \npoisoning? My gut tells me there is something fishy going on in Texas.\" \nAs for SAIC, the following also pertains: \n(I write) \"If you first see SAIC as what's called a systems integrator (author Tim Shorrock's phrase), \nand also the formerly married Bud and Sue Horton and their two grown sons Matthew Horton and \nBen Lanier as aids of an implementation, you can better see the bigger picture: \n(1) Sue Horton left IBM in early 2007-ish for an executive position at Tetra Tech which soon entered \ninto joint venture with SAIC (Sue's employer prior to IBM, btw) on an enormous (billion dollar) 2011 \nHillary Clinton State Department award (http://www.prnewswire.com/.../saic-tetra-tech-joint-venture-\na...); \n(2) that Bud Horton left IBM in early 2009-ish for an executive position at Accenture which soon \nthereafter entered into joint venture with SAIC spin-off Leidos, and Cerner, on an enormous (billion \ndollar) 2015 DoD award (http://www.healthcareitnews.com/.../dod-names-ehr-contract-wi...); \n(3) that the Sue Horton contract was used to grow and fortify the Afghan heroin trade (as well as \ncorrupt law enforcement) although the stated intention was of course the opposite... (\"[SAIC and \nTetra Tech's] joint venture, Integrated Justice Systems International, LLC (USD, has been awarded a \ncontract to provide worldwide civilian police and criminal justice assistance to the U.S. Department of \nState's Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL)... [specifically} to \nprovide INL with program management, criminal justice, and life and mission support to countries \nemerging from conflict or otherwise facing instability challenges. Under this new contract, IJSI will \nprovide technical assistance, training, logistics and infrastructure services to support the Department \nof State's efforts to strengthen criminal justice systems in select partner countries.\")... yet, just \nmonths shy of contract end, the NY Times reported: \"Tasked With Combating Opium, Afghan \nOfficials Profit From It:\" \"Penetrating Every Stage of Afghan Opium Chain, Taliban become a Cartel:\" \nand \"Corrupt Combatants Fight for Control of Lucrative Afghan Drug Trade:\" see also here an \noverview of the growth of Afghan opium production from the start of the US occupation (2001) to the \npresent, and especially from contract start (2011) to end (2016): http://www.olobalresearch.ca/the-\nspoils-of-war-afohanist.../91; \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017593 \n(4) and that the award Bud Horton helped secure just as Sue's contract was coming to an end was \nnot only born from what looks like Franklin Scandal compromises, but it is this contract that seems \nintent on implementing bioterrorism as the new form of explosive terrorism.\" \n(Note that both members of this family were awarded BILLION dollar contracts; that's quite \nexceptional, no?) \nAs for terrorism as an US industry, it's hardly better seen than through the following which is \ninformation of course we all know: \nWe note that in-between Bush #41's 9/11/1990 speech(with Dick Cheney as his Secretary of \nDefense) and the 9/11/2001 attack on the WTC were little more than Clinton's 8 years in the White \nHouse. We look also to The American Deep State by Peter Dale Scott for evidence of ties between \nthe actions of the Clinton administration and (1) the 1993 attack on the WTC and (2) the 1998 attack \non the US embassy in Nairobi, Kenya which demonstrate that the Clinton administration in no \nuncertain terms sponsored terrorism: \n(Writes Scott) \"The homicidal crime suggested by Fenton's meticulous research is one both difficult \nand painful to contemplate. It has to be considered in the light of the earlier instances of protection \nwe have surveyed: \n1. the protection given to Salameh and Abouhalima in the 1990 Kahane murder, leaving them free to \nparticipate in the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \n2. the failure for two or three years to process Ali Mohamed's documents seized in 1990, which \ncould have prevented the 1993 World Trade Center bombing; \n3. the release of Ali Mohamed from Royal Canadian Mounted Police detention in 1993, leaving him \nfree to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing; \n4. the treatment of Ali Mohamed as an \"unindicted coconspirator\" in the 1993 WTC bombing case \nand Landmarks case, leaving him free to participate in the 1998 Nairobi Embassy bombing. \n(pp. 76-77, The American Deep State) \nScott had earlier examined these attacks in especial connection to the September 11, 2001 attack \non the WTC: \n(Writes Scott) \"For indeed it is certain that on various occasions U.S. agencies have intervened, \nletting al-Qaeda terrorists proceed with their plots. This alarming statement will be dismissed by \nsome as \"conspiracy theory.\" Yet in this chapter, I will show that this claim doesn't to arise from \ntheory, but from facts that are true, even though they have been systemically suppressed or under-\nreported in the American mainstream media. I am describing a phenomenon that occurred not just \nonce, but repeatedly, almost predictably. We shall see that, among the al-Qaeda terrorists who were \nfirst protected and then continued their activities were the following: \n1. Ali Mohamed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as the leader of the 1998 Nairobi \nEmbassy bombing; \n2. Mohammed Jamal Khalife, Osama bin Laden's close friend and, while in the Philippines, financier \nof both Ramzi Yousef (principal architect of the first World Trade Center [WTC] attack) and his uncle \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017594 \nKhalid Sheikh Mohammed; \n3. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, identified in the 9/11 Commission Report as \"the principal architect of \nthe 9/11 attacks\"; \n4. Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi, two of the alleged 9/11 hijackers, whose presence in the \nUnited States was concealed from the FBI by CIA officers for months before 9/11. \nIt might sound from these citations that the 9/11 Commission marked a new stage in the U.S. \ntreatment of these terrorists, and that the report now exposed those terrorists who in the past had \nbeen protected. On the contrary, a principal purpose of my chapter is to show that \n1. one purpose of protecting these individuals had been to protect a valued intelligence connection \n(the \"al-Qaeda connection,\" if you will); \n2. one major intention of the 9/11 Commission Report was to continue protecting this connection; \n3. those on the 9/11 Commission staff who were charged with this protection included at least one \ncommission member (Jamie Gorelick), one staff member (Dietrich Snell), and one important witness \n(Patrick Fitzgerald) who earlier had figured among the terrorists' protectors. \nIn the course of writing this chapter [Scott continues], I came to another disturbing conclusion I had \nnot anticipated. This is that a central feature of the protection has been to defend the 9/11 \nCommission's false picture of al-Qaeda as an example of non-state terrorism, ignoring not just the \nCIA but also the royal families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar. In reality, as I shall show, royal family \nprotection from Qatar and Saudi Arabia (concealed by the 9/11 Commission) was repeatedly given \nto key figures like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged \"principal architect of the 9/11 attacks.\" The \nestablishment claims that the wars fought by America in Asia since 9/11 have been part of a global \n\"war on terror.\" But this \"war on terror\" has been fought in alliance with Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and \nPakistan - precisely the principal political and financial backers of the al-Qaedist networks the United \nStates has supposedly been fighting. Meanwhile the most authentic opponents in the region of these \nSunni al-Qaedists - the governments of Iraq, Libya, Syria, and Iran - have found themselves \noverthrown (in the case of Iraq and Libya), subverted with U.S. support (in the case of Syria), or \nsanctioned and threatened as part of an \"axis of evil\" (in the case of Iran). We should not forget that, \njust one day after 9/11, \"Rumsfeld was talking about broadening the objectives of our response and \n'getting Iraq.\" \n(pp. 44-45, The American Deep State) \nClinton's daughter is now poised to work global health initiatives which I would suggest is little more \nthan a cover for on-going terrorism \"ops\". \nTo return to Steve Colo - in the interview he speaks of a partnership between the Secret Service, the \nFBI, and South Carolina's SLED (State Law Enforcement Division) to open a Computer Crime \nCenter. Bud Horton (mentioned above) (long-affiliated with IT Security; his title at Accenture was \nChief technology officer of it's cyber security practice) happened to have just moved to South \nCarolina from Loudoun County after being implicated in a continuing child sex scandal (see details \nbelow). Further, cyber-crime just so happens to be another of the arenas in which our Intelligence \nCommunity coordinates with the Russians: \"The US cooperates with the FSB and Russia's interior \nministry on counter-terrorism, organized crime, bio-terrorism, and cyber-crime.\" -- p. 243, Expelled: A \nJournalist's Descent into the Russian Mafia State, by Luke Harding) Most would interpret this quote \nto suggest that the nations work together to prevent these various threats. The reality is more the \nopposite; trust me when I say that the US doesn't work \"ops\" alone - the 2005 London Bombings is \none notable example of a instance in which the US coordinated with also British intelligence in the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017595 \nperpetration of an attack.) I just tweeted this morning actually the following in regards to US \ncoordinations with the Russians: \"One must know a renowned Rus mafiaso was granted entry \nhttps://en.wikipedia.orcilwiki/Vyacheslay Ivankov#Movinq to the United States ... be4 the real \nstory of today's US-Rus relations is slowly known\" in response to the following comment \n@turndeaux: Peter Dale Scott, who writes about the Deep State, says Russia issue is \"a bona fide \nsecurity issue, not a diversion\". \nAbout Bud Horton and the Loudoun County matter - in attempts to make a long story short, the \nfollowing email chain: \nOn Monday, June 26, 2017 10:57 AM, \nSheriff Chapman, \nLoudoun Count, VA \nwrote: \nDid you ever consider that Loudoun was a target? That your community was induced to walk it's own \nchildren down the plank as compensation for what Loudoun had done to the young Dima Yakovlev? \nBecause now child exploitation is deeply embedded within your community with your own people \n(your own police, your own prosecutors, your own public defenders and private attorneys) protecting \nthis very system that will be used to take the futures of your Loudoun children (see more of the \ndetails below). Is it possible that that's how this happened, and you saw it not unfolding before your \neyes? Or was it simply money and just another good enough justification? \nForwarded Message \nOn Monday, June 26, 2017 10:24 AM, \nChangeis, \nwrote: \nYou reported in May of 2014 that you hired Bob Richel formerly of the DEA as Vice President of \nCorporate Development. In an April 2014 interview by the Loudoun County Police (those in the \nmouth of the lion but not quite aware of it yet but to have foreseen the ways in which the 2008 death \nof the Russian born 21 month-old Dima Yakovlev (renamed Chase Harrison by his Purcellville, VA \nadoptive parents) would have been used as \"justification\" for a (quite profitable) counter-offensive... ) \nof Henry \"Bud\" Horton (characterized by Loudoun County as a \"victim\" of the recent \"False \nstatement to Law Enforcement Officer (LEO)\" of him sexually exploiting the 15 year-old Anjulee \nGunther), Henry \"Bud\" Horton named Bob Rachel as one of the DEA guys he used to work with. \nThis takes on unusual significance in light of the below, no? \n(How lovely, by the way, this following information and the ways in which it helps us understand \nmany of the hidden influences: \"Halliburton is also involved with the Russian mob. They're got sort of \ntwo things going on. One is oil and the other is drug trafficking. Halliburton is a story all by itself.\" \n(says Stan Goff, http://narconews.com/qoffmccormick1.html)) \nOn Saturday, June 24, 2017 2:43 PM, \nMr. Satz, \nState's Attorney, Broward County, Fl \nwrote: \nI'm forwarding the below information as it pertains to Mrs. Lesley Simms and more importantly the \nones with whom she continues to coordinate. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017596 \nAs you may know, she was once close with an individual named Matthew Horton with whom she \nattended George Mason University, and through Matthew, Ms. Simms became well-acquainted with \nMatthew's parents Henry \"Bud\" Horton and Sue Popovich Horton who helped secure her a position \nat IBM upon her graduation from GMU. Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were \ninvolved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the \nexploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children \nto (continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, I would advise that you \nbecome acquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and \noff course (2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and \nterror financing (see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record). \nOn Friday, June 23, 2017 8:36 AM, \nMr. Martin, \nSt. Augustine Record \nwrote: \nQuite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see: \nDeputy Banks' attorney claims FDLE agent's credibility 'destroyed') It must also be explored, of \ncourse, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a \nterrorist financing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) \"Agent \nRodgers joined the state's elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where \nhe quickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping \ndismantle a terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East\" - and that \nterrorism is very much a well-protected U.S. industry (see below). \nGod forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as \nyou yourself report, \"As written in [Plaintiff Banks] motion: \"Defendant Rodgers' false, misleading \nand inconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and \ninvolves so many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues...\" And here \nwe see the \"whole-of-government\" attempts to restore balance. \nAs for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of \nGovernment, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the \nFederal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the \nTSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his \nLinked In profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970 \n9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although I don't see all the details yet. I also don't yet \nsee exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear, \nhowever, that it was birthed prior to 1970. \nThe initiative has adjusted in some ways over time, but homage to 9/11 remains strong. Certain of \nthe people deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited \nto head the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all know was the result of \nlegislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the \nmagical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new \nDirector of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-\nnamed France (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use \nthe NSF to forward \"ops\" that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017597 \n2005 London Bombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship. These France going-ons \nare in higher gear (I've noticed) since Macron was elected but it was prepped for long ago. I was \nworking for IBM under IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester \npregnancy was sabotaged. The story of this sabotage and what followed is (briefly) this: \nI've long-alleged that John and Avery Gunther (whose children I used to babysit) agreed to a quid \npro quo exchange of financial compensation for help destroying my credibility on behalf of IBM \nagainst whom I'd filed a 2010 EEOC (Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) charge and a \nsubsequent May 2011 civil suit. \nPer the May 11, 2011 Complaint, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther: \n3. On April 6, 2011 Mr. and Mrs Gunther, with uncontrolled greed and total disregard for the rights \nand feelings of Ms. Nadine McGuire as well as those of their children, AFG and XWG, maliciously \nand with ill-intent, wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary \nInjunction requesting formal protection against Ms. Nadine McGuire. \n4. Over the course of the previous few months, Mr. and Mrs. Gunther, colluding with persons against \nwhom Ms. Nadine McGuire is currently furthering litigation, including but not limited to plaintiff's \nmother, Pauline Scala McGuire, and from whom they received and/or have been promised to receive \nmonetary incentives, hid their relationships with said individuals, further lied about having those \nrelationships in direct conversation with Ms. Nadine McGuire and Court testimony on May 4, 2011, \nand wrongfully completed and executed a Complaint and Motion for Preliminary Injunction against \nMs. Nadine McGuire in cooperation and collaboration with said persons, resulting in the issuance of \na Temporary Restraining Order against Ms. Nadine McGuire issued on April 6, 2011. \n- Initial Complaint, 5/11/11, McGuire v. John and Avery Gunther, Case No.:2011 CA 003703 B, DC \nSuperior Court, Judge Gregory Jackson presiding \nIn regards to the suit against IBM (McGuire v. IBM, 1:11CV528, US District Court of Virginia), the \nonly suit in which Pauline Scala McGuire was listed as a defendant, the most important claim was \none of \"assault\" that led to the 2007 death of my son. Per the filing: \nPlaintiff, Grace Nadine McGuire, realleges the allegations of paragraphs 1-65 hereof as if fully set \nforth within and further alleges: \n66. Defendant Palmisano's conduct in ascertaining the drug that was used on the plaintiff to end her \npregnancy and take the life of her child on April 22, 2007, constitutes an intentional touching of the \nplaintiff by defendant Palmisano, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards \nthe plaintiff and her unborn child. \n67. Defendant Skoog, Susan Horton and Scala's conduct in coordinating the circumstances, creating \nphysical proximity and the administering of the drug to the plaintiff that ended her pregnancy and \ntook the life of her child on April 22, 2007 constituted an intentional touching of the plaintiff by said \ndefendants, and was undertaken deliberately and with actual malice towards the plaintiff and her \nunborn child. \n... 69. As the direct and proximate result of defendant Palmisano, Skoog, Susan Horton, and Scala's \nconduct, the plaintiff suffered a severe placental abruption, which terminated her pregnancy and \nended the life of her unborn child, causing the plaintiff to suffer damages including but not limited to \nthe loss of her child, loss of affection, grief, sorrow, extreme mental torment and emotional distress. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017598 \n- Initial Complaint, filed 5/16/11, McGuire v. IBM, et al, Case No.: 1:11CV528, US District Court of \nVirginia - Eastern Division, Alexandria, Judge Leonie Brinkema presiding \nThis is to say that John and Avery Gunther helped IBM defend against an allegation of murder, and \nin this way they are accomplices to a cover-up. This is also to say that the characterization provided \nby John and Avery Gunther in their April 2011 Superior Court filing for a Protection Order against me \nand their admissions in this filing of having provided derogatory information to various persons \nand/or entities in the DC area to include school administrators, psychologists, and law enforcement, \nwere more to harm me, especially in my chances to hold IBM accountable, than to protect either \nthemselves or children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. \nI also long-allege that the relationship that developed from this initial quid pro quo led to John and \nAvery Gunther being similarly compensated for what turned into the sexual exploitation of their two \ndaughters. For more on child sexual exploitation for the sake of personal and professional leverage, \nsee especially the following: \nNick Bryant I The Franklin Scandal & The Elite's Pedophilia Cover Up, \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=68gyGGPjmOo&t=978s  \nThat the NSF won't acknowledge the abuse, and won't respond even to my FOIA requests, and \notherwise has gone to extents to protect Cathie Skoog and her co-conspirators at IBM and otherwise \nis all that was needed to have adequately turned the organization towards the interests of the Deep \nState. Now it is simply a matter of the Deep State continuing to put the NSF to use. \n* \n* \nJeffrey Epstein in context: \n(As sent to the Wash Post) \nI send you this in response to the recent column entitled Believe in the Process by Kenneth Starr. \nPerhaps rethink any public affiliation with Ken Starr; although his demeanor on paper is undoubtably \nconsoling, it is also a bit intoxifying when it would be best now if we keep our wits about us, no? \nI say this from the following perspective - Ken Starr of the Starr Report, attorney for (1) Erik Prince of \nBlackwater and (2) convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein in context: \nThe Starr Report buried behind salacious detail of the Lewinsky affair almost nothing of Whitewater, \nTravelgate, or otherwise what many consider the murder of Vince Foster (Foster, albeit the subject \nof a different investigation was also under the purview of attorney Starr and formal investigation of \nthe results of Starr's investigation were drowned out by the details of the Lewinsky affair.) This is a \nbit strange considering the Lewinsky affair was a moral failing and not an actionable criminal one as \nwould have been the others had any proof surfaced. \nStarr later defended Blackwater against wrongful deaths suit initiated by the families of the 2004 \nFallujah Ambush victims - \"In October 2006, Blackwater hired one of the nation's heaviest-hitting \nlawyers to represent it - Kenneth Starr, the independent counsel in the 1999 impeachment of \nPresident Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky sex scandal... Starr and his colleagues argued that \nBlackwater was \"constitutionally immune\" from such lawsuits and said that if the Fallujah case were \nallowed to proceed, \"Blackwater will suffer irreparable harm.\" In the eighteen-page petition to the \nSupreme Court, Blackwater argued that there are no other such lawsuits against private \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017599 \nmilitary/security companies in state courts \"because the comprehensive regulatory scheme enacted \nby Congress and the President grant military contractors like Blackwater immunity from state-court \nlitigation.\" (pp. 234-235, Blackwater). (Author Ken Davis writes) \"The four men had spent the night \nbefore they set off at marine base Camp Fallujah. But the men kept their distance from the \nleathernecks. Had they spoken to the marines, the Blackwater team might have learned that the \nAmericans were already in the midst of a major offensive meant to assert control over the \nincreasingly restive city, where elements of the radical Islamist movement and remnants of \nSaddam's army were beginning to aggressively strike back. at the American occupation\" (p. 306, \nThe Hidden History of American at War), and perhaps this is the only thing that makes sense of the \nfact that \"Under the terms of its contract, Blackwater was supposed to supply these convoy security \nmissions with two SUVs, each carrying three guards per vehicle; a driver, one man riding shotgun, \nand a third man in back with a heavy machine gun. Instead, the foursome set out that morning with \njust two men per car, each vehicle missing their rear gunner. The SUVs were only outfitted with a \nsteel plate as extra armor. And the men had not been given maps.\" (p. 305). \nStarr went on to defend Jeffrey Epstein abasing allegations of child sex trafficking - \"Along with a \ndream team of attorneys that included Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, and Ken Starr, [Alan Dershowitz] \nwas successful in getting federal investigators not to charge Epstein with moving his victims across \nstate lines and other associated crimes. The federal non-prosecution agreement Epstein's legal \nteam negotiated with the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida immunized all named and \nunnamed \"potential co-conspirators\" in Epstein's child trafficking network, which includes those who \nallegedly procured minors for Epstein and also any powerbrokers who may have molested them\" (-\nhttp://dawker.com/flioht-loos-put-clinton-dershowitz-on-ped...). Otherwise, Epstein's eventual 18 \nmonth sentence by the state of Florida was exceptionally light under the circumstances to include \nthe number of victims who came forward with testimony. This is best understood in the context of \nchildren being used as a means to government-sponsored sexual blackmail and other forms of \nleverage. \nSee here Erik Prince in greater context: (the similarities between him and once (secretly) favored \nchild Bin Laden) \nThe coordinations among global intelligence to make rather than eliminate terror as seen thru \n\"assets\" bin Laden (as M. Noriega before him) & Erik Prince: \nAbout BL: \"Some CIA officers will later say that [BL] serves as a semi-official liaison between the GIP \n[Saudi intell and warlords like Sayyaf.\" \n(www.historycommons.ord/entity.isp?entity=ahmed badeeb 1) \nAbout EP: \"Handcuffed by politics, the CIA had not been able to cultivate relationships with the key \nbut messy leaders. Fortunately, Blackwater had no such political restrictions.\" (p. 54, Civilian \nWarriors by E. Prince) \nWe see also: \nAbout BL: \"Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained \nvolunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic \nRepublic of Afghanistan\" (Wikipedia) \nAbout EP: \"In his autobiography, he states that during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, he \nrealized the need for private training facilities for special operations... Prince moved to Virginia \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 017600 \nBeach and personally financed the formation of Blackwater Worldwide in 1997. He bought 6,000 \nacres (24 km2) of the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina and set up a school for special \noperations\" (Wikipedia) \nErik Prince is (becoming) no less an Amer. intelligence success story than bin Laden (in support of \nTerrorism as Geostrategy & a New World Order - see below). In short: (we note the repeating 9/11s, \nevery 11 years): \"Toward a NWO\" speech by Bush #41 - Sept. 11 ('90); The WTC - Sept. 11 ('01); \nBenghazi - Sept. 11 ('12). (There is rhy. & reason also 2 the rise of ISIS.) \n*** \nAbout training camps: \nI watched so to speak the creating of little torture pockets around the world as justified by Obama's \ndesire to close Gitmo. The White House reports (2/23/16): \"We'll continue to securely and \nresponsibly transfer to other countries the 35 detainees already approved for transfer. This process \ninvolves extensive and careful coordination across our federal government to ensure that our \nnational security interests are met when an individual is transferred to another country. We insist, for \nexample, that foreign countries institute strong security measures.\" But are these not just the seeds \nof new training camps (growing concentrated and lauded violent temperaments) & was that not \nsomeone's exact intent? \nIn real-time (and as perpetrated on captured children): \n3/19/14, sent to the now defunct FB page of D. Cheney: \nDick Cheney, \nI wonder if it's possible that there is coordination with other countries concerning enhanced \ninterrogation techniques, in the form of training perhaps? \nSpecifically, here in the United States, my sense is that there may be the use of vulnerable \npopulations, with the intension to gain favor with and/or intimidate others, especially members of the \ninternational community. \nAnd: \nOn Saturday, June 21, 2014 6:37 AM, wrote: \nTo: \nDeputy Lyddy, \nHer energy is very weak.
