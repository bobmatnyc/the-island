  "text": "he/she is dreaming while dreaming (a talent that a small minority possesses but more can be\ntrained/developed). Lucid dreamers, while sleeping, can now communicate with experimenters by altering\ntheir brain activity and thus becoming detectable by neuroimaging techniques (see below).\n\nNeuroimaging. Finally, neuroimaging technology has enabled many of these breakthroughs. As such, it is\nitself a methodological breakthrough that has enabled these other content breakthroughs. Neuroimaging now\nenables detailed location of the neuroanatomy and neurophysiology of REM and NREM Sleep. In\n\nREM Sleep, the dorsolateral, frontal cortex is “down-regulated”, whereas the limbic system is “up-regulated”,\nshowing the physiological basis for the emotional, wild-fantasies of dreams (see above). (Neuroimaging will\nenable good visual images for the TV series without extra costs.)\n\nPatrick stresses that while these breakthroughs form, for the first time, a solid foundation for understanding\nsleep and dreams, they also open opportunities to dig deeper into the “purpose” of sleep and dreams, as well\nas engender a new series of questions and directions (e.g., clinical treatments of illnesses).\n\nAttached is Patrick’s quick compiling of summaries of a few recent leading research papers (2009 — 2017,\nespecially 2015-2017).\n\nYou’d enjoy speaking with him, if you want.\nLove to do this series together with you.\nMuch appreciate and warm regards,\n\nRobert\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
