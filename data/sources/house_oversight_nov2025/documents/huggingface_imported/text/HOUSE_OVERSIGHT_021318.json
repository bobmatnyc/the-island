  "text": "vocal communication plays an important\nrole in the social connection and\nbehavior of a great number of vertebrate\nspecies. Thus while human vocal\ncommunication is enhanced substantially\nin face-to-face interaction, the evolution\nof speech has resulted in a system that\ncan function even in the absence of\ndirect visual observation. The sound of\na threat or warning or distress can have\nsubstantial impact even at a distance\nfrom the speaker.\n\nSocial impact and embodied language\n\nMany animals use vocalizations\nto maintain social group structure and to\nprovide information relevant to a group.\nEven very young children use the way\npeople speak as a marker of their social\naffiliation.° Such vocalizations are\ntypically not viewed as symbolic forms\nthat must be decoded and interpreted.\nInstead these vocalizations are mapped\nonto internal states more directly, much\nas human laughter may be. Although\nlinguists and psychologists have often\ntried to differentiate human language\nfrom these kinds of vocalizations,\nlanguage can impact us in much the\nsame way. Perhaps language is less\nsymbolic and more direct than scientists\nhave thought.\n\nWhat does it mean for language\nto have impact? If we take laughter as\nour model, perhaps it means that\nlanguage gives rise to responses that\nhave a direct effect on our perceptual\nand motor systems. Sermons may terrify\nbecause they create worlds inside of the\nlistener that seem real. We can see and\nhear torment and imagine the feelings of\npain and suffering. This is not a\nsymbolic interpretation but a real\nexperience created from language.\nHowever, just as we can distinguish the\npain we feel from the pain of others,\n\nPage |72\n\neven when we have strong empathic\nresponses, we can distinguish such\ncreated experiences from those that\noccur in the real world. The stronger the\nlanguage, the richer the imagery, the\nmore intense the delivery, the more\nsalient the mentally created experience.\nOne impact of language may be to create\nreal feelings and sensations, imagined\nmovement and behavior.’ When\nlanguage hurts us through criticism,\nrejection or insult, it may do so by\nactivating our experiences of real pain.\nWhen we are soothed by language, it\nmay produce the same kind of endorphin\neffect that placebo treatments can\ninvoke. When language binds us\ntogether, it may do so by creating the\nkind of shared emotional states that\ncharacterize empathy.\n\nIn many respects, the linguistic\nview of language use does not engage\nthese ways in which language functions.\nLinguistics treats language as consisting\nof patterns of symbols divorced from\ntheir origins in a human mouth, almost\nlike print on a page rather than speech.\nBut it is spoken language that the social\nbrain evolved to use—print is a very\nmodern invention which did not play any\nrole in our evolution. In contrast, speech\nis produced from a coordinate action of\nmuscles compressing lungs and moving\ntongue and jaw under the control of\nneurophysiology and hormones. Unlike\nthe shape of printed letters, the sound of\nspeech is shaped by attitude and emotion\nand intent, and its impact may be to\ntransfer specific embodied states from\nthe speaker to the listener.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlthough physicists have debated\nthe possibility of action at a distance for\nquite some time, the biological form of\naction at a distance is well established,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021318",
