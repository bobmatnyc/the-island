[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nCC: Richard Kahn \nSubject: RE: AVGO \nAttachments: image003.jpg; image001.jpg \nImportance: High \nMy initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. I still think that is the best idea. The stock is now \ndown 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding mergers. So I think it \nmakes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we hopefully get more clarity from \nmanagement. \nPaul Barrett \nAlpha Group Capital LLC \n142 W 57th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019 \nALPHA GROUP \nCAPITAL \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeeyacation@gmail.com> \nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 1:55 PM \nTo: Paul Barrett \nCc: Richard Kahn \nSubject: Re: AVGO \nlye had enough!!!!

Stock trading at 204.50. \nAug puts now $6.50 \nPaul Barrett \nAlpha Group Capital LLC \n142 W 57th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019 \nALPHA GROUP \nCAPITAL \nFrom: Paul Barrett \nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 9:42 AM \nwrote: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 031806 \nTo: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>; Richard Kahn \nSubject: RE: \nJeffrey \nI understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. I have some ideas which I will \nsend you over the weekend if that is OK. \nRe Broadcom: the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been a lot of \nfocus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we hear from \nmanagement as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger. \nThis morning the pricing is as follows: \nAug 200 Puts cost $4.10 \nSept 200 Puts cost $7.90 \nEarning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept puts. \nHowever I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management before August expiry. \nPaul \nPaul Barrett \nAlpha Group Capital LLC \n142 W 57th Street, 11th Floor, New York, NY 10019 \na \nALPHA GROUP \nCAPITAL \nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> \nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 7:11 AM \nTo: Paul Barrett . \n; Richard Kahn \nSubject: _ \nIm not angry, sorry, it is sad. it is apparent that you have no experience trading. we both made a mistake. . the \nspy trades were the results of a rank amatuer.. you took a postion on the direction of the market. ok. you \ndecided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper. ? knowing full well that time \npremium was running. . first silly move. .
