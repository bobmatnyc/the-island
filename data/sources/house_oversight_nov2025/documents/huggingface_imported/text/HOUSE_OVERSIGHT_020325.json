  "text": "173\n\nmid 1960s, who was caught in a sting operation by the FBI and sentenced to 18 years in a federal\nprison. Ronald Pelton, an NSA analyst, was recruited after he retired from the NSA. After he\nwas betrayed by a KGB double agent in 1985, was sentenced to life imprisonment, Finally, there\nwas David Sheldon Boone, a NSA code clerk, who between 1988 and 1992, provided the KGB\nwith NSA documents in return for $60,000. Boone, sentenced to 24 years in prison, was the last\nknown KGB recruitment of the Cold War.\n\nDuring the Cold War, Russian Intelligence Service officers operated mainly under the cover of\nthe embassies, consulates, United Nations delegations and other diplomatic missions of the Soviet\nUnion. As “diplomats,” they were protected from arrest by the terms of the 1961 Vienna\nConvention on Diplomatic Relations. Their diplomatic cover greatly limited, however, their\nuniverse for finding potential recruits outside of their universe of international meetings,\ndiplomatic receptions, UN organizations, scientific conferences and cultural exchanges. They\ntherefore tended to recruit their counterparts in adversary services.\n\nIn this regard, the successful entrapment of Harold Nicholson in the 1990s is highly instructive.\nFrom his impressive record, he seemed an unlikely candidate for recruitment. He had been a super-\npatriotic American who had served as a captain in Army intelligence before joining the CIA in\n1980. In the CIA, he had an unblemished record as a career officer, serving as a station chief in\nEastern Europe and then the deputy chief of operation in Malaysia in 1992. Even though his\ncareer was on the rise and he was a dedicated anti-Communist, he became a target for SVR when\nhe was assigned to the CIA’s elite Russian division. Since the job of this division was to recruit\nRussian officials working abroad as diplomats, engineers and military officers, its operations\nbrought its officers in close contact with SVR officers. Nicholson therefore was required to meet\nwith Russian intelligence officers in Manila, Bucharest, Tokyo and Bangkok and “dangle” himself\nto the SVR by pretending disloyalty to the CIA. As part of these deception operations, he\nsupplied the Russians with tidbits of CIA secrets, or “chickenfeed,” that had been approved by his\nsuperiors at the CIA. What his CIA superiors did not fully take into account in this spy versus\nspy game was the SVR’s ability to manipulate, compromise, and convert a “dangle” to its own\nends. As it turned out, Russian intelligence had been assembling a psychological profile on\nNicholson since the late 1980s, and found vulnerability: his resentment at the failure of his\nsuperiors to recognize his achievements in intelligence. It played on this vulnerability to\ncompromise him and then converted him to becoming its mole inside the CIA. He worked for the\nSVR first in Asia then at the CIA headquarters at Langley, where he was given a management\nposition. Among other secret documents, he provided the SVR with the identities of CIA officers\nsent to the CIA’s special training school at Fort Peary, Virginia, which opened up the door for the\nSVR to make other potential recruitments. Meanwhile, it paid him $300,000 before he was finally\narrested by the FBI in November 1996. (After his conviction for espionage, he was sentenced to\n23 years in Federal prison.) The CIA post mortem on Nicholson, who was the highest-ranking\nCIA officer ever recruited (as far as is known), made clear that even a loyal American, with no\nintention of betraying the United States, could be entrapped in the spy game.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020325",
