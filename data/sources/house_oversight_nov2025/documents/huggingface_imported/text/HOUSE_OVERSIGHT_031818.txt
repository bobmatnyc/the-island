Importance: — High

We own 8000 shares on the thesis that their growing exposure to data center capex spend would be a big positive for
the stock.

Recommendation: Keep the stock and buy Aug $200 puts on the 8000 shares costing $6.50 or $52,000. Nothing has
changed regarding their core business. Data center spending is not going to change based off this M&A transaction.
However if | am wrong and the market further penalizes the stock at least our losses are contained. The stock has
dropped $40 and | think we could easily recoup our premium if the market buys into the CEO’s reason for the merger.

If | never had a position | would absolutely buy the stock using options. | would be selling October $185 puts and buying
Oct $220 calls costing 50c/share.

My initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. | still think that is the best idea. The stock is
now down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding mergers. So | think
it makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we hopefully get more clarity from
management.
