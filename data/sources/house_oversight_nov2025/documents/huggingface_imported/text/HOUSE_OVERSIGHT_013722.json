  "text": "known or explorable brain mechanisms, one might argue that at this early stage of\nthe work it would be more desirable to simply report the quantitative findings,\nleaving unanswerable questions about ultimate causality for later discussion (see\n\nbelow).\n\nThe first EEG 4(+) was reported in a patient with epilepsy (Babloyantz and\n\nDestexhe, 1986) which was confirmed by others (lasemedia et al, 1988; Frank et\nall, 1990). An important study of simultaneous time series from 16 subdural\nelectrodes placed in the right temporal cortex of a patient with a right medial\ntemporal lobe epileptogenic focus demonstrated that a decrease in a single lead’s\nA(+) reliably anteceded and localized the first signs of the incipient seizure. The\nrest of the leads followed with similarly decreased positivity in their leading\nLyapounov exponents associated with spatially coherent patterns of behavior. In\naddition, the averaged value of the leading Lyapounov exponents in the 16 leads\nincreased post-ictally over the averaged values of 4(+)in the pre-ictal state\n(lasemidis et al, 1988,1990). These findings, including seizure anticipation for 25\nminutes, were confirmed using intracranial recordings in 16 patients with temporal\n\nlobe epilepsy (Elger and Lehnertz, 1998). The para-ictal decrease and post-ictal\nincrease in 4(+) found in patients with focal temporal lobe seizures was confirmed\n\nmore generally in left and right pre-frontal-to-mastoid EEG recordings made before,\nduring and after electroconvulsive shock treatment of psychiatric patients (Krystal\nand Weiner, 1991). Pre-ictal changes were also found six minutes before seizure\nonset from scalp EEG recordings in 17/19 patients with chronic focal epilepsy\n(Martinerie et al, 1998). The most exciting potential application of this approach is\nits use, in real time, for the prediction and prophylactic treatment of incipient\nseizures, minutes to hours before the event, in place of or augmenting long term\n\ndrug management (lasemidis and Sackellares, 1996).\n\nThere is a growing literature about leading Lyapounov exponent(s) in the\nreconstructed attractor of the EEG associated with a variety of normal and\n\npathological human behavioral states. For examples, two and sometimes three\n\n222\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013722",
