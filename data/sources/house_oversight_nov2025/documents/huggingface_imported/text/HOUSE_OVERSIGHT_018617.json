  "text": "emotionally intense and challenging, a job that can be bad for many people at many times\nin their lives -- without letting go of the fact that some people can and do freely consent\nto the job. (The sex worker Mistress Matisse has written a fair bit on sex work and\nemotional labor. And male sex workers don't always have an easy time; the porn star\nTyler Knight has written about some of his more difficult moments, too.)\n\nThe point is not \"sex work is bad and should be banned\" -- but nor is it \"sex work is\nglamorous and fun!\" The point is, sex work is often hard work, even for people who are\nnot mistreated or abused.

What kind of educational needs do you perceive around sexuality? Is there a way you\ncould contribute to positive sex education?\n\n2a.
