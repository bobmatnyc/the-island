The Board has asserted\njurisdiction over some religiously-\naffiliated employers in the past, but has\ndeclined to assert jurisdiction over other\nreligiously-affiliated employers. See,\ne.g., Ecclesiastical Maintenance Service,\n320 NLRB 70 (1995), and St. Edmund’s\nHigh School, 337 NLRB 1260 (2002). In\nUkiah Valley Medical Center, the Board\nfound that neither the First Amendment\nnor the Religious Restoration Act\nprecludes the Board from asserting\njurisdiction over a religiously-affiliated\nemployer. 332 NLRB 602 (2000). If an\nemployer is unsure whether the Board\nhas jurisdiction over its operations, it\nmay contact the Board’s regional office.\n\nIn its comment, the United Stated\nPostal Service points out that it has\ndifferent statutory rules from those\ncovering other private sector employees.\nLabor relations in the Postal Service are\ngoverned by Chapter 12 of the Postal\nReorganization Act of 1970, 39 U.S.C.\n1201 et seq. Section 1209(a) of the\nPostal Reorganization Act generally\nmakes the NLRA applicable to all\nemployee-management relations “‘to the\nextent not inconsistent with the\nprovisions of this title.” As raised by the\ncomment, there are indeed several areas\nin which the Postal Reorganization Act\nis inconsistent with the NLRA. The\nprincipal differences are that an agency\nshop is prohibited (id. section 1209(a))\nand that postal employees may not\nstrike. Id. Section\n410(b)(1)(incorporating 5 U.S.C. 7311).\n\nIn light of these differences, the Board\nagrees that a postal worker-specific\nnotice is necessary. The Board,\nhowever, does not wish to create a\nnotice without the benefit of specific\npublic comment on this issue.\nAccordingly, the Board will exclude the\nUnited States Postal Service from\ncoverage under the final rule; the Board\nmay, at a later date, request comments\non a postal worker-specific notice.\n\nSubpart B—Enforcement and\nComplaint Procedures\n\nSubpart B of the rule contains\nprocedures for enforcement of the\nemployee notice-posting requirement. In\ncrafting Subpart B, the Board was\nmindful of the need to identify an\neffective remedy for noncompliance\nwith the notice-posting requirement.\nThe Board gave careful consideration to\nseveral alternative approaches to\nenforcing the rule’s notice-posting\n\nrequirements. Those alternatives, not all\nof which are mutually exclusive, were\n(1) Finding the failure to post the\nrequired notices to be an unfair labor\npractice; (2) tolling the statute of\nlimitations for filing unfair labor\npractice charges against employers that\nfail to post the notices; (3) considering\nthe willful failure to post the notices as\nevidence of unlawful motive in unfair\nlabor practice cases; (4) voluntary\ncompliance. 75 FR 80413-80414.\n\nAs explained in the NPRM, the Board\nconsidered but tentatively rejected\nrelying solely on voluntary compliance.\nThis option logically would appear to be\nthe least conducive to an effective\nenforcement of the notice-posting\nrequirement, and the Board’s limited\nexperience with voluntary posting of\nnotices of employee rights seems to\nconfirm this. When an election petition\nis filed, the Board’s Regional Office\nsends the employer Form NLRB-5492,\nNotice to Employees, together with a\nleaflet containing significant “Rights of\nEmployees.’ See the Board’s\nCasehandling Manual, Part Two—\nRepresentation Proceedings, Section\n11008.5, found on the Board’s Web site,\nhttp://www.nirb.gov. The Regional\nOffice also asks employers to post the\nnotice of employee rights in the\nworkplace; however, the Board’s\nexperience is that the notices are seldom\nposted. Id. at 80414. Moreover, because\nthe notice is voluntary and there is no\nenforcement scheme, there is no remedy\nto fix the problem when the notice is\nnot posted. The Board has found\nnothing in the comments to the NPRM\nthat would give it reason to believe that\nvoluntary compliance would be any\nmore effective under the present notice\nrule. Therefore, the Board has decided\nnot to rely on voluntary compliance.\nInstead the final rule provides that\nfailing to post the notice may be found\nto be an unfair labor practice and may\nalso, in appropriate circumstances, be\ngrounds for tolling the statute of\nlimitations. In addition, a knowing and\nwillful failure to post employee notices\nmay be found to be evidence of\nunlawful motive in an unfair labor\npractice case. (As the Board also\nexplained in the NPRM, it did not\nconsider imposing monetary fines for\nnoncompliance, because the Board lacks\nthe statutory authority to impose\n“penalties or fines.’’ See, e.g., Republic\nSteel Corp. v. NLRB, 311 U.S. 7, 10-12\n(1940).) These provisions have two\npurposes: to ensure that any violations\nof the notice-posting requirement that\noccur may be remedied where\nnecessary, and to describe how\nviolations of the notice-posting\n\nrequirement may affect other Board\nproceedings.137\n\nThe Board received several hundred\ncomments regarding the proposed\nmeans of enforcing the notice posting\nrequirement. Those that favor\nimplementing the rule also favor the\nproposed enforcement mechanisms.138\nThose opposing the rule generally\noppose all three enforcement\nmechanisms.\n\nA. Noncompliance as an Unfair Labor\nPractice\n\nThe rule requires employers to inform\nemployees of their NLRA rights because\nthe Board believes that employees must\nknow their rights in order to exercise\nthem effectively. Accordingly, the Board\nmay find that an employer that fails or\nrefuses to post the required notice of\nemployee rights violates Section 8(a)(1)\nof the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1) by\n“Gnterfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or\ncoercling] employees in the exercise of\nthe rights guaranteed in section 7 (29\nU.S.C. 157).”\n\nAs it explained in the NPRM, the\nBoard expects that most employers that\nfail to post the required notice will do\nso simply because they are unaware of\nthe rule, and that when it is called to\ntheir attention, they will comply\nwithout the need for formal\nadministrative action or litigation.\nWhen that is not the case, the Board’s\ncustomary procedures for investigating\nand adjudicating alleged unfair labor\npractices may be invoked. See NLRA\nSections 10 and 11, 29 U.S.C. 160, 161;\n29 CFR part 102, subpart B.1°° When the\nBoard finds a violation, it will\ncustomarily order the employer to cease\nand desist and to post the notice of\n\n137 The tolling and animus provisions are not\nremedies in the usual sense of the term; however,\nthese provisions inform the public of the impact\nthat violations of the notice posting obligation may\nhave in other NLRB proceedings. As described\nbelow, these impacts are not a “punishment” for\nnoncompliance. To the contrary, the tolling\nprovision is intended to ensure that noncompliance\nwith the notice posting requirement does not\nprejudice innocent employees. And the animus\nprovision is intended to inform the public that\nknowing and willful violations of the rule may\nsupport an inference of animus toward NLRA\nrights.\n\n138 See, e.g., Harkin and Miller, National\nEmployment Law Project, Public Justice Center, Inc.\n\n139 The Board’s General Counsel has\nunreviewable discretion as to whether to issue a\ncomplaint in an unfair labor practice proceeding.\nSee, e.g., Vaca v. Sipes, 386 U.S. 171, 182 (1967).\nThe General Counsel has exercised that discretion\nto refuse to proceed with meritorious charges when\nit would not serve the purposes of the Act. See\nGeneral Counsel memoranda 02-08 and 95-15. This\ndiscretion includes dismissing any charge filed\nagainst an employer that is not covered by the\nBoard’s jurisdictional requirements.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022302",
