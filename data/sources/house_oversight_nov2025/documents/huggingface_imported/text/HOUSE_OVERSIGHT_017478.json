Many world leaders were also invited.\nOne of the events was held in the Inbal Hotel in Jerusalem.\n\nI got into the elevator and by coincidence both Mikael Gorbachov and Sharansky got into the\nsame elevator. Gorbachov recognized us (I had met him in Moscow during one of my human\nrights trips while he was the Chairman of the Communist Party and the head of state). He pointed\nat me and said to Sharanksy: “He’s a good lawyer, but I’m an even better lawyer.” Sharansky\nreplied, “But he got me out of the Soviet prison.” Gorbachov smiled and said “I got you out. He\nhelped, but without me you would have sat longer.” We all got a good laugh and shook hands.\n\n391\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017478",
