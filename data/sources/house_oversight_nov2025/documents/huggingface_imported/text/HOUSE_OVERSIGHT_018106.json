The\nanswers to these questions would have a substantial impact on the\nwar’s course, conduct and outcome.4\n\nWhose War, for What Purpose?\n\nPerhaps the most critical contextual element concerns how senior\nU.S. decision-makers, the presumed initiators of war in this case,\nwould construe their war aims.5 These aims must somehow affirm\nthat force can be employed to achieve reasonable political and\nstrategic objectives, but those objectives could range from the limited\nto the expansive. Three sets of objectives come readily to mind.\nFirst, a war could aim to simply delay the Iranian nuclear weapons\nprogram through the physical destruction of key facilities and human\nassets: a Peenemiinde option, so to speak.6 Second, war could aim to\neffectively end the Iranian nuclear program by inflicting broad\ndamage on its components and other key regime assets, military,\ninfrastructure and leadership, combined with the threat to re-strike as\nnecessary: a submission option. Third, war could aim to topple the\nregime through a concerted campaign against its assets and\nsupporting mechanisms, coupled with support to its presumably less\nWMD-desirous opponents: a regime change option.\n\nThe U.S. government has military options corresponding more or less\nto these aims. A Peenemiinde option would presuppose a narrowly\nfocused, short duration strike largely limited to nuclear facilities. It\nwould aim to inflict serious damage, but also to restrict the scope of\nconflict. Such an attack would rely on U.S. stealth systems, electronic\nwarfare, cruise missiles and air power. U.S. allies could play a\nsupporting role, especially in dealing with an Iranian response, but\nAmerican forces would carry the brunt of the action.\n\nA submission option would call for a sustained air and naval\ncampaign against nuclear associated facilities, air defense systems,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018106",
