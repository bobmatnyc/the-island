Mr. Abe’s government has continued to\npush for a restart of the country’s nuclear power program, and he heads to the Middle East on Saturday to promote\nJapanese exports to the region, including nuclear technology.\n\nMr. Abe also plans to lead Tokyo’s delegation to Argentina for the International Olympic Committee’s final vote, set for Sept.\n7, on the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo, 150 miles south of the stricken nuclear power plant, is one of three finalists\ncompeting to host the games. The others are Istanbul and Madrid.\n\nOpposition lawmakers here have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency.\n\n“The nuclear crisis is real and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way,” said Yoshiko Kira of the\nopposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month.\n\n“The government should declare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow of contaminated water,”\nMs. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe’s office in Tokyo.\n\nMr. Abe remains popular, and it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant will become for him.\n\nBut it has become increasingly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant’s operator, the Tokyo Electric\nPower Company, or Tepco, to handle.\n\nTepco has built nearly 1,000 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of contaminated water, the\nproduct of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating, and groundwater pouring into their\nbreached basements at a rate of 400 tons a day. This week, Tepco said one tank had sprung a huge leak.\n\nOn Friday, Tepco presented an even starker view of the situation, acknowledging that as much as 220,000 tons of that water\nis stored in makeshift steel tanks similar to the one that is leaking. The operator said the 36-foot-tall cylindrical tanks, meant\nas atemporary repository for the growing amount of radiated water at the complex, used vulnerable rubber sealing and that\ntheir ability to withstand radiation was not tested.\n\nThe tanks are susceptible to leaks at the seams and through their concrete base, said Noriyuki Imaizumi, the acting general\nmanager of Tepco’s nuclear power division. Anearby drain can carry any leaked water to the sea, Mr. Imaizumi said, and\nhigh radiation readings along a section suggest that water has already traveled through the drain to the ocean.\n\nThe makeshift tanks also lack water level gauges, making it difficult to detect leaks. Only two workers are assigned to\nchecking nearly 1,000 tanks on two-hour patrols twice a day, Mr. Imaizumi said.\n\nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority, which the Japanese government ordered to more actively advise and monitor Tepco’s\nactivities at the plant, had told the company to begin transferring the water from the makeshift tanks to better-built vessels.\nBut after visiting the plant on Friday, an authority commissioner, Toyoshi Fuketa, said the vast quantities made doing so\nquickly “unrealistic.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019414",
