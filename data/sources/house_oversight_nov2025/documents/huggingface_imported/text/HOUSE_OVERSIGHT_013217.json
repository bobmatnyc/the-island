For instance, an avatar might be able to pick up\na virtual screwdriver only by the handle, rather than by pinching the blade betwen its fingers.\nThis places severe limits on creative use of tools, which is absolutely critical in a preschool\ncontext. The solution to this problem is clear: adapt existing generalized physics engines to\nmediate avatar-object and object-object interactions. This would require more computation\nthan current approaches, but not more than is feasible in a research context.\n\nOne way to achieve this goal would be to integrate a robot simulator with a virtual world\nor game engine, for instance to modify the OpenSim (opensimulator.org) virtual world to\nuse the Gazebo (playerstage.sourceforge.net) robot simulator in place of its current\nphysics engine. While tractable, such a project would require considerable software engineering\neffort.\n\n16.6.2 BlocksNBeads World\n\nAnother glaring deficit in current virtual world platforms is their inability to model physical\nphenomena besides rigid objects with any sophistication.
