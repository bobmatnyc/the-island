Noticed this Guardian story about Michael Wolff's new book, which states Donald Trump\npurchased a Palm Beach property Mr. Epstein had planned to buy, behind Mr. Epstein's back. And that Mr.\nEpstein threatened to expose Trump's shady real estate deals. Do you know anything about this? Does Mr.\nEpstein have any knowledge of illegal or suspicious dealings by President Trump?\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/may/28/bannon-trump-organization-criminal-enterprise-\ncomments-michael-wolff-book\n\nAlso, we plan on running a story this Friday about the Crime Victims' Rights Act suit, and the Jane Does'\nproposed remedies. The alleged victims want the U.S. Attorney's Office to rescind the immunity provisions in\nthe NPA, and to pursue a prosecution against Mr. Epstein and his co-conspirators. Can you comment on this?\n\nThanks so much!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030978",
