  "text": "The Saudis are reliable defenders of the West’s diverse interests in the\nregion, and have been America’s principal ally in the Middle East for\nmore than seventy years. The confused notion that Saudi Arabia is\nsynonymous with radical Islam is falsely based on the Western notion\nthat “one size fits all.” Fundamentalists supporting the Islamic State in\nthe Kingdom violate the rule of law at home, and the Saudis’ strong\nefforts to prevent the export of terrorism. Saudi senior leaders desire\ngood relations with the West and see the Islamic State and Jihadist\nterrorism as threatening to their very rule. Through the safeguarding\nof the Holy Cities of Mecca and Medina, which remain open to tens of\nmillions of foreign visitors and differing Islamic beliefs, the Kingdom\nhas a unique window into the actions and motivations of radical\nfundamentalists who pass in and out of those always accessible cities.\nBy sharing that intelligence, the Saudis greatly enhance America’s\nsecurity.\n\nLike it or not, the military option most unpopular with America’s\nvoters and politicians may be its best. Bashar Assad may well be our\nonly hope in fighting the various terrorist factions that are attempting\nto form an ISIS state. If America agrees that putting boots on the\nground would be impractical and ineffective, then a self-governed\n“Syria State” must be the entity that reaches settlements with the\nvarious factions that are causing the mass migration of thousands of\nSyrians to Europe, the USA and elsewhere. The only solution is one\nthat works with Russia and not against them. Our vacuum forced that\nhand, because we are no longer the lonesome superpower shaping\nMiddle East foreign policy.\n\nWhen the USA had a narrow set of interests during the Cold War era,\nacting prudently in favor of well-defined and communicated\nobjectives, its actions were more effective. But as the objectives\nchanged, and America attempted to democratize autocracies, the\nbroadening of goals led to a corresponding weakening of results. A\nclear direction in the Middle East is imperative, not just to enhance\nMiddle Eastern nation-state interests, but to protect US interests at\nhome, as well as abroad.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031722",
