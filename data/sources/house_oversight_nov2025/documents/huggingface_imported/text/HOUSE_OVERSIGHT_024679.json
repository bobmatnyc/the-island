Historically, a high percentage of\nproduct manufacturers have sold directly to retail dispensaries, and some of those manufacturers with\nestablished “in-house” distribution channels are now leveraging their experience to offer distribution\nservices to third-party manufacturers.\n\nCurrently, distribution activities must be conducted only intrastate, and providers of distribution\nservices must comply with regulations related to “touching the plant,” including testing and tax-\ncollection requirements. As laws are changed to allow more interstate and international transportation,\npurchasers will be able to compare products and prices on a national or international basis, and dis-\ntributors who provide superior product selections and transportation logistics should have significant\ncompetitive advantage.\n\nDistribution Opportunities\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\n\nE-Commerce Distribution. The ability to accept electronic orders and deliver cannabis products\non demand represents an attractive distribution channel and growth opportunity. Companies that\nprovide digital retail platforms for cannabis products will benefit as consumers migrate to e-commerce\ntransactions.\n\nBranded and Vertically Integrated Dispensaries. We believe that consumers will ultimately con-\ncentrate their purchases with a small group of branded dispensaries that provide a distinct, consistent\nand trusted retail experience and offer supporting e-commerce solutions. Dispensaries that integrate\nvertically to offer their own branded products should achieve superior margins on those products.\n\nHigh-profile Retail Locations. We see an opportunity for cannabis dispensaries to attract signifi-\ncantly more customers by establishing storefronts in malls and other high-profile retail locations.\n\n“Land Grab” of Desirable Locations. Companies able to navigate the licensing and real estate chal-\nlenges required to secure and operate multiple dispensaries in desirable locations should benefit from\nexisting high barriers to entry and capture significant market share.\n\nDistribution Challenges\nChallenges in this segment include:\n\nCustomer Acquisition and Retention. Like e-commerce businesses in other industries, providers of\ne-commerce solutions in the cannabis industry face intense competition for customers who can easily\nchange vendor loyalties. Companies will be challenged to minimize customer acquisition costs and\nretain customers.\n\nRestrictive and Changing Regulations. Obtaining a state dispensary license or other type of dis-\ntribution permit typically involves a multi-month application process that requires the applicant to\ndemonstrate compliance with complex criteria. In addition to state laws and regulations, dispensaries\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 43\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024679",
