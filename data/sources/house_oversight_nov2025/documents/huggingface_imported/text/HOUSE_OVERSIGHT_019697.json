  "text": "CHAPTER 20\nThe NSA’s Back Door\n\nYou have private for-profit companies doing inherently govern-\nmental work like targeted espionage, surveillance, compromising\nforeign systems. And there’s very little oversight, there’s very\nlittle review.\n\n—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014\n\nPx: TO SNOWDEN’S THEFT of NSA documents, the single most\nshattering blow to the confidence of the U.S. intelligence com-\nmunity was the 1994 exposure of Aldrich Ames as a long-serving\nRussian mole in the CIA. Ames, it will be recalled, had been a high-\nranking CIA officer, working at the CIA’s Counterintelligence Cen-\nter Analysis Group, before he was arrested by the FBI. He had also\nworked as a mole for Russian intelligence.\n\nIn a plea bargain to avoid a death sentence (he was sentenced to\nlife imprisonment), he admitted that he had successfully burrowed\ninto the CIA and had worked there for over nine years on behalf of\nthe KGB. His description of his sub-rosa activities as a mole was part\nof the plea bargain. This stunning revelation shook the CIA leader-\nship to its core. Until then, CIA executives steadfastly denied that it\nwas possible that the KGB could sustain a mole in American intel-\nligence. The Ames arrest also led the NSA to reassess its own vul-\nnerability to penetration. Could there be an Ames inside the NSA?\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 209 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019697",
