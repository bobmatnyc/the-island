Jeffrey has long told me about your friendship and the respect he has for you. If you\nsend me your mailing address, it would be my pleasure to send you my recent book about the Trump White\nHouse. I'm now at work on a sequel focusing on the legal case against Trump and Trump's response to it. Any\ncounsel and background you might provide would aid me enormously and enrich the book. I, of course, would\nbe willing to talk with you on an entirely off-the-record basis or under any arrangement that suits. Thanks in\nadvance and I look forward to the chance to chat. All best, Michael\n\nOn Sat, May 19, 2018 at 1:40 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\nKen - Michael , Michael/ Ken\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
