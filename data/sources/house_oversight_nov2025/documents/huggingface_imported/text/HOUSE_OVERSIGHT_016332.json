  "text": "something to say! Heaven save us likewise from the mathematical papers which are\ncorrect and elegant but without body or spirit.” Wiener’s treatment of “information”\nsounded more like Matthew Arnold in 1869°? than Claude Shannon in 1948—more\n“body and spirit” than “bit.” Wiener shared Arnold’s Romantic view of the “content\nproducer” as well. “Properly speaking the artist, the writer, and the scientist should be\nmoved by such an irresistible impulse to create that, even if they were not being paid for\ntheir work, they would be willing to pay to get the chance to do it.” L’art pour Iart, that\n19th-century cry: Artists should suffer for their work; the quest for meaningful expression\nshould always trump lucre.\n\nTo Wiener, this was the proper measure of “information”: body, spirit, aspiration,\nexpression. Yet to argue against its commodification, Wiener reverted again to\nShannon’s mathematics of information-as-entropy.\n\nFlash forward to our day. In many ways, Wiener has been proved right. His vision of\nnetworked feedback loops driven by machine-to-machine communication has become a\nmundane feature of everyday life. From the earliest stirrings of the Internet Age,\nmoreover, digital piracy has upended the view that “information”—in the form of songs,\nmovies, books, or code—could remain contained. Put up a paywall here, and the content\nwill diffuse over there, all so much informational entropy that cannot be conserved.\n\nOn the other hand, enormous multinational corporations—some of the largest and\nmost profitable in the world—now routinely disprove Wiener’s contention that\n“information” cannot be stockpiled or monetized. Ironically, the “information” they\ntrade in is closer to Shannon’s definition than Wiener’s, Shannon’s mathematical proofs\nnotwithstanding.\n\nWhile Google Books may help circulate hundreds of thousands of works of\nliterature for free, Google itself—like Facebook, Amazon, Twitter, and their many\nimitators—has commandeered a baser form of “information” and exploited it for\nextraordinary profit. Petabytes of Shannon-like information—a seemingly meaningless\nstream of clicks, “likes,” and retweets, collected from virtually every person who has ever\ntouched a networked computer—are sifted through proprietary “deep-learning”\nalgorithms to micro-target everything from the advertisements we see to the news stories\n(fake or otherwise) we encounter while browsing the Web.\n\nBack in the early 1950s, Wiener had proposed that researchers study the\nstructures and limitations of ants—in contrast to humans—so that machines might one\nday achieve the “almost indefinite intellectual expansion” that people (rather than insects)\ncan attain. He found solace in the notion that machines could come to dominate us only\n“in the last stages of increasing entropy,” when “the statistical differences among\nindividuals are nil.” Today’s data-mining algorithms turn Wiener’s approach on its head.\nThey produce profit by exploiting our reptilian brains rather than imitating our cerebral\ncortexes, harvesting information from all our late-night, blog-addled, pleasure-seeking\nclickstreams—leveraging precisely the tiny, residual “statistical differences among\nindividuals.”\n\n32 Matthew Amold, Culture and Anarchy, Jane Garnett, ed.
