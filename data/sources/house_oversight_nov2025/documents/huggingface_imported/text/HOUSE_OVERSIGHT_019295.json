  "text": "Freedom House\n\nTo human rights organizations: Human rights groups\noperating from the safety of democracies should be\nmore aggressive in publicizing the plight of political\nprisoners. The defense of jailed dissidents was a major\nfactor behind the rise of the modern human rights\nmovement. Political prisoners became a lower priority\nas their numbers declined after the Cold War, but\ntoday there are more than a thousand in China alone,\nand many others in Venezuela, lran, Azerbaijan, and\nelsewhere. It is past time for the phrase “prisoner of\nconscience’ to again become an important part of our\nregular political vocabulary.\n\nFurthermore, human rights organizations need\n\nto develop strategies that address the varied and\nsophisticated methods of repression used by mod-\nern authoritarians. There should be better efforts to\nidentify individual perpetrators of abuse, document\ntheir culpability, and expose their actions. Among oth-\ner benefits, such work would feed into governmental\nmechanisms for imposing sanctions, like the United\nStates’ Global Magnitsky Human Rights Account-\nability Act, which allows visa bans and asset freezes\nfor foreign officials who are personally involved in\negregious human rights violations.\n\nTo the free world: All democratic governments should\nmake support for civil society in authoritarian and\nilliberal environments a bigger priority. This is espe-\ncially urgent given that laws and regulations designed\nto neutralize nongovernmental organizations, which\nwere first adopted by Russia, are now being taken up\nin countries like Hungary and Poland.\n\nDemocracies will also have to push back against\nChinese censorship. The sheer size of China's econo-\nmy gives Beijing the clout to insist on unreasonable,\nnonreciprocal, and often antidemocratic concessions\n\n1. “Big Data, Meet Big Brother: China Invents the Digital Totalitarian S\n\nfrom trading partners, the most prominent of which\n\nis the state's right to determine what its people can\nread, watch, or circulate via social media. The Chinese\nleadership expects the rest of the world to accept its\nbrand of censorship as the normal state of affairs in\nChina, and it is increasingly extending its demands\nbeyond its borders, affecting the information available\nto global audiences.\n\nChinese censorship practices should be challenged at\ninternational forums and in bilateral meetings. Demo-\ncratic governments should speak out when their own\nacademics, artists, media companies, and corpora-\ntions are subjected to censorship or blocking by the\nChinese authorities. As long as Beijing maintains its\ncurrent policies, democracies should take measures\nto prevent their own media, entertainment, and other\ninformation-related corporations from falling under\nthe control of Chinese companies that support or\nbenefit from censorship.\n\nFinally, the free world must keep faith with states\nwhose democratic goals are under threat from large\nand aggressive authoritarian powers. A prime example\nis Ukraine. That country represents the absolute\n\nfront line in the global struggle for freedom. Building\ndemocracy in an inhospitable neighborhood is always\ndifficult, particularly when your most powerful neigh-\nbor is determined to steal your land and wreck your\nhome. Kyiv has made impressive strides; indeed, it has\ngone much further along the democratic path than it\ndid after the Orange Revolution in 2005. But it still has\nhard work ahead, and it remains in serious danger. A\npositive outcome in Ukraine would not by itself erase\nthe broader gains secured by the world’s autocrats\nover the past decade, but it would be a pivotal defeat\nfor their campaign to sow chaos and disunity among\nthose who still live or aspire to live in freedom.\n\ntate,” Economist, December 17, 2016, http://www.economist.\n\ncom/news/briefing/21711902-worrying-implications-its-social-credit-project-china-invents-digital-totalitarian.\n\n2.
