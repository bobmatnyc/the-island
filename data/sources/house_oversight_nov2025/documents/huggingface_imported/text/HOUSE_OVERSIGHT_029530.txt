Jeffrey,

Need your advice.

My finance minister is telling me that he has an anonymous funds manager who is willing to deposit 4 billion
dollars in Maldives and that they are willing to lend a percentage of that in exchange for government
promissory notes. The 4 billion would be deposited in the Central Bank. But they want us to set up a special
purpose vehicle, a construction company fully owned by the government to receive the loan. Such a company
can only be set up under a presidential decree.

I am also told that the funds manager would be charging Maldives upfront a certain percentage of the amount
lent.

I don't feel I have enough information on this. I don't know who is this funds manager. They always want the
finance minister to meet them in Bangkok or some place outside. Why would anyone want to deposit such a
large amount here when we don't have a credit rating and public debt is so high. I feel very uncomfortable about
this.

What do you think I should do. Iam very uncomfortable. In addition to the finance minister, a leading politician
and leader of the coalition parliamentary group is behind it. He could be my leading contender for presidency.

Does this sound all ridiculous to you. I have a strange feeling about this whole thing.
Best regards
Waheed
