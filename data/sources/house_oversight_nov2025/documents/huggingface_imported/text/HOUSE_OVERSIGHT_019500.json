  "text": "L2 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\ntery I was going to solve on this first trip to Hong Kong. I needed to\nknow more about his activities before he got there. After all, Snowden\nwas not, as he himself pointed out from Moscow, an “angel descend-\ning from the heavens.” He had been working for the U.S. govern-\nment for the previous seven years. During that period, he had been\npart of America’s secret intelligence regime and held a clearance for\nsensitive compartmented information, or SCI. Such SCI material is\nconsidered so sensitive that it must be handled within formal access\ncontrol systems established by the director of national intelligence.\nNor did Snowden’s breach begin with his handing over classified\ndocuments to the Guardian reporters in Hong Kong in June 2013 or,\nfor that matter, in the eleven days prior to his meeting with journal-\nists. He had, as the NSA quickly determined, begun illicitly copying\ndocuments in the summer of 2012. Such a dangerous enterprise is\nnot born of a sudden impulse. It was, as his actions suggested, nur-\ntured over many months. Even if he had managed to elude American\nintelligence from late May to early June 2013, he could not hide all\nthe history that led to his decision to come to Hong Kong. There\n® had to be an envelope of circumstances surrounding it, including ©\nSnowden’s motivation, associates, movements, finances, and activi-\nties prior to his fleeing to Hong Kong. What was missing was not\njust Snowden’s first eleven days in Hong Kong but the context of\nthe alleged crime.\nI first needed to find out who Edward Snowden was.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 12 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019500",
