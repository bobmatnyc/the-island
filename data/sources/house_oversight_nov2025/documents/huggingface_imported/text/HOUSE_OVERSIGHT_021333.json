In part, this kind of empathic\nextension may be motivated by the kind\nof anthropomorphic attitudes we have\nabout non-human entities as discussed\nby Nick Epley in his chapter. The fact\nthat we are adept at “feeling for” very\ndifferent others whom we can observe\nbut not truly understand suggests that we\npossess a capacity to cognitively re-\nrepresent others in our mind in a way we\ncan understand. Indeed, second-order\nrepresentation is a key component of\nempathy in humans, and may be a useful\nadaptation for human survival because it\nmaximizes the range of individuals with\nwhom we can form a social bond.\n\nThe Components of Empathy\n\nThe psychological components\nthat make up full-blown empathy are\nsupported by distinct and separable\npsychobiological systems. Empathy can\nbe decomposed into an affective\ncomponent that includes the perception\nand sharing of an emotional state\nobserved in another individual, and a\ncognitive component that includes the\nmotivation and intention to respond.\nClosely related is a regulatory\ncomponent that involves adjustment of\none’s emotional and behavioral\nresponse. The affective, cognitive, and\nregulatory aspects of empathy involve\ninteracting, yet partially non-overlapping\nneural circuits. The initial component in\nthe overall process leading to empathy\ndraws on somatic mimicry, also known\nas “emotion contagion.” This affective\ncomponent of empathy develops earlier\nthan the cognitive component. Affective\nresponsiveness is present at an early age,\nis involuntary, and relies on mimicry and\nlinking of actions perceived in others\nwith actions in oneself (i.e., perception-\naction coupling). For instance,\nnewborns and infants become vigorously\n\nPage |87\n\ndistressed shortly after another infant\nbegins to cry. Facial mimicry of basic\nemotional expressions also contributes to\naffective sharing, and this phenomenon\nstarts very early in life, by\napproximately 10 weeks of age. This\nprimitive mimicry mechanism, which\nmay be based on mirror neurons, which\nare sensorimotor neurons found in the\npremotor, motor, and posterior parietal\ncortex of the brain that become active\nwhen observing as well as when\nenacting a behavior as discussed in\nSteven Small’s chapter. This kind of\nmechanism may contribute to the\ndevelopment of empathy in the early\npreverbal period, and continues to\noperate past childhood. There is\nevidence that when we perceive\nemotions and actions of others, we use\nthe same neural circuits as when we\nproduce the same emotions and actions\nourselves (e.g., watching another\nindividual being disgusted and\nexperiencing disgust in oneself activate\nsimilar neural circuits). For instance,\nviewing facial expressions triggers\nexpressions on one’s own face, even\nwithout explicit identification of what\nwe're seeing (4).\n\nThe cognitive component of\nempathy is closely related to processes\ninvolved in “theory of mind” (i.e., the\nability to attribute mental states to others\nand to understand that others’ mental\nstates can differ from one’s own) and\nself-regulation. The capacity for two\npeople to resonate with each other\nemotionally, prior to any cognitive\nunderstanding, is the basis for\ndeveloping shared emotional meanings,\nbut it is not enough for mature empathic\nunderstanding and concern. Such an\nunderstanding requires the observer to\nform an explicit representation of the\nfeelings of another person, a process that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021333",
