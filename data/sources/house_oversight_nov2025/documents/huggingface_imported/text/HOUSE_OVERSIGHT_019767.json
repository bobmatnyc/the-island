  "text": "Snowden’s Choices | 279\n\nsecretive National Threat Operations Center’s chief business was, as\nits name suggests, countering direct threats from China, Russia, and\nother adversary states and that to deal with these threats, the NSA\nhad used sophisticated methods to hack into the computers of adver-\nsaries. The NSA was even able to remotely gain entry to adversary\ncomputers that were not hooked into a network. “It’s no secret that\nwe hack China very aggressively,” Snowden later said from Moscow.\nHe had a planned target: getting the lists of the enemy computers\nthat the NSA had hacked into.\n\nHe also knew he was undertaking a dangerous enterprise. He even\nmentioned the possibility that he would be “in an orange jump-\nsuit, super-max prison in isolation or Guantanamo,” perhaps even\nassassinated,\n\nHe knowingly chose this course presumably because he believed\nthe value of the secrets he would obtain by switching jobs out-\nweighed the risk of imprisonment.

He had many other options. He could have\nremained in America, as almost all previous whistle-blowers had\nchosen to do. If he did that, he would have to make his case in court\n(and, in that case, the Level 3 documents he took might have been\nretrieved before they fell into unauthorized hands). He could have\nalso chosen to make an escape to a country that did not have an active\nextradition treaty with the United States. He could have, for exam-\nple, taken a direct flight to Brazil, which has no extradition treaty\nwith the United States.
