Cannot open the NYT article. But to judge from the article's title they are at least\nexaggerating if not totally wrong. This attack will not change strategy in a major way on either side. It will\nhowever raise respect for DJT in Moscow and few other capitals. That's not necessarily bad, if the WH won't\nread this change as a precedent which calls to be repeated too often.\n\nBest\n\nEB\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn 14 Apr 2017, at 16:06, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\ncolumn-middle-span-\n\nregion&pgType=Homepage&action=click&mediald=thumb_square&state=standard&contentPlacement=6&ver\nsion=internal&contentCollection=www.nytimes.com&contentId=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nytimes.com%2F20\n\n17%2F04%2F 13%2Ftheater%2Foslo-broadway-review.html&eventName=Watching-article-click\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
