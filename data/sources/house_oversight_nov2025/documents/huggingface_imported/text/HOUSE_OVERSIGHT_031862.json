Syria cannot project power to the north except with\ngreat difficulty, but powers in Asia Minor can move south. Syria's\neastern flank is buffered by a desert that stretches to the Euphrates.\nTherefore, when there is no threat from the north, Syria's interest —\nafter securing itself internally — 1s to gain access to the coast. Its\nprimary channel is directly westward, toward the rich cities of the\nnorthern Levantine coast, with which it trades heavily. An alternative\ninterest is southwestward, toward the southern Levantine coast\ncontrolled by Israel.\n\nAs can be seen, Syria can be interested in Israel only selectively.\nWhen it is interested, it has a serious battle problem. To attack Israel,\nit would have to strike between Mount Hermon and the Sea of\nGalilee, an area about 25 miles wide. The Syrians potentially can\nattack south of the sea, but only if they are prepared to fight through\nthis region and then attack on extended supply lines. If an attack is\nmounted along the main route, Syrian forces must descend the Golan\nHeights and then fight through the hilly Galilee before reaching the\ncoastal plain — sometimes with guerrillas holding out in the Galilean\nhills. The Galilee is an area that is relatively easy to defend and\ndifficult to attack. Therefore, it is only once Syria takes the Galilee,\nand can control its lines of supply against guerrilla attack, that its real\nbattle begins.\n\nTo reach the coast or move toward Jerusalem, Syria must fight\nthrough a plain in front of a line of low hills. This is the decisive\nbattleground where massed Israeli forces, close to lines of supply, can\ndefend against dispersed Syrian forces on extended lines of supply. It\nis no accident that Megiddo — or Armageddon, as the plain is\nsometimes referred to — has apocalyptic meaning. This is the point at\nwhich any move from Syria would be decided. But a Syrian offensive\nwould have a tough fight to reach Megiddo, and a tougher one as it\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031862",
