  "text": "° Both Arizona State and the Australian National University told her they would look into the matter. But\nneither university found against you.\n\n° “Based on the material available to the University, we do not have sufficient evidence to substantiate\nthe allegations,” Kiaran Kirk, dean of the College of Science at the Australian National University, wrote to her.\n\n° Erin Ellison, who heads Arizona State’s Office of Equity & Inclusion, wrote to her explaining that an\ninquiry “did not find a violation of university policy.”\n\n° In October, Arizona State denied a request from BuzzFeed News for documents relating to complaints\nof sexual harassment against you. However, Cynthia Jewett, the university's senior associate general\ncounsel, noted that two individuals, neither affiliated with the university, had complained about you. “The\nUniversity did not find either communication to state a credible allegation,” Jewett wrote.\n\nMiscellaneous facts:\n\n° In 2008, you founded the Origins Project at Arizona State University in Tempe, a multidisciplinary effort\nto understand the origins of the universe, life, and social systems. You have led that effort ever since.\n\n° Thanks to best-selling books like The Physics of Star Trek and A Universe From Nothing, frequent\nessays in publications including the New Yorker and the New York Times, and the documentary you made\nwith biologist Richard Dawkins, called The Unbelievers, you are celebrated as one of America’s leading public\nintellectuals.\n\n° You served on the science policy committee for Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign and are a\nvocal critic of President Donald Trump.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
