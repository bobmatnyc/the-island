But the threat or use\nof nuclear weapons might not look so\nfoolish from Iran's perspective. One of\nthe great strategic lessons drawn from the\nlong history of conflict in the Middle East\nis this: Do not go to war without nuclear\nweapons, as Saddam Hussein did when\nhe invaded Kuwait.

Iran\nmight accept the risk that preemptive use\nof nuclear weapons could bring on\nAmerican nuclear retaliation, because\nfailure to do so would mean certain\ndestruction for the regime.
