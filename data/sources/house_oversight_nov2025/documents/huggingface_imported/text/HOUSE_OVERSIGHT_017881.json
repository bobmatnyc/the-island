Prince Mohamed\ncorrectly submits that his position as an\nofficer of DMI, IICG, and FIBS would not\nbe a basis for jurisdiction over him even if\nthe Court had personal jurisdiction over\nthese entities. See Keeton v. Hustler\nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 n. 18,\n104 S.Ct. 1478, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (984)\n(“Each defendant’s contacts with the fo-\nrum State must be assessed individually.”).\nFinally, Prince Mohamed argues that the\nconclusory allegation that he participated\nin a terrorist conspiracy, without specific\nfacts, is insufficient to create personal ju-\nrisdiction over him.\n\n[60] The Court agrees that Plaintiffs\nhave not presented a prima facie case of\ngeneral jurisdiction over Prince Mohamed.\nIn the ten years before the attacks, Prince\nMohamed’s contacts with the United\nStates consist of one speech and a handful\nof investments in the United States\nthrough the banks with which he is affiliat-\ned. These contacts are not sufficiently\n“systematic and continuous” to maintain\ngeneral jurisdiction over a defendant in\nthis action.** See Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at\n416, 104 S.Ct. 1868 (holding that purchas-\ning in forum, sending personnel for train-\ning in forum, and negotiating a contract in\nforum were not sufficient to establish gen-\neral jurisdiction).\n\n[61,62] Plaintiffs have alleged that\nDMI and FIBS might have been involved\nin the financing of terrorism. See, ¢.g.,\nAshton Complaint 19 274-75; Ashton Opp.\nat 25. Even assuming that the Court has\npersonal jurisdiction over these entities,\n“[t]he mere fact that a corporation is sub-\nject to jurisdiction ... does not mean that\nindividual officer may be hauled before\nNew York courts without any showing that\nthe individuals themselves maintained a\n\n36.

Plaintiffs have not alleged that\nPrince Mohamed had any knowledge or\ninvolvement in any al Qaeda accounts at\nany of the banks he chaired. FIBS’ rela-\ntionship with Al Shamal Islamic Bank,\nwhich purportedly knowingly opened ac-\ncounts for al Qaeda operatives, including\nOsama bin Laden, is too remote in time\nand proximity to implicate Prince Mo-\nhamed. To make a prima facie case of\npersonal jurisdiction, Plaintiffs must either\nallege personal acts by Prince Mohamed\nby which he purposefully directed his ac-\ntivities at the United States by supporting\nOsama bin Laden, al Qaeda, or their ter-\nrorist agenda, or demonstrate that the acts\nof the banks he chaired can be imputed to\nhim. Plaintiffs have not met their burden.\nThus, Prince Mohamed’s motions to dis-\nmiss the Ashton and Federal complaints as\nagainst him for lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion are granted.\n\n4, Estate of Mohammad Abdullah\nAljomaih\n\nOn May 2, 2003 by Second Addition and\nRemoval of Defendants Pursuant to Case\nManagement Order No. 1 imposed by\nJudge Robertson, the Burnett Plaintiffs\nadded a defendant “Mohammed Bin Ab-\ndullah Al-Jomaith.” To date, no specific\nallegations have been added to the com-\nplaint with respect to Mr. Aljomaih.\n\nIn anticipation of what the claims\nagainst him might be, before his death Mr.\nAljomaih prepared a declaration in support\nof his motion to dismiss. He was born in\nSaudi Arabia in 1915 and lived in Riyadh\nfor most of his life. Aljomaih Decl. 13.
