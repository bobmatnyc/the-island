  "text": "the events that she had with these men so that he could potentially blackmail] them,” the court\nfiling said.\n\n“One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual\nrelations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein’s\nand well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations\nwith Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but also on\nprivate planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands,” the legal pleading\nadded.\n\nDershowitz called the allegations “totally made up and totally fabricated from beginning to end.”\nHe said he was not in the places described in the filing at the relevant times, with one exception:\nhe did visit Epstein’s private island in the Caribbean on one occasion.\n\n“I was there with my family,” the renowned law professor said.\n\nDershowitz said in a follow-up interview after this post first appeared Wednesday that he's\nplanning to file bar complaints against Edwards and Cassell for inadequately vetting their client's\nstory.\n\n\"I'm planning to file disbarment charges against the two lawyers who signed this petition without\neven checking the manifests of airplanes or travel itineraries, et cetera,\" he said. \"I'm also\nchallenging the young woman and the lawyers to level those charges against me outside of the\ncourtroom, so that ] can sue them for defamation.....Finally, I’m challenging the woman to file\ncriminal charges against me because the filing of false criminal charges is a crime.\"\n\nThe motion accuses Prince Andrew of similar actions, asserting that “Jane Doe #3 was forced to\nhave sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate geographical\nlocations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on Epstein’s private\nisland in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged girls).”\n\nPrevious press accounts have reported on Prince Andrew’s friendship with Epstein, who was\nknown as a philanthropist and supporter of scientific research before the criminal investigations\nbegan nearly a decade ago. However, the earlier accounts stopped short of accusing the prince of\nsexual involvement with girls Epstein procured. In a 2011 Vanity Fair story, Prince Andrew\ndenied any such contact.\n\nWhile a Buckingham Palace spokesman did not respond to POLITICO's query about the matter\non Wednesday, the palace issued a denial to several British news outlets Friday. \"This relates to\nlong-standing and ongoing civil proceedings in the United States, to which The Duke of York is\nnot a party. As such we would not comment on the detail, However, for the avoidance of doubt,\nany suggestion of impropriety with underage minors is categorically untrue,\" the statement said.\n\nProsecutors said in a 2007 draft letter they'd identified 40 young women who could be\n\nconsidered victims of Epstein’s illegal acts. Many of them filed lawsuits or claims against\nEpstein and reached out-of-court settlements for amounts that were not disclosed.\n\nEXHIBIT R\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012033",
