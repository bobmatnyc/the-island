Unlike in a joint tenancy, these shares can be of unequal size, and can be freely transfered to\nother owners both during life and via a will. Even if owners own unequal shares, however, all owners have\nthe right to occupy and use all of the property.\n\nDate: Sun, Mar 13, 2016 at 12:55 PM\n\nSubject:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella Po\n\nThe fire drill documents received should be the final nail in the coffin of Alan and Ada, ._ It is\ninexcusable, , ludricrous and in brads words \"insane \"or yours, \" unexplainable\" that the two people that\nyou refer to as your estate attnys , NEVER EVER took the time to actually read the documents that have\nthe biggest efffect on your family and estate upon death or disablity, its impossible.!!!

YOU deserve better. _ fyi, after a month of brad ada and alan\n,on the project, still not willing to share with me a final, they are all embarassed. and full of excuses .\n\nIt will take wendy and a new team 6 to 9 months to put your house in order. , new cash flows. new\naccounting system, airplane rethought, , you new hires can find deals , they can familiarize themselves\nwith your current investments , but should not be doing the accounting for them, .\n\nyour will is still not amended, ?! the tenants in common not even explained to you. if something happens\nto you and debra, no real direction for the foundation. . etc\n\nDate: Mon, Mar 21, 2016 at 4:17 AM\nSubject:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella {>\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023234",
