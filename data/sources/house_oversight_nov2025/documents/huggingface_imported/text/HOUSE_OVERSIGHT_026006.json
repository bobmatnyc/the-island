  "text": "“They wanted SpanCash and they wanted the money,” attorney William A. Isaacson said in his closing\narguments Wednesday.\n\nIsaacson — a partner with powerhouse law firm Boies Schiller & Flexner, chaired by high-profile litigator David\nBoies — argued that the bank resorted to “pure extortion” in an attempt to get its way.\n\nAs a result of the bank’s criminal complaint, InfoSpan alleged Bajwa’s partner, Larry Scudder, was detained at\nthe Dubai International Airport and taken to a cell where he was locked in with 30 other men for 19 hours until\nhe secured his release by turning over his passport.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Bajwa tried to resolve the situation but was told Scudder's passport would be released\nand he could leave the country only if InfoSpan gave up ownership and control of SpanCash to the bank.\n\nSix months later, the bank withdrew the fraud accusations and Scudder got his passport back, but SpanCash’s\nreputation was tarnished and it collapsed, Bajwa previously told The Times.\n\nThe bank disputed that it acquired InfoSpan’s source code or used it at any time.\n\nFormer White House counsel and an attorney for the bank, Kathryn Ruemmler, said that Emirates never would\nhave acquired source code in a joint-partnership deal like the one reached with InfoSpan. She said such\ntechnology would instead be held by a third-party escrow company for the length of the partnership.\n\nIn her closing arguments, the partner with global firm Latham & Watkins told the jury that Bajwa and InfoSpan\nsold the bank a “bill of goods,” arguing that despite promises to Emirates, the technology never worked and\nInfoSpan wasn’t as big a company as it claimed.\n\nThe bank cancelled the deal and filed a criminal complaint, not as a form of extortion but simply to regain the\nbank’s money after it was misled and doubts grew about the character of InfoSpan’s employees, Ruemmler told\nthe jury.\n\n“They concluded, definitively, that they had been defrauded,” she said.\n\nLubna Qassim, group general counsel for Emirates Bank, said in a statement after the verdict that \"Emirates\nBank is gratified by today's decision and the opportunity to receive a fair trial in U.S. courts.\"\n\nBajwa said the trial has taken a toll on him and he doesn’t know his next steps.\n\n“T am just beat up,” he said.\n\nPhil Hirschkorn contributed to this report.\n\nOn Fri, Aug 12, 2016 at 7:23 AM, Weingarten, Reid i> wrote:\n\nHope she is pleased/happy/satisfied/proud\n\nFrom: jeffrey E.
