  "text": "we became the recipients of kickbacks from our own government’ s aid to\nthe Saigon government.\n| do not ask for forgiveness. No, rather | must live with the memory\nof myself as an idealistic adolescent first reading about the Teapot Dome\nscandal and saying to my mother, while helping her to mash the potatoes,\n“| would like to become an honest lawyer who can’ t be brought by\ncrooks.” But my character had already been set. When | was only five\nyears old, my mother intended to buy me a copy of 7he Prince and the\nPauper, but she asked a bookstore clerk for 7he Prince, and so of course\nhe gave her Machiavelli’ s book. Mo mother was a saint. Her little mistake\nchanged my life, and | will always be grateful for what | feel must have\n\nbeen a touch of divine intervention.\n\nWe created a couple of Frankenstein monsters, and when | say we, |\nmean the administration and the media in an unintentional collaboration.\n\nOne such monster was Martha Mitchell. The first time she made one\nof her famous telephone calls and we saw how the press ate it up, we\nrealized we had a political gold mine. The wife of the attorney general\n\ncould serve as our mouthpiece for floating various trial balloons.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015106",
