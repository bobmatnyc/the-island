Agency, Inc., 683 F.2d\n344, 347 (10th Cir. 1982) (‘the simple\nfailure to post [Title VII and ADEA]\nnotices, without intent to actively\nmislead the plaintiff respecting the\ncause of action, does not extend the\ntime within which a claimant must file\nhis or her discrimination charge.’’))\n\nAfter careful consideration, the Board\nis persuaded that the prevailing judicial\nview should apply in the NLRA context\nas well.148 As an equitable concept,\nequitable tolling is a matter of fairness.\nThe Board has determined that many\nemployees are unaware of their NLRA\nrights and has devised a minimally\nburdensome means of attempting to\nrectify that situation—requiring\nemployers to post workplace notices\ninforming employees of those rights. To\nbar an employee who is excusably\nunaware of the NLRA from seeking a\nremedy for a violation of NLRA rights\nbecause he or she failed to file an unfair\nlabor practice charge within the 10(b)\nperiod, when the employer did not post\nthe required notice, would unfairly\ndeprive the employee of the protection\nof the Act because of the employer’s\nfailure to comply with its legal\nresponsibilities. To deny equitable\ntolling in such circumstances “would\ngrant to the employee a right to be\ninformed without redress for violation.”’\nBonham v. Dresser Industries, above,\n569 F.2d at 193.149\n\n147 See comments of Harkin and Miller, AFL-CIO,\n\nand Service Employees International Union (SEIU).\n148 The Board has broad discretion to interpret\n10(b), including equitable tolling, in accordance\n\nwith its experience administering the Act. Lodge 64,\n\nIAM v. NLRB, 949 F.2d 441, 444 (D.C. Cir. 1991)\n(deferring to the Board’s interpretation of 10(b)\nequitable exceptions).\n\n149 Under the final rule, the Board could also find\nthe failure to post the notice to be an unfair labor\npractice, and could, if appropriate, consider a\nwillful failure to post to be evidence of unlawful\nmotive in an unfair labor practice case. However,\n\nThe Board received many comments\nopposing this proposed rule provision.\nSeveral comments assert that, when a\ncharging party is unaware of the facts\nsupporting the finding of an unfair labor\npractice, the Board tolls the 10(b) period\nonly when the charged party has\nfraudulently concealed those facts from\nthe charging party.15° That is not so.\nThe Board has long held, with court\napproval, that the 10(b) period begins to\nrun only when the charging party has\nnotice that the NLRA has been violated.\nThe party asserting the 10(b) defense\nhas the burden to show such notice; it\nmay do so by showing that the charging\nparty had either actual or constructive\nknowledge of the alleged unfair labor\npractice prior to the 10(b) period. See,\ne.g., Broadway Volkswagen, 342 NLRB\n1244, 1246 (2004), enfd. sub nom. East\nBay Automotive Council v. NLEB, 483\nF.2d 628, 634 (9th Cir. 2007); University\nMoving & Storage Co., 350 NLRB 6, 7,\n18 (2007); John Morrell & Co., above,\n304 NLRB at 899; Pullman Building\nCompany, 251 NLRB 1048 (1980), enfd.\n691 F.2d 507 (9th Cir. 1982) (table);\nBurgess Construction, 227 NLRB 765,\n766 (1977), enfd. 596 F.2d 378 (9th Cir.\n1978), cert. denied 440 U.S. 940 (1979).\nKnowledge may be imputed if the\ncharging party would have discovered\nthe unlawful conduct by exercising\nreasonable or due diligence. Broadway\nVolkswagen, above, 342 NLRB at 1246.\nCertainly, the Board has found it\nappropriate to toll the 10(b) period\nwhen the charging party was excusably\nunaware of the pertinent facts because\nthe charged party had fraudulently\nconcealed them; see, e.g., Burgess\nConstruction, above, 227 NLRB at 766;\nbut tolling is not limited to such\ncircumstances. Pullman Building\nCompany, above, 251 NLRB at 1048.\n\nTo the extent that the comments argue\nthat the Board should not engage in\nequitable tolling of the 10(b) period\nwhen an employer has merely failed to\npost the notice but not engaged in\nfraudulent concealment,151 the Board\ndisagrees. Fraudulent concealment\nconcerns a different kind of equitable\ndoctrine, and is not directly relevant to\nthe notice posting equitable tolling\ndoctrine hereby adopted. See Mercado,\nabove, 410 F.3d at 46-47 n.8 (employer\nmisconduct and equitable tolling\n\nin the absence of equitable tolling of the 10(b)\nperiod, such “redress” would not aid an employee\nwho was excusably unaware of his or her NLRA\nrights, failed to file a timely charge, and thus was\ndenied any remedy for violation of those rights. Cf.\nKanakis Co., 293 NLRB 435, 436 fn. 10 (1989)\n(possibility of criminal sanctions against employer\nwould be little comfort to charging party if deprived\nof recourse to Board’s remedial processes).\n\n150 See, e.g., comments of FMI, COLLE.\n\n151 See, e.g., comments of FMI, COLLE.\n\ndoctrine form “two distinct lines of\ncases applyl[ing] two distinct standards\nto two distinct bases for equitable\ntolling’).\n\nSome comments argue that because\nSection 10(b) contains a limited\nexception to the 6-month filing period\nfor employees in the military, it is\nimproper for the Board to toll the 10(b)\nperiod under other circumstances.15?\nThe Board rejects this argument as\nforeclosed by the Supreme Court’s\nholding in Zipes, above, and by the long\nline of Board and court decisions\nfinding tolling of the 10(b) period\nappropriate. In any event, the exception\nin Section 10(b) for persons in the\nmilitary provides that if the aggrieved\nperson “was prevented from filing such\ncharge by reason of service in the armed\nforces, in which event the six-month\nperiod shall be computed from the day\nof his discharge.’’ This provision does\nnot toll the six-month period during\narmed service; rather, it states that the\nsix-month period begins at discharge.\nSee Holland v. Florida, 130 S.Ct. 2549,\n2561 (2010) (rejecting argument that\nexplicit exceptions to time limits in\nnonjurisdictional statute of limitations\nprecluded equitable tolling).15%\n\nA number of comments contend that\ntolling the 10(b) period is contrary to the\nsalutary purpose of statutes of\nlimitations in general, and 10(b) in\nparticular, which is “‘to require diligent\nprosecution of known claims, thereby\nproviding finality and predictability in\nlegal affairs and ensuring that claims\nwill be resolved while evidence is\nreasonably available and fresh.” 154\nBlack’s Law Dictionary, 9th Edition, at\n1546. The Board recognizes that with\nthe passage of time evidence can be lost\nand witnesses die, move away, or their\nmemories fade; it therefore will not\nlightly find that the 10(b) period should\nbe tolled. However, like the courts\nwhose decisions are cited above, the\nBoard also recognizes that equitable\ntolling is a fundamental part of the\nstatute of limitations, and that inequity\nresults from barring an individual from\nseeking relief from a violation of his or\nher NLRA rights where the individual\nexcusably was unaware of these rights.\nAfter all, the purpose of a statute of\nlimitations is to “require diligent\n\n152 See, e.g., comments of California Chamber and\nNCAE.\n\n153 American Bus Association v. Slater, 231 F. 3d\n1 (D.C. Cir. 2000), cited by California Chamber and\nNCAE, did not concern equitable tolling and is\ntherefore inapposite. The court there also found that\nCongress had expressly limited the sanctions\navailable under the Americans with Disabilities Act\nto those enumerated in that statute; such is not the\ncase under the NLRA.\n\n154 See, e.g., comments of FMI, COLLE, and U.S.\nChamber of Commerce.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022305",
