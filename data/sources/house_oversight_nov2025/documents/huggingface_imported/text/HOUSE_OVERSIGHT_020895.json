  "text": "Think About That...\n\ne Total government spending on healthcare (including Medicare, Medicaid and\nother programs) has risen 7x from 1.2% of GDP in 1960 to 8.2% in 2009 while\ntotal government spending on education has risen only 0.6x from 4% of GDP in\n1960 to 6% in 2009.\n\ne Medicare and Medicaid, which did not exist in 1960, rose to 35% of total healthcare\nspending in 2009, while out-of-pocket spending declined to 12% of total healthcare\nspending in 2009 (or $894 per person per year*), down from 47% in 1960 (or $478\nper person’).\n\ne Lifetime healthcare costs for the average American are $631,000, of which the\ngovernment pays for an estimated 48% while private insurers (like UnitedHealth and\nBlue Cross Blue Shield) pay 32% and consumers pay just 12%.\n\ne When citizens don’t need to pay directly for something (like healthcare) and are given\nan expensive good / service for free (or well below cost), they tend to consume more\nof it — it’s basic supply and demand economics.\n\ne This approach faces increasing challenges as USA, Inc. has gone deeper and\ndeeper in debt to pay for it...\n\nNote: *Adjusted for inflation, in 2005 dollars. Nominal amount would be $972 out-of-pocket healthcare spending per person in\nKP 2008 and $70 per person in 1960.
