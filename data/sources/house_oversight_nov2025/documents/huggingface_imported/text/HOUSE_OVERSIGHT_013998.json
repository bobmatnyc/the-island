  "text": "- | pair of Reef sandals. Best to get a pair with removable straps\nthat go around the heel.\n\n» | Canon PowerShot SD300 digital camera with extra 2GB SD\nmemory card. God, I love this camera more than words can\ndescribe. It is the best designed piece of electronics I have ever\nowned. I now use it not only for all of my photos and videos, but\nalso as a replacement for my scanner. I’m considering testing the\nnewer and cheaper SD1000.\n\n- | coffee-harvesting hat to prevent my pale skin from burning off\n» | Kiva keychain expandable duffel bag\n\n- | Chapstick, | Mag-Lite Solitaire flashlight, and 1 roll of athletic\ntape. The last is a lifesaver. It’s as useful as duct tape for repairing\nobjects but gentle enough to use on injuries, which I am fond of\ninflicting on myself.\n\n- | Lewis and Clark flex lock (for luggage, lockers, zippers, or\nwhatever I need to lock down/shut together). Standard mini-\npadlocks are often too cumbersome to thread through holes on\nlockers, etc.\n\n» | Radio Shack kitchen timer, which I’ve been using to wake up for\nabout four years. The problem with using a cell phone alarm to\nwake up is simple: The phone often needs to be on, and even if\nyou use vibrate, people can call and wake you up before you want\nto wake up. The second benefit to using a kitchen timer is that\nyou know exactly how much sleep you are—or aren’t— getting,\nand you can experiment with things like caffeine power naps of\ndifferent durations ... but that’s another post;)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013998",
