  "text": "[9\n\nregime had opted to fight, insisting that all its members were united:\n“We will sit here. We call it a fight until the end.” He also issued a\ntransparent threat: “They should know when we suffer, we will not\nsuffer alone.”\n\nSome have suggested that the two messages reveal a split in the\nSyrian regime. That’s not convincing. The messages were not that\ndifferent, and to put Shaaban on the same level as Makhlouf is\nabsurd. Shaaban is viewed as a spokesman for the president, but she\nplays no central role in the Assad-Makhlouf constellation. She\ndoubtless needed a green light to go ahead with the interview, one\nthat required some measure of approval by Makhlouf and Assad’s\nyounger brother Maher, both of whom have taken an eradication\napproach to the protests. Makhlouf, in turn, needed no authorization\nwhatsoever.\n\nWhat Shaaban said was likely intended to be interpreted in the United\nStates as a marginally soft statement by Bashar Assad. In contrast,\nMakhlouf offered the harsher alternative if the president’s approach\nwas rejected by the international community. It was a classic good\ncop, bad cop routine, and those familiar with Syrian manners will be\nlittle surprised by the ploy. That’s why it seems far-fetched to assume\nthat we are witnessing a fundamental rift in Syria’s ruling family.\nThe reason for this is that there is no serious alternative to what the\nAssads and the Makhloufs are doing today. They can either stand\ntogether behind repression, or fall apart. That’s hardly to justify the\nregime’s butchery of hundreds of unarmed civilians. Rather, it’s to\naffirm that the Syrian leadership is incapable of undertaking anything\ndifferent. There simply is no reform option, and there never was.\nGenuine reform means dislodging the bricks holding up Assad-\nMakhlouf authority. Bashar Assad’s open-ended presidency, the\ncrony capitalism practiced by his cousin and other members of\nSyria’s elite, the abuse practiced by the all-powerful security services,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030078",
