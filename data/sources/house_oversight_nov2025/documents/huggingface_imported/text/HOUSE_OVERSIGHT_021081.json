The present value depends on the\nrate of interest used (the discount rate). For\nexample, if $100 is invested on January 1 at\nan annual interest rate of 5 percent, it will\ngrow to $105 by January 1 of the next year.\nHence, at an annual 5 percent interest rate,\nthe present value of $105 payable a year\nfrom today is $100.\n\nPatient Protection and Affordable Care\nAct (PPACA) — A federal statute as the\nresult of the healthcare reform. Signed into\nlaw on 3/23/10, the PPACA aims to expand\nMedicaid eligibility, incentivize businesses to\nprovide health care benefits, prohibit denial\nof coverage/claims based on pre-existing\nconditions, establish health insurance\nexchanges, and support for medical\nresearch. The costs of these provisions are\noffset by a variety of taxes, fees, and cost-\nsaving measures, such as new Medicare\ntaxes for high-income brackets, taxes on\nindoor tanning, improved fairness in the\nMedicare Advantage program relative to\ntraditional Medicare, and fees on medical\ndevices and pharmaceutical companies.\n\n_)\nIse) www.kpcb.com\n\nProductivity - Average real output per unit\nof input.

Tax breaks are one method\nCongress uses to promote certain policy\nobjectives.
