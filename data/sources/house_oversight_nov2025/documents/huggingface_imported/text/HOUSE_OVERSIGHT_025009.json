  "text": "managed their expectations?\n\nPalestinians know exactly what's happening. People don't have high\nexpectations.... But maybe the Palestinian leadership should tell the\npeople that after 20 years we don't have a partner and we cannot\ncontinue to be an authority in name only. That we should throw in the\ntowel.\n\nMany see that as a bluff. Wouldn't you be throwing away years of\nprogress, institutions, security forces and putting hundreds of\nthousands of people out of work?\n\nWe haven't made a decision. I'm not asking for the disbanding of the\nauthority. But I'm asking: Is this the authority that will take us to\nindependence? It's a joke.... The status quo is the worst situation for\nus, worse than any storm that might come. I'm not in a position to\nbluff or make threats. It's about choices.\n\nIt sounds like you are hoping that Israel will cry uncle.\n\nEighteen years ago I would have accepted this argument. But now I'm\na grandpa. I used to tell my wife that I never wanted my children to\ngo through what I went through, but then they did. And I didn't want\nmy grandchildren to go through it, and they are.\n\nHow does any of this get Israelis and Palestinians closer to an\nagreement or get Palestinians closer to statehood?\n\nAt least I won't be looking in the mirror and telling myself that I'm\nfooling my people.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025009",
