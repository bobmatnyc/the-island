NOT before. !\n\ntrump first put the most disadvantaged the UNEMPLOYED first. . and with great\nsuccess. can you imagine the attacks if wages went up , but the blacks and hispanics\nwere still without work. He needs to be given TIME . the first play has worked.\n\nhe believes in a winning game strategy, you can't judge it because he hasn't scored a\ntouchdown from way in his own backfield. ( ball given to him by obama on his own 10\nyard line ) he has moved the ball way up the field. and the dems can see the\ntouchdown coming. yes there have been some fumbles along the way, no question. and\nsome have been taken off the field. but the horror and the dems faces is they see the\nteam has progressed in spite of all the yellow flags and cries of foul. There ( sic\n) defense is maxine waters and nancy pelosi ) donalds offense is pompeo mattis and\nkelly. they don't have to like the quarterback they just have to win,\n\nSender: e:jeeitunes@gmail.com\n\nTime: 09/14/18 04:18:23 AM (558616703)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025393",
