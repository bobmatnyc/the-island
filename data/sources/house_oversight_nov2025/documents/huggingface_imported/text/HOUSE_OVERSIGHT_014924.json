  "text": "¢ — Instant Book impact: The Instant Book transition could impact meta rates and total\nmonetization as more hotel shoppers flow through large OTA partners.\n\n¢ Hotel Shopper growth: Given elevated marketing spend, we expect to see a rebound\nin hotel shopper and hotel revenue growth. 4Q16 hotel shopper growth accelerated\nfrom 3% in 2Q-3Q16 to 8%. We expect hotel shopper growth to decelerate slightly\nto 6% in 1Q17 on a 200bps tougher y/y comp.\n\n1Q traffic data points: comScore indicates solid mobile and PC user growth\n\nIn the US, comScore reported quarter to date through February, average monthly unique\nvisitors of 31mn on PC and 56mn on mobile, up 24% and up 3% y/y, respectively.\nTripAdvisor total minutes in 1Q through February is up 10%, with mobile minutes up 5%\nand PC minutes up 17%. In our view, TripAdvisor’s elevated marketing spend YTD likely\ntargets higher monetizing PC traffic.\n\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Broadly in-line on Revenue, below on EBITDA/EPS\nOur 1Q revenue estimate of $379mn is broadly in line with the Street at $377mn. We\nare more cautious on EBITDA and EPS at $71mn/S0.23 vs. the Street at $76mn/S0.27.\n\nTable 25: TripAdvisor estimate summary\n\n1Q17 2017 2017 2018 2019\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $379 $432 $1,647 $1,794 $1,936\nGrowth Y/Y% 8% 10% 11% 9% 8%\nStreet $377 $433 $1,649 $1,852 $2,095\nBofAML vs. Street Above Below Below Below Below\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. $71 $88 $346 $403 $471\nStreet $76 $88 $339 $392 $530\nBofAML vs. Street Below Above Above Above Below\nEPS\nBofAML est. $0.23 $0.31 $1.22 $1.57 $1.89\nStreet $0.27 $0.32 $1.23 $1.48 $2.28\nBofAML vs. Street Below Below Below Above Below\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\n\nOur price objective of $40 is based on 25x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate.
