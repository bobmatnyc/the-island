You are going to love my new\narea of expertise! | am having such an amazing time over here!!” | had to\nlet him know how much I appreciated what he had done for me and he\nloved the head swell that it would make him feel as well. Hating the\nthought of going back to him, I wasn’t going to let that put a damper on\nmy spirits while I was still out there. It was my time to party harder than\never before. Every night was a new adventure for me. Chang-Mai was a\nmaze of places to get lost in and the vibrant city was my playground. The\nway | saw it this was my last chance to get out and break free, letting\nloose my inner girl it felt so good to take the lead of my own life.\n\nChapter 21\n\nIt was an average evening getting ready in front of the bathroom mirror\non just an average Sunday, though unbeknownst to us girls as we sat\nthere chatting away carelessly, this night was already written in the stars\nfor me. It was a very long time ago now when I was still a young child\nthat I sat looking up to those same stars from my bedroom window with\nmy hands pressed tightly together as I cried for God to hear my prayers.\nAll 1 asked him for was death. My precious life was already such a\nhopeless battle that I felt too small to fight alone for. Begging him to\ndeliver me from this cruel world I would pray for all of my pain would to\naway for good. My only clause in my prayers was the possibility that\nthere was somebody in this wide world that I was meant to love,\nsomething much bigger than I could have even imagined yet. This\ninvocation of mine was forgotten about long ago now, until tonight.\n\nI wish [ had known that night I sat crying beneath the stars that it\nwould all be different one day and that [ hadn’t sold myself short to the\naccustomed lifestyle 1 was brought up to believing was acceptable. It was\nthis night my very soul was about to cosmically collide with the man I\nwas always meant for, the man my heart already belonged to and would\nknow from the instant we met. This night would be the first day to the\nbeginning of my new life to come.\n\nI blushed my cheeks and put on my mascara before me and my\ngirlfriend headed out to hit the town. We were dressed to kill and looking\nfor something to do when we ran into a few of our class mates at one of\nour favorite drinking spots. They were meeting up for some drinks before\na Muay-Thai kickboxing tournament. It sounded like fun when they\ninvited us along to watch it with them. The massive crowd lined the street\nwhere the fight was being held and once I got inside the arena it was push\n\nLi Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004254\n\nand shove to try to find a spot to watch from. The friends that we were\nhanging out with were meeting up with another group of guys that were\ntraining for the kickboxing tournaments that we were watching.\n\nThen it happened it was the first moment I laid eyes on the man that\nwould love me for the rest of my life. I wasn’t expecting the most\namazing time of my life to happen right there and then but it did and I\nwould never be the same again. Destiny fell right smack into my lap and\nthere was no stopping it! It wasn’t just his smoldering appeal that was\nobvious at first sight it was the entire package of mannerism and chivalry\nthat made him stand out of the crowd. Stepping right out of the pages of\nthe fairytales I used to read, he was nothing like | had ever come to know\nbefore.\n\nWatching him from a close distance he was playfully shadow boxing\none of the guys from my massage class and it was at that moment that\nthis handsome stranger first caught me staring at him. From top to toe this\nathletically built man was intriguing to watch, | couldn’t take my eyes off\nhim like [ was magnetically drawn to his power of attraction. He further\ninterested me when he wasn’t acting like the majority of harping dogs\nthat would jump at the eyes I was giving him now. Instead he coyly\nplayed hard to get, making me work for any conversation with him. The\nfight started and the men were going bezerk, screaming at the fighters in\nthe ring offering either fighter their support or discrimination depending\n\non whom they were batting for. It was like watching a primitive scene out\n\nof the days when the cavemen ruled the earth but it was as equally\nalluring to watch unfold, the sweat, the blood and the absolute brut\nfascination of it all.\n\nAfter the fight and all of the men revved up from the fight, I suggested\nthat we all head to the pizza joint in front of the Princess Hotel where |\nwas staying for a late night snack. I made it my goal to make myself\nknown to this appealing stranger. In the tuk-tuk on the way there [ made\nsure I sat next to Robbie. Scooting my knees closer and closer to him on\nthe short ride he continued his chase by moving further away from me, a\ngame of cat and mouse that I loved. When he answered back the array of\nmy questions he had the cutest Aussie accent that drove me absolutely\nwild.\n\nGradually we got to know each other better over a pie of peperoni\npizza and two can’s of coke. Too me he might as well have been the only\nother person in the restaurant, he knew he had my undivided attention and\nI think he liked it. There was no one like him that [ had ever met before\nand I knew there was no other who could make me feel the way that I felt\nat the first sight of him.
