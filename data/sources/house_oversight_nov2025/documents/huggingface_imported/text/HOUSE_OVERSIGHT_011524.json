  "text": "so, would suddenly give way to a windswept series of dunes and wadis. The\nmap and compass helped. But I soon realized that it was almost impossible to\nget an accurate reading from inside the truck. Every few minutes, I waved the\nconvoy to stop, got out, and walked fifty or sixty yards into the sand and clumps\nof acacia trees and calibrated our progress from there. My fallback was the\nstars. From them, I could at least make sure we were headed in broadly the right\ndirection. But the need to navigate around the dunes meant we were never\nmoving in a perfectly straight line. The miles ticking by on the truck’s odometer\ncouldn’t tell me exactly how far we’d travelled. A couple of times, I realized we\nwere wandering off line — not by a much, but enough to risk leaving us either a\nmile or two south of where we were supposed to go or, worse, on the Egyptian\nside of an unmarked desert frontier that, especially at night, would look pretty\nmuch the same on either side.\n\nFinally, a few hours before dawn, I brought the convoy to a halt. I climbed\nout, walked back to the staff sergeant and told him, with more confidence than I\nfelt: “We’re here.” I had no way of knowing for sure. But I felt we were\ngenerally in the right place. Before we’d set off, I was briefed by the officer in\ncharge of one of the operational APC battalions. He had been to the area before,\non training exercises. Because of the emergency call-up, he was too senior to\nlead a supply convoy. But he told me that once we got there, we should stop and\nwait. He would follow our tracks the next morning and link up with us. An hour\nafter sunrise, we saw his jeep bobbing over the sand towards us. He pulled to a\nstop, shook hands with the staff sergeant, and then he turned to me.\n“Unbelievable,” he said. ““We’re where we need to be.”\n\nOur role in the grand scheme of things, and certainly mine, was hardly\ndecisive. But the rest of the border mobilization also went to plan. That, along\nwith some frantic diplomatic activity and a healthy common sense on all sides,\nensured that a new war with Egypt was averted — at least for a further half-\ndozen years, until 1967. By then, the lesson of Rotem would be learned: our\nneed to find a realiable way to tap into the battle plans of the hostile Arab states\naround us. And through another wholly unexpected turn of events starting just a\nfew weeks after the Rotem Crisis, I would turn out to play a personal role in\nmaking that happen.\n\n53\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011524",
