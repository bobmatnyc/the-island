To both\nKushner and McMaster it seemed obvious that the president was more annoyed about\nhaving to think about the attack than by the attack itself.\n\nFinally, Ivanka told Dina they needed to show the president a different kind of\npresentation. Ivanka had long ago figured out how to make successful pitches to her\nfather. You had to push his enthusiasm buttons. He may be a businessman, but numbers\ndidn’t do it for him. He was not a spreadsheet jockey—his numbers guys dealt with\nspreadsheets. He liked big names. He liked the big picture—he liked /iteral big pictures.\nHe liked to see it. He liked “impact.”\n\nBut in one sense, the military, the intelligence community, and the White House’s\nnational security team remained behind the times. Theirs was a data world rather than a\npicture world. As it happened, the attack on Khan Sheikhoun had produced a wealth of\nvisual evidence. Bannon might be right that this attack was no more mortal than countless\nothers, but by focusing on this one and curating the visual proof, this atrocity became\nsingular.\n\nLate that afternoon, Ivanka and Dina created a presentation that Bannon, in disgust,\ncharacterized as pictures of kids foaming at the mouth. When the two women showed the\npresentation to the president, he went through it several times. He seemed mesmerized.\n\nWatching the president’s response, Bannon saw Trumpism melting before his eyes.\nTrump—despite his visceral resistance to the establishment ass-covering and standard-\nissue foreign policy expertise that had pulled the country into hopeless wars—was\nsuddenly putty. After seeing all the horrifying photos, he immediately adopted a\ncompletely conventional point of view: it seemed inconceivable to him that we couldn’t\ndo something.\n\nThat evening, the president described the pictures in a call to a friend—the foam, all\nthat foam. These are just kids. He usually displayed a consistent contempt for anything but\noverwhelming military response; now he expressed a sudden, wide-eyed interest in all\nkinds of other military options.\n\nOn Wednesday, April 5, Trump received a briefing that outlined multiple options for\nhow to respond. But again McMaster burdened him with detail. He quickly became\nfrustrated, feeling that he was being manipulated.\n\nThe following day, the president and several of his top aides flew to Florida for a\nmeeting with the Chinese president, Xi Jinping—a meeting organized by Kushner with the\nhelp of Henry Kissinger. While aboard Air Force One, he held a tightly choreographed\nmeeting of the National Security Council, tying into the staff on the ground. By this point,\nthe decision about how to respond to the chemical attack had already been made: the\nmilitary would launch a Tomahawk cruise missile strike at Al Shayrat airfield.
