  "text": "of lifetimes of states, observable at almost any temporal resolution that methods\n\nwould allow.\n\nEarly and representative studies comparing the fit of the data with\nhierarchical scaling functions versus a sum of a small number of Markovian\nexponentials included studies of a calcium activated potassium channel in human\nfibroblasts (Stockbridge and French, 1989) which yielded evidence to support both\nmodels, as did studies of membrane conductances in corneal epithelial cells by\nanother group (Korn and Horn, 1988). In a systematic comparison of scaling and\nMarkov exponential modes of the gating kinetics of GABA activated chloride\nchannels, acetylcholine activated end plate potentials, calcium activated potassium\nchannels and fast chloride channels (McManus et al, 1988), it was found that the\nlatter fit the data best in most experiments. Similar results were reported in studies\nof the glutamate and delayed rectifier potassium channel with respect to\ndistributions of open and closed times (Sansom et al, 1989). Space does not permit\na systematic account of the continuing debate and conflicting studies about these\nrepresentations and the implicit biophysics of discrete, finite versus continuous,\nhierarchical channel event heterogeneity. It is interesting that recent experiments\nmaking use of Hurst rescaled range analyses of time series of whole cell membrane\nvoltage fluctuations (without the assumptions and current renormalizing procedures\nassociated with patch clamping) have yielded additional evidence for multiply\ncorrelated, Hurst > 0.5, a < 2 power law behavior of what some might regard more\ngenerally as a protein relaxation time mediated hierarchical array of ion\n\nconductance behaviors (Liebovitch and Todorov, 1996).\n\nFollowing the discovery of (very) subsaturating (“far from equilibrium”) rat\nbrain levels of the common cofactor for tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases,\ntetrahydrobiopterin (Bullard et al, 1978), studies of amino acid substrate saturation\nfunctions and time courses determined at these low, physiological co-reactant\nconcentrations manifested patterns of hierarchical multiplicity and discontinuities\nsuggestive of bifurcations and time-dependent fluctuations with fractional\n\n(hierarchical) time scaling exponents that were sensitive to psychotropic drugs\n\n212\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013712",
