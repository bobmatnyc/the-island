Yes.\n\nQ. As of December --\n\nA. I believe I was counsel of record on all\nthree of those. I would have to double-check. I know I\nwas counsel of record in the federal case. The two of\nthem are state cases, I believe, that it was pro hac in\nthe state cases,\n\nQ. Okay. I won't ask you the names, but in the\nfour cases, what are the initials of your clients?\n\nA. Okay. So the -- the --\n\nQ. Put it this way: How are they identified in\n\nthe caption that you filed?\n\nA. Well, also the three that were filed, one\nwas ~~ one was the initials S.R. I referred to\nMiss S.R. yesterday. That was the Jane Doe case in\nFederal Court in front of Judge Marra.\n\nThere were two state claims. I'll -- I'll\n\nidentify the clients as E.W. and L.M.\n\nQ. And then the fourth one?\n\nA. The fourth one, I believe -- the initial M.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n261\nand I believe the last initial was B., but I may be\nwrong about the B. First initial M.\n\nQ. At the -- okay. At the time that you filed\nthe joinder motion --\n\nA. Yes,\n\nQ.  -- in the federal case, so December 30th of\n2014, you knew that naming Prince Andrew would generate\nsubstantial publicity, correct?\n\nA. I knew it would attract a lot of attention.\nYeah, I mean, “substantial” we could debate, but, sure,\nI knew that that was going to -- you know, once you\nstart exposing the extent of this criminal activity,\nobviously, there were going to be a lot of people\ninterested, yes.\n\nQ. And you also knew that naming Professor\nDershowitz would attract publicity?\n\nA. Well, when you say \"naming,\" one of the\nthings you've got to understand is the names were\nalready in the case, both Prince Andrew and Alan\nDershowitz. We had pending discovery requests for\ninformation about both of them. So when you say \"naming\nthem,” you know, they were already named in the case.\n\nNow, would the additional allegations have\nattracted additional attention? Sure.\n\nQ.

If you're talking about direct allegation,\nthat’s correct.\n\nQ. Had you ever public -- well, at no other time\nthat -- you expected when you filed the pleading on\nDecember 30th, 2014, that it would be -- be something of\npublic record that would generate publicity, correct?\n\nA. Public record, the focus was not generating\npublicity. Of course, when you file an allegation like\nthat, there certainly would have been -- we would\nanticipate there would have been publicity, absolutely.\n\nQ. And before December 30th of 2014, to the best\nof your knowledge, neither you, nor anyone else, had\ntold Professor Dershowitz that there were allegations\nthat he personally had engaged in sexual misconduct?\n\nA. um...\n\nMS.

SIMPSON: No. These are communications\nto Professor Dershowitz.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n263\nMR. SCAROLA: Yes.

My question is: Did you ever advise\nProfessor Dershowitz that there were allegations that he\nhad engaged, himself, in sexual misconduct with minors?\n\nA. Not me personally, no.\n\nQ. Are you aware of any e-mail, letter, other\ncommunication from anybody that went to Professor\nDershowitz that told Professor Dershowitz that he had\nbeen accused of engaging in misconduct himself?\n\nA. Well, there -- I mean, I'm aware that there\nwas a deposition request in 2009. There was a\ndeposition request in 2011. That was accompanied by an\nexchange of correspondence that said, for example,\nnumerous witnesses have placed you in the presence of\nJeffrey Epstein and underaged girls. It didn't then go\non to say, and you were committing sexual abuse of them,\nbut it said numerous witnesses had -- had done that.\n\nAnd I think a reasonable inference would be\nthat, you know, you're verily sure that a witness and\nthen that also raises the possibility of -- well, I\nmean, I think Professor Dershowitz mentioned yesterday,\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\nPage 260 to 263 of 335\n\n28 of 46 sheets\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010868",
