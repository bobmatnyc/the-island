For\nconvenience, this Article discusses the proposed changes sequentially, beginning with Rule 1.\n\nRule 1 - Definition of \"Victim\"\nThe Proposal:\nRule 1 should be amended to include the following definition of a victim:\n\n\"Victim\" means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the\nDistrict of Columbia. In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the\nlegal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons\nappointed as [*857] suitable by the court, may assume the crime victim's rights under these rules, but in no event shall the\ndefendant be named as such guardian or representative.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe CVRA directly defines \"victim\" using this language, !2° which ought to be folded into the rules for convenience. The\nrules currently define such terms as \"attorney for the government,\" \"federal judge,\" and \"petty offense.\" !*! \"Victim\" should\nlikewise be defined.\n\nA definition is required for a second reason: Rule 32 currently contains a differing definition of \"victim\" as \"an individual\nagainst whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence.\" !2? Because that definition varies\nfrom that mandated by the CVRA, it must be changed. Furthermore, the CVRA's definition comes with an interpretative\nhistory. '?? The CVRA's definition of \"victim\" is taken almost verbatim from the 1996 Mandatory Victims Restitution Act\n(MVRA). !?4 In tum, the MVRA drew on the 1982 Victim Witness Protection Act (VWPA). !?> As a result, the CVRA uses a\ndefinition of \"victim\" that is more than twenty-two years old and that has not produced major administrative or definitional\n\nproblems. Courts will be able to draw from that history to determine who qualifies as a \"victim.\" 17°\n\n20 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(e) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n\n21 See Fed. R. Crim. P. 1(b)(1), 1(b)(3), 1(b)(8).\n\n22 Td. at 32(a)(2).\n\n23 See generally Beloof, Cassell & Twist, supra note 15, at 49-69 (reviewing different definitions of \"victim\" for purposes of crime victims’\nlegislation).\n\n4 See 18 U.S.C. 3663A(a)(2). For differences from the old law, see Twist, supra note 2.\n\n25 See 18 U.S.C. 3663(a)(2).\n\n26 See, e.g., Hughey v. United States, 495 U.S. 411 (1990) (holding that VWPA limited \"victim\" to victims of the actual offense of\nconviction so that district court could not order restitution on basis of charges that were dropped as part of plea agreement); United States v.\nFollet, 269 F.3d 996 (9th Cir. 2001) (holding that a free clinic was not a \"victim\" of the defendant's rape of his niece); Moore v. United\nStates, 178 F.3d 994 (Sth Cir. 1999) (holding that a bank customer was \"victim\" of attempted bank robbery under MVRA where defendant\npointed a sawed-off shotgun at the customer and the teller, who were standing only two feet apart, while demanding money), cert. denied,\n528 U.S. 943 (1999); United States v. Sanga, 967 F.2d 1332 (9th Cir. 1992) (holding that foreign national who conspired to be brought into\nUnited States illegally was still a \"victim\" of the conspiracy where her smuggler threatened her life and forced her to work as live-in maid\nonce she had arrived); United States v. Bedonie, 317 F. Supp. 2d 1285 (D. Utah 2004) (holding that \"victim\" in manslaughter case under\nMVRA was murdered person himself and not the estate), rev'd on other grounds, United States v. Serawop, 410 F.3d 656 (10th Cir. 2005).\nSee generally John F. Wagner, Jr., Annotation, Who Is a \"Victim,\" So as To Be Entitled to Restitution Under Victim and Witness Protection\nAct, 108 A.L.R. Fed. 828 (2005).\n\nA few new issues will need to be litigated. For example, the Hughey case noted above conflicts with the views of Senator Jon Kyl, co-\nsponsor of the CVRA, who explained that the definition of \"victim\" in the CVRA is an intentionally broad definition because \"all victims of\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017727",
