We are continuing discussions with Jim and tomorrow we\nwill meet him face to face on skype. We will brief him on the situation here so that he will be able to advice\n\nus more effectively. Already he has sent some very useful suggestions and we are working on them.\n\nGetting the right people to head various aspects on the campaign is difficult here but we should be able to\npull the team together shortly.\n\nWe will need some more help from lan and Rory because we are still weak on international\ncommunication. Some old negative stuff keeps coming up in the Guardian newspaper in England. But most\nof the international media is not paying much attention to Maldives right now.\n\n| have asked Rory to help find a full time communications guy to stay here for about a year to work with\nme. He doesn't have to be an expert, just a good graduate student would do. Some really positive stuff is\nalso happening now and we need the world to know about them.\n\nWorld Energy Forum and CGI guys are here. | am meeting Clinton people in a few minutes.\n\n| have some funding now but will ask all friends to help raise more later when things start happening in full\nswing. Election is now scheduled to early September.\n\nHope all is well and look forward to seeing you here in the not too distant future.\nWarm regards,\nWaheed\n\nOn Jan 9, 2013, at 6:03 PM, Jeffrey Epstein wrote:\n\nhow is it shaping up? what are the biggest hurdles.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029531",
