The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I’ve just been. You will\nnever think the same way about anything again.”\n\nSo spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at\nthe moment as the alleged “procurer” of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nEpstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of\nanother investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations\nthat he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have\nzeroed in on Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his\nold pal.\n\nI wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that focused\non his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the\nchairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is\ncurrently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million.\n\nThe piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with\nwhom he had sexual relationships.

I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on\n\nthe intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And\ntheir stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030575",
