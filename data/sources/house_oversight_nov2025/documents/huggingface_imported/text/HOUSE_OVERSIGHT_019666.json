In it, he\nwould tell handpicked journalists that he had given all his docu-\nments to Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong and took none of\nthem to Russia. Wizner could then argue that documents such as the\nFISA court order were improperly classified secret and that disclos-\ning them served the public good. The government might not be able\nto contest his claim without further revealing NSA sources. Under\nthese circumstances, it might be induced to agree to a plea bargain\nfor Snowden. Changing the narrative would also help enhance his\npublic image as a whistle-blower.\n\nSnowden’s new narrative that he had destroyed all the documents\nhe had in his possession before coming to Moscow and had no access\nto any NSA documents, not even those that he had distributed to\njournalists, was reinforced in a series of interviews that Wizner\nhelped arrange. “I went the first six months without giving an inter-\nview,” Snowden later said. “It wasn’t until December 2013 that I\ngave my first interview to Barton Gellman.” (Snowden did not count\n\n® his Internet exchange with Risen in October as an “interview”.) ®\n\nIn late December 2013, Snowden met with Barton Gellman. It was\nhis first face-to-face meeting with a journalist since he had arrived in\nRussia in June. Snowden turned his laptop toward Gellman and, as\nif proving his point, said to him, “There’s nothing on it.... My hard\ndrive is completely blank.” That his computer had no files stored on\nit at that moment of course meant very little. Just six weeks earlier,\nSnowden had met with the former CIA officer Ray McGovern, who\nhad been invited to meet him in Moscow along with three other\nAmerican whistle-blowers. At that meeting, he told McGovern that\nhe had stored all the NSA data he had taken on external hard drives.\nGellman asked about the precise whereabouts of the files, but, as he\nreported, Snowden declined to answer that question. He would only\nsay that he was “confident he did not expose them to Chinese intel-\nligence in Hong Kong.” That answer did not nail down the issue,\nso Wizner arranged for Vanity Fair, which was preparing an article\non Snowden, to submit questions. In his reply to them, Snowden\nwrote that he destroyed all his files in Hong Kong because he didn’t\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 178 ® 9/30/16 11:09 AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019666",
