If a Mediterranean empire\nleaves the Levant unoccupied, it opens the door to the possibility of a\ngreat power originating to the east seizing the ports of the Levant and\nchallenging the Mediterranean power for maritime domination. In\nshort, control of the Levant binds a Mediterranean empire together\nwhile denying a challenger from the east the opportunity to enter the\nMediterranean. Holding the Levant, and controlling Israel, is a\nnecessary preventive measure for a Mediterranean empire.\n\nIsrael is also important to any empire originating to the east of Israel,\neither in the Tigris-Euphrates basin or in Persia. For either, security\ncould be assured only once it had an anchor on the Levant.\nMacedonian expansion under Alexander demonstrated that a power\ncontrolling Levantine and Turkish ports could support aggressive\noperations far to the east, to the Hindu Kush and beyond. While\nTurkish ports might have sufficed for offensive operations, simply\nsecuring the Bosporus still left the southern flank exposed. Therefore,\nby holding the Levant, an eastern power protected itself against\nattacks from Mediterranean powers.\n\nThe Levant was also important to any empire originating to the north\nor south of Israel. If Egypt decided to move beyond the Nile Basin\nand North Africa eastward, it would move first through the Sinai and\nthen northward along the coastal plain, securing sea lanes to Egypt.\nWhen Asia Minor powers such as the Ottoman Empire developed,\nthere was a natural tendency to move southward to control the eastern\nMediterranean. The Levant is the crossroads of continents, and Israel\nlies in the path of many imperial ambitions.\n\nIsrael therefore occupies what might be called the convergence zone\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031865",
