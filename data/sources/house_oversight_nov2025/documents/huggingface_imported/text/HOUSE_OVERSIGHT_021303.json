  "text": "The Mind and Body Are One\n\nThe Cartesian view of the mind\nas distinct from the body persists in\ntwenty-first century discourse as the\nmind-body problem alluded to by Gary\nBerntson. Berntson provides evidence\nthat the mind and the body, psychology\nand physiology, are not independent of\neach other but represent different levels\nof organization of human organisms.\nBeliefs influence thoughts, behaviors,\nand physiology, and peripheral\nphysiological processes signal central\nneural networks that influence\ncognitions and feelings crucial for the\ngeneration and moderation of beliefs.\nSpiritual beliefs are considered by some\nto be contentious candidates for\nscientific examination, yet Berntson\nargues that spiritual beliefs can be\nidentified, measured, and subjected to\nscientific investigation in the same\nfashion as any other belief or invisible\nforce. Accordingly, Berntson examines\nthe effects of a specific spiritual belief —\nthe belief that one has a close personal\nrelationship with God. As documented\nby Berntson, this belief is associated\nwith rather profound physiological and\nhealth effects.\n\nWhereas Berntson focuses on the\ninfluence of the mind on the body and\nvice versa, Giin Semin speaks of the\nmind in the body and, more specifically,\nin several bodies simultaneously. In his\nsocial cognition model, Semin\nchallenges the limits of individual social\ncognition and argues that regulation and\nco-regulation of social behavior are\ndistributed across brains. When several\nindividuals exhibit spontaneous\nsynchronized behaviors (e.g., hand-\nclapping), the human tendency is to\ninvoke a “supra-individual” explanation.\nSemin describes a mechanism by which\n\nPage |57\n\nthe supra-individual source can be\nexplained as shared motor\nrepresentations and ongoing monitoring\nof observed actions that, under certain\nconditions, lead to dissolution of the\nboundary between self and other. The\nresulting shared experience of unity and\ncollective identity may feel\ntranscendental, but the mechanisms are\nas real and explicable as those governing\nindividual behaviors and experiences.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021303",
