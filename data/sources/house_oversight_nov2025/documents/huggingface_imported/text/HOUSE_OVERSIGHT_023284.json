  "text": "Subject:\nTo: Melanie Spinella (i\nRadical but my preferred idea. . START from total scratch. there is absolutely nothing worth\nkeeping in your family office except for heather , nothing at all . I remember when 1 bought my first\nhouse in order to renovate and jack robertson said forget it. knock it down start again, I could n't\nbelieve it. but he was right. Like your tax returns that were done in triplicate. TOM RICH ALAN. .\ntom and rich were not really useful in the end. Alan was the only smart one. you should in my\nopinion Start a brand new office. hire cfo. bring joe over. heather and samantha, — run parallel\nfor 6 months and close down the mess of elysium forever. leave your kids a functioning operation\nprofessionally constructed and managed. NOT BY ME!!!\nLAst nov 1 laid out priorities IT , being the first nothing as of today. _in July I said focus on airplane\nas atest. to examine procedure and proficiency, so far mostly a waste of resources time people\netc. Only last week told debra owns 49 percent of plane. no IT to speak of. bens house\nunaccounted for. tax returns very very sloppy, . boat still argued as third home. . pilots bonuses? ,\nstructure unkown by all. cash sitlling at the same time loans outstanding.\nPhaidon , looks like close to breakeven in a few years. others totally unknown. Query , do you\nreally want this ? : Im not sure how you both want to have an investment office and have cash flow\nbeing eaten by publishing and loans amounts outstanding increased by art. --interest rates will be\ngoing up.-. your plane will cost 10 million to refinance - so will boat if sold next year-. art space and\nregan , both needs more cash. with little return, taxes , art purchases. Part of radical solutition is to\nsell publishing.altogether. (are the children really interested.) restrucuture plane from scratch.\nlayers unncessary. simplify crazy structure s bank accounts trading accounts accounts payble. credit\ncards. etc. The best way to wean yourself away from me is to have someone else do the whole thing\nfrom scratch. . move brad to be the replacement for Richard. . he is nice but this 1s not what he does.\nHim saying it is soooo fucked up to me , was only an echo of me sayint it to you.\n\nSubject:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella [as\n\nas brad can attest , I spent time today with joslin, joe. etc. no question at all, a failed experiment. In\nthe words of a banker that made a call on your office. what happened? leon seems to have replaced\nEillenn with a team of Shleppers. ? I know you care little for what they may think , but the legacy you\nleave your kids is just that. you only have 60 days of planning left for this year. numbers are all over the\nplace.\n\nI recieved a nice call from Karp today, . He touted me as a great friend to you. I am happy to be just\nthat.. He said it was important for me to tell you what others won't. Keep heather, fire EVERYONE\nelse.\n\nDate: Mon, Oct 26, 2015 at 1:10 PM\n\nSubject: CONSTRUCTIVE?\n\nTo: Brad Wechsler i, Melanie Spincla is\n\n1 cash flow projections for 16. . draft ok. i will be easy. ineed reught projection. 2. phaidon chart\nlaid out now with who signs in sale of shares vs enitities. ? ie managing memebrs. . 2. 3 new\ntrusts.
