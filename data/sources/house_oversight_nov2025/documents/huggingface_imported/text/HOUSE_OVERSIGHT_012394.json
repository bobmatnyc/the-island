  "text": "6) Lear Siegler, Inc., Energy Products Division v. Lehman, 842 F.2d 1102 (9th Cir. 1988), withdrawn\nin part 893 F.2d 205 (9th Cir. 1990) (en banc): The President refused to comply with provisions of the\nCompetition.in Contracting Act that he viewed as unconstitutional and thereby allowed for judicial\nresolution of the issue. The Ninth Circuit rejected the President's arguments about the constitutionality\nof the provisions. The court further determined that Lear Siegler was a prevailing party and was\nentitled to attorneys' fees, because the executive branch acted in bad faith in refusing to execute the\ncontested provisions. In this regard, the court stated that the President's action was “utterly at odds with\nthe texture and plain language of the Constitution,\" because a statute is part of the law of the land that\nthe President is obligated to execute. Id. at 1121, 1124. On rehearing en banc, the court ruled that Lear\nSiegler was not a prevailing party and withdrew the sections of the opinion quoted above.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012394",
