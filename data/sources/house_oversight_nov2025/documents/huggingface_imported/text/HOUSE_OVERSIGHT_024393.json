  "text": "@WolfyJam - 2 hours ago\n\nNotice how celebrities basking in their narcissism think they can dictate culture to us while they live their lives in the\ncomfort of their ivory castles. Mia farrow has no clue what the right to bear arms means and because of that she needs\nto shut the hell up. _As far as blacks go-- | grew up in the 70's coming home from Hallahan H.S. in Philadel phia, me and\nmy small group of girls were swarmed by a mob of black girls who would kick and slap and pull hair without provocation.\nof course we would fight back but then that was back in the day when whites weren't sissies. Still | made excuses for\nthem. Black men would get in my face for no other reason than to intimidate me. rocks were thrown a my car for no\nreason. So, in short, based on my experiences Blacks are the cause of racism and if they hate whites so much then they\nshould stay away completely and totally. _\n\nReport\n\nReply\n\n+1\n\n@WolfyJam - 2 hours ago\n\n| read the Control factor and it was excellent. | wish more people would realize that our country is at its most vulnerable\nthan ever in its history. the jihadis have basically taken over the inner cities. Islam's love for violence coupled with\nignorance and narcissim are a recipe for disaster. | hope Americans wake up in time to save their future. I'm not\noptimistic though. | think its over but still | fight on.\n\nReport\nReply\n\nPost a new comment\nTop of Form\n\nBottom of Form\n\nComment as a Guest, or login:\n\n° Login to IntenseDebate\n° Login to WordPress.com\ne Login to Twitter\ne\nTop of Form\nName\nEmail\n\nDisplayed next to your comments.\n\nNot displayed publicly.\nBottom of Form\nSubmit Comment\nSubscribe to\nFPM appreciates your comments that abide by the following guidelines:\n\n1.
