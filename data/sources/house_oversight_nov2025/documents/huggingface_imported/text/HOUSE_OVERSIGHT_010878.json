Is it or is it not your understanding that\nJudge Marra ruled that the allegations in this pleading\nin front of you were so irrelevant to the pleading in\nwhich they were stated, that they should be stricken\nfrom the public record?\n\nA. Inthat particular pleading at that\nparticular time, that’s right.\n\nQ. Does that cause you to reassess, in any way,\nhaving filed this document?\n\nA. Well, I think certainly as a tactical matter,\nwe should have reserved the -- the allegations for --\nfor another motion. I -- 1 think that's -- you know,\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n301\ncertainly, with the -- you're -- now, we are now sort of\nspeculating, would we have done something different if\nwe knew that? And the answer to that is, sure, we would\nhave tried to do something that Judge Marra thought was\nthe appropriate way to handle it, so...\n\nQ. And Judge Marra also reminded counsel of\ntheir Rule 11 obligations; didn't he?\n\nA, That's right. Yeah.\n\nQ. And did it cause you to question, not\ntactics, but whether you were acting properly in filing\nthis?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. I --\n\nMR. SIMPSON: I'm just asking if it caused\n\nhim to reassess.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: I understand what you're\nasking, and you're asking him about his mental\nprocesses in connection with pending litigation.\nThat's work product. I instruct you not to\nanswer that question.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. allright. You testified yesterday that one\n\nreason that you found the filing of the complaint on\nbehalf of Jane Doe 102, who is Virginia Roberts, by\nthe -- Bob Josefsberg and -- and why that was\nsignificant was that Bob Josefsberg had been selected by\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n03:13:41\n\n03:13:45\n\n03:13:48\n\n03:13:51\n\n03:13:54\n\n03:14:01\n\n03:14:03\n\nOn Oa” hb © bw\n\n03:14:04\n\n©\n\n03:14:05\n03:14:11 4 0\nosta1a 14\n03:14:20 1 2\n03:14:25 1 3\nost4a27 14\n03:14:30 1 5\n03:14:32 4 6\n03:14:35, 1 7\n03:14:37 1 8\n03:14:39 1 9\n03:14:43 20\n03:14:45 21\n03:14:45 22\n03:14:47 23\n03:14:49 24\n03:14:53 25\n\n03:14:55\n03:14:56\n03:15:00\n03:15:04\n03:15:07\n03:15:12\n\n03:15:17\n\nOn Oanhb WKH =a\n\n03:15:19\n\n©\n\n03:15:19\no3ts21 10\n031523 11\n03:15:26 12\n031527 13\no3is23 14\no3ts31 15\nosts33 16\nostsas 17\nostsas 18\nosts3s 19\no3x1542 20\noxtsa4 21\n031850 22\n03:15:52 23\n031585 24\noss 25\n\nPage 300 to 303 of 335\n\n302\nthe United States Attorney for the Southern District of\nFlorida to represent victims, correct?\n\nA. Yes. Through the -- through the NPA, yeah,\nthere was an apparatus that led to his selection.\n\nQ. And does that answer reflect holding the U.S.\nAttorney for the Southern District of Florida in that\noffice in high regard?\n\nA. Sure.\n\nQ. Do you contend that at the time the United\nStates Attorney for the Southern District of Florida\nnegotiated the NPA, they knew that Professor Dershowitz,\nhimself, had been involved in abuse of minors?\n\nA. Idon't know exactly what information they\nhad. I do know that we have been propounding discovery\nrequests on all of these subjects, including\nProfessor Dershowitz's involvement, when the U.S.\nAttorney knew. They are asserting privilege over that.\nI would wish they would waive the privilege or at least\nprovide the information to pro bono crime victims’\nattorneys that they have, so we can get to the bottom of\nthis.\n\nBut there have been, you know, a nonstop\nseries of assertions of privilege and other barriers\ninterposed against us in this case, and I think\ninappropriately so, and -- and we have been arguing that\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n303\nnow for a number of years.\n\nQ. Would you agree with me that if the United\nStates Attorney's Office had been aware that Professor\nDershowitz had engaged in sexual misconduct with minors,\nor himself had observed Mr. Epstein do so, that it would\n\nhave been improper and unethical for them to let Mr. --\n\nProfessor Dershowitz negotiate the terms of the NPA with\nthem?\n\nA. If they had direct personal knowledge of\nthat, sure. I mean, the -- the -- but the realities are\na little bit more complicated in that Professor\nDershowitz, over the last couple of days as\nfrequently -- has frequently used the word \"continuum,\"\nand so if they were certain of that, it absolutely would\nhave -- would have been unethical.\n\nThe question is: Well, what if they had a\nsuspicion or what if -- you know, a reasonable suspicion\nor a possible suspicion. Those are the kinds of\ndimensions that you've got to, you know, take into\naccount in the real world about, you know, what they --\nwhat they would have done.\n\nI mean, it seems pretty clear, for example,\nthat at some point, you know, later on, they got a black\nbook in which Professor Dershowitz's name had been\ncircled. Now, what they did with that information, I --\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n\n(954) 331-4400\n38 of 46 sheets\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010878",
