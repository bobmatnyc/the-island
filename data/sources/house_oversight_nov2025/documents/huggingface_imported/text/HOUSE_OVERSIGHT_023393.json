  "text": "In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)\n\nThe pleadings further allege that the relationship between these charities and al-Qaeda’s terrorism was widely known and\npublicly reported. Throughout the 1990s, numerous media reports and statements by government officials disclosed similar\nfacts, including the terrorist activities of al Haramain, TRO, and WAMY. JA 2596-97, 4337-38, 7891-94. For example, a\nmajor Egyptian newspaper, Rose Al Yusuf, reported in late 1992 “that the ITRO and the Bin Laden Organization in Egypt\nrecruited and *96 sponsored more than 700 Arab operatives to travel to Afghanistan to train as jihadist terrorists.” JA2596.\nInternational media reported “that the Cairo office of the IRO was managed by the bin Laden family and Mohamad Showki\nAl Istanbul, who was sentenced to death in Egypt for his Islamic extremist activities.” Jd. Another newspaper reported that\n“Tt]he ITRO was shut down by Egyptian authorities later in 1993 or early 1994 as a result of the charity’s links to Osama Bin\nLaden.” Jd. An article in Rose Al Yusuf provided:\n\nWorking with Palestinian Islamist Shaykh Abdallah Azzam, Bin-Ladin set up the ‘Jihad and Relief”\nguesthouse in Peshawar to recetve volunteers who would arrive after a short stop in the al-Ansar\nguesthouse in Jeddah. The route of this process passed through the unlicensed Cairo office of the [MWL],\ndirected by Dr. Abdallah Umar Nasif.\n\nJA2596-97. In addition, public testimony from a high-level al-Qaeda operative prior to September 11, 2001, “described how\nOsama Bin Laden’s brother-in-law, convicted terrorist and IIRO employee, Jamal Khalifa, opened a [MWL] office in\nPakistan for the use of the founders of al Qaeda to recruit, train and equip al Qaeda terrorists.” JA2597.\n\nMoreover, it is entirely reasonable to conclude that the defendants were aware of these facts based on their obligation under\nthe Koran to *97 inquire into the source of their zakat and haram donations, many of which went to al-Qaeda front charities.\nSee supra 47-48, 50-51, 81-82, 85, 89-90, 96; JA1070-71. That is, “[t]he Quran requires every Muslim, individuals and\ncorporations, to give Zakat for specific charitable purposes identified in the Quaran.” JA1062. Muslims are also required to\ndonate their haram income, which is money derived from sources such as earned interest or “impure activities such as\ngambling or the sale of liquor.” JA1063-64. To ensure that their zakat and haram contributions “satisfy their religious\nobligations under Islam,” entities making the contributions are “required to determine that the ultimate recipients ... fall\nwithin one of the categories prescribed in the Quran ....” JA1070.\n\nIt is commonplace for courts to infer a defendant’s mental state from surrounding facts when analyzing a Rule 12(b)(6)\nmotion to dismiss. See, e.g., In re Chiquita Brands Int’l, Inc., 690 F. Supp. 2d 1296, 1310 (S.D. Fla. 2010) (“ ‘knowledge\nmay be inferred from circumstantial evidence’ ”) (quoting Schneberger v. Wheeler, 859 F.2d 1477, 1480 (11th Cir. 1988));\nFoster v. Auburn Univ., No. 11-CV-503, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141056, at *11-12 (M.D. Ala. Dec. 8, 2011) (finding that\nfactual allegations gave rise to reasonable inference that defendant engaged in intentional conduct); Med- *98 Sys. v.\nMasterson Mktg., No. 11-CV-695, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135216, at *19-20 (S.D. Cal. Nov. 23, 2011) (same); U.S. Bank\nNat'l Ass’n v. Verizon Commce’ns, Inc., No. 10-CV-1842, 2011 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 106657, at *12-16 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 19,\n2011) (same); Redding v. Edwards, 569 F. Supp. 2d 129, 132 (D.D.C. 2008) (same); Almog v. Arab Bank, PLC, 471 F. Supp.\n2d 257, 291 (E.D.N.Y. 2007) (same). Even in the context of criminal prosecutions under Sections 2339A and 2339B, courts\nhave held it proper to infer a defendant’s mental state based on circumstantial evidence. See, e.g., United States v. El-Mezain,\nNo. 09-1560, 2011 U.S. App. LEXIS 24216 (5th Cir. Dec. 7, 2011) (finding that “it was logical for the jury to conclude that\nthe defendants’ inten[ded] ... to support Hamas” as “the evidence strongly supported the inference that the defendants were\nconnected to Hamas”); United States v. Augustin, 661 F.3d 1105, 1121 n.7 (11th Cir. 2011) (finding that “there is ample\ncircumstantial evidence of [the defendant’s] knowledge of Al Qaeda and its terrorist activities”); United States v. Kassir, No.\n09-CR-356, 2009 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 83075, at *21-22 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 11, 2009) (finding that evidence “allowed the jury to\ninfer that [the defendant] intended the jihad training to benefit al Qaeda”).\n\n*99 An inference that the defendants possessed the requisite mental state is particularly reasonable where, as here, the\nplaintiffs allege that the charities supported by the defendants were publicly known to have been involved in terrorist\nactivities and to be affiliated with al-Qaeda. See Wyatt, 785 F. Supp. 2d at 647-48; see also Goldberg v. UBS AG, 660 F.\nSupp. 2d 410, 428-29 (E.D.N.Y. 2009) (finding that plaintiffs had “sufficiently pled that the defendant consciously\ndisregarded the fact that it was supporting a terrorist organization” when various forms of public information suggested “that\n\nWESTLAW\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023393",
