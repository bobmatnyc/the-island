  "text": "the electorate. It does not reside with either of the two major political\nparties. It is not represented by the press. It is not arbitrated by a judiciary\nthat protects us from predators. Power rests with corporations. And\ncorporations gain very lucrative profits from war, even wars we have no\nchance of winning. All polite appeals to the formal systems of power will\nnot end the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We must physically obstruct the\nwar machine or accept a role as its accomplice.”\n\nWhen it comes to bloodbaths, the only difference between such\ninvisible corporations and Jared Loughner is that he did it face-to-face.\n\nObviously, Loughner is crazy, but not legally insane, because he\nknew right from wrong, as indicated by his expectation of life in prison or\nexecution for his unspeakable crime. True, John Hinckley was crazy when\nhe tried to assassinate Ronald Reagan—his motivation was to impress\nactress Jodie Foster so she would go out bowling with him--yet he was\nsentenced to serve //s time in a mental hospital, including occasional\noutings with his parents, which resulted in public outrage and a weakening\nof the insanity defense.\n\nIronically, Hinckley came out for gun control, and Reagan came out\n\nagainst it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015334",
