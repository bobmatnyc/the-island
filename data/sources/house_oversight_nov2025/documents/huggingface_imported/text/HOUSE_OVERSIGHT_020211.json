Even though she had been living on and\noff with Snowden during the past two years abroad, including while he worked at the CIA in\nSwitzerland and the NSA in Japan, they had not shared a home in America up until now. The\nnow 25-year old Mills posted on Instagram “Finally in our first US place together.” She also put\non line pictures of him in bed with her, who she now affectionately referred to in her posts as a\n“computer crusader.”\n\nDell meanwhile had him to work on problem- solving for its corporate clients. In preparation\nfor his corporate role, he shaved off this facial hair and, with Lindsay’s help, bought a Ralph\nLauren suit. These corporate clients were assisting the NSA, the CIA, and the Defense\nIntelligence Agency (DIA). Consequently, Snowden dealt with a wide range of intelligence\nofficers, and gave presentations on the vulnerabilities at computer security at the DIA-sponsored\nJoint Counter Intelligence seminar.\n\nHis dealings with these US intelligence officers in no way mitigated his resentment of the\nintelligence establishment. What began at the CIA in 2009 as objections to what he saw as the\nincompetence of his superiors grew into well-articulated disapproval of the way that the US\ngovernment conducted its intelligence. He found NSA surveillance particularly worrisome, later\ntelling the Guardian: \"They [the NSA] are intent on making every conversation and every form of\nbehavior in the world known to them.\" He claimed after defecting to Moscow that he had voiced\nhis concerns about what he considered illicit surveillance to ten NSA officials, “none of whom\ntook any action to address them.” The NSA can find no record of these complaints but if\nSnowden had indeed complained to these officials while working for Dell, his superiors at Dell\neither didn’t notice or care that they had a very disgruntled employee on their hand. He also\nmade no secret of anger at the US government and the corporations that served it on the Internet.\nHe railed on the Ars Technica site against the complicity of private corporations, such as Dell,\nthat assisted the NSA. In his on-line posts in 2010, Snowden expressed loathing for the\nassistance that corporate America was providing the intelligence community. “It really concerns\nme how little this sort of corporate behavior bothers those outside of technology circles,” he\nwrote under his True Hoo-ha alias. He said he feared that America was already on “a slippery\nslope,” and suggested, perhaps adumbrating his own later actions, that this corporate assistance to\nUS intelligence “was entirely within our control to stop.” What the “computer crusader,” as Mills\nhad playfully called him in her Internet postings, expressed in these angry Internet postings was an\nalmost obsessive concern over individuals freely submitting to government authority. “Society\nreally seems to have developed an unquestioning obedience towards spooky types,” he wrote on\nArs Technica without mentioning that he himself worked for a corporation, Dell that assisted spy\nagencies. He asked rhetorically on this public forum whether the sinister slide towards a\nsurveillance state “sneaked in undetected because of pervasive government secrecy?”\n\nThe outright contempt he expressed towards this “government secrecy” in no way prevented\nhim from seeking even more secret work at Dell for the intelligence services.
