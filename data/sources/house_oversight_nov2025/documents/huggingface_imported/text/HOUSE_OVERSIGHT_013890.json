  "text": "Just set it and forget it!\n\n—RON POPEIL, founder of RONCO; responsible for more than $1 billion in sales of rotisserie\nchicken roasters\n\nAs to methods there may be a million and then some, but principles are few. The man who\ngrasps principles can successfully select his own methods. The man who tries methods,\nignoring principles, is sure to have trouble.\n\n— RALPH WALDO EMERSON\n\nThe Renaissance Minimalist\n\nDaeccie Price was waking up to another beautiful summer morning in his Brooklyn brownstone. First\n\nthings first: coffee. The jet lag was minor, considering he had just returned from a two-week jaunt\nthrough the islands of Croatia. It was just one of six countries he had visited in the last 12 months. Japan\nwas next on the agenda.\n\nBuzzing with a smile and his coffee mug in hand, he ambled over to his Mac to check on personal e-\nmail first. There were 32 messages and all brought good news.\n\nOne of his friends and business partners, also a cofounder of Limewire, had an update: Last Bamboo,\ntheir start-up poised to reinvent peer-to-peer technology, was rounding the final corners of development.\nIt could be their billion-dollar baby, but Doug was letting the engineers run wild first.\n\nSamson Projects, one of the hottest contemporary art galleries in Boston, had compliments for Doug’s\nlatest work and requests for expanded involvement with new exhibits as their sound curator.\n\nThe last e-mail in his inbox was a fan letter addressed to “Demon Doc” and praise for his latest\ninstrumental hip-hop album, onliness Vi.01. Doug had released his album as what he termed “open\nsource music” —anyone could download the album for free and use sounds from any track in his or her\nown compositions.\n\nHe smiled again, polished off his dark roast, and opened a window to deal with business e-mail next.\nIt would take much less time. In fact, less than 30 minutes for the day and 2 hours for the week.\n\nHow much things change.\n\nTwo years earlier, in June of 2004, I was in Doug’s apartment checking e-mail for what I hoped would\nbe the last time for a long time. I was headed to JFK Airport in New York in a matter of hours and was\npreparing for an indefinite quest around the world. Doug looked on with amusement. He had similar\nplans for himself and was finally extricating himself from a venture-funded Internet startup that had once\nbeen a cover story and his passion but was now just a job. The euphoria of the dot-com era was long\ndead, along with most chances for a sale or an IPO.\n\nHe bid me farewell and made a decision as the taxi pulled from the curb—enough of the complicated\nstuff. It was time to return to basics.\n\nProsoundeffects.com, launched in January of 2005 after one week of sales testing on eBay, was\ndesigned to do one thing: give Doug lots of cash with minimal time investment.\n\nThis brings us back to his business inbox in 2006.\n\nThere are 10 orders for sound libraries, CDs that film producers, musicians, video game designers, and\nother audio professionals use to add hard-to-find sounds—whether the purr of a lemur or an exotic\ninstrument—to their own creations. These are Doug’s products, but he doesn’t own them, as that would\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013890",
