The City produces a safe drinking water of\nhigh quality based on the test results over the last several years. According to the USEPA and\nthe FDEP established standards, the City’s drinking water supply is of good quality and can be\nconsumed directly without concern. For those who want an added measure of protection,\nsubstituting bottled drinking water is an option or under the kitchen counter reverse osmosis\n(RO) filtration system can be installed as added intermediary treatment to provide an excellent\nsource of high quality of drinking water. These RO units are not cost prohibitive, can be easily\ninstalled, and can usually supply sufficient drinking water for a typical household. A separate\ntap is usually installed near the standard sink faucet so the RO water is delivered on demand.\nThere are several local reputable vendors that can provide free quotation for installing under\nthe kitchen counter RO units. Please note that the typical RO unit we are referring to does not\ntreat the entire household water supply but rather just the water intended for drinking or\ncooking purposes.\n\nTo add a layer of confidence to residents’ concerns about the quality of the City’s drinking\nwater, we also recommend that the Town establish a primary point of contact for the City for\ncourtesy notification and/or discussion of real time details related to issues with the City’s\ntreatment and distribution processes. This could potentially avoid dramatized response to\ntypically less-detailed public notification.\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nResidents of Palm Beach receive potable water from the City of West Palm Beach (City)\nthrough a franchise agreement Town of Palm Beach (Town). As required under rule 62-550,\nFlorida Administrative Code, to protect the public health and ensure the quality of the delivered\npotable water product, these taps are routinely sampled by the City of West Palm Beach’s\nPublic Utilities Department for specified monitoring parameters. Concerned about assuring the\nquality of the potable water product delivered to Town residents by the City, the Town\nauthorized HSA Engineers & Scientists (HSA) to conduct a one-time sampling event from two\nof the sampling taps on the potable water distribution system (piping) serving the Town.\nCollected samples were targeted for laboratory analyses for regulated water chemistry\nparameters, constituents, and microbiologics most likely to be present in South Florida drinking\nwater supplies.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016682",
