Data: 2-Jan-08 to 16-Jun-17\n\n- Attractive risk-reward profile at current pricing: As highlighted in Exhibit 1,\nhistorically the trade held to expiry, at current pricing, would have generated an\naverage P&L of 8.4% when positive and -1.8% when negative. The risk-reward\nlooks even more attractive in extreme market outcomes as the max P&L of the\ntrade which is greater than 75% compares to the max loss of only 5.7%. The trade\nalso provides an effective way to gain long exposure to EU equities with limited\nrisks, as evident from the call-like payoff in Exhibit 1 (vs the ESTX50). It is worth\nnoting that, by construction, the maximum loss of the trade is 6.8% with the most\nlikely loss limited to the upfront premium of 1.8%. We also note that the trade\npayoff profile is superior to a SX5E Dec17 ATM call when sized such that: (i) the call\npremium is the same as the upfront premium for the dispersion trade (=1.8%, blue\n\nline), as well as (ii) when the call premium is the same as the theoretical maximum\nloss for the trade (=6.8%, orange line).\n\nExhibit 1: Hypothetical back-test of long Dec17 105% call on a basket of SAN, BNP, ING, ISP & DBK, short Dec17 ATM worst-of call on the same basket\n(upfront premium = 1.8%)\n\n80% ESTX50 6M returns Trade P&L (long basket call, short worst-of} 80% P&L\nQ,\n5 Avg P&L when positive: 8.4% 70%\n60% Avg P&L when negative: -1.8% 60%\n9g,\n40% 50%\n40%\n20% 30%\n20%\n0%\n10%\n20% ty 0%\nH “10% | SyS5E 4.7x Dect7 ~ATM call\n40% rt .
