  "text": "Did Snowden Act Alone? | 153\n\nThe Witting Accomplice Possibility\n\nThe witting accomplice scenario better fits with the principle in logic\ncalled Occam’s razor, which suggests that when one is choosing\nbetween alternative explanations, the one that requires the fewest\nassumptions should be given priority. It would be relatively easy\nto gain access to passwords if Snowden had the cooperation of an\ninsider at the center who had been read into the compartments or,\neven better, if he had the cooperation of a system administrator with\nthe necessary PKI cards and shell keys to bypass the password pro-\ntection. Such an accomplice could also help explain how Snowden\nwas able to get the job at the center in the first place, how he knew\nin advance that he could find there the “lists” of the NSA sources in\nforeign countries, and how he knew that there were security traps at\nthe center. Such a witting accomplice might even have prepared in\nadvance the “spiders” that Snowden used to index the files.\n\nThe witting accomplice scenario of course requires an unsettling\nexpansion of the plot. It means Snowden collaborated with one or\n\n© more insiders at the center to steal secret documents. It is not dif- ©\nficult to imagine, in light of the lax background checks for outside\ncontractors servicing the NSA, that there were others in the “geek\nsquad” who shared Snowden’s antipathy to NSA surveillance. Cer-\ntainly, we know that Snowden found other NSA workers who were\nwilling to attend his anti-surveillance CryptoParty in December\n2012. Some might be willing to offer Snowden help if he was willing\nto go public. Indeed, if the geek culture produced one Snowden, why\nwouldn’t it produce others? If such an accomplice lacked Snowden’s\nwillingness to flee to another country, he might have limited his par-\nticipation to supplying technical assistance. For his part, Snowden\nmight have agreed to divert suspicion from his accomplice by taking\nsole responsibility for the crime when he went public.\n\nAll of this is theoretically possible, but no witting accomplice was\never identified. The FBI, which was in charge of the domestic part of\nthe investigation of the Snowden case, questioned all of Snowden’s\nco-workers at the center over the course of six months and failed\nto find anyone who knowingly helped Snowden. If the accomplice\nwas an idealistic amateur, it is likely the FBI would have found him.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 153 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019641",
