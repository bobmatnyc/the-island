  "text": "aptitude for focusing on the minute details of a problem, yet never losing sight\nof the /arger picture, the wider issues. From my experience as commander of\nthe sayeret and during the 1973 war, and from watching other officers whom I\nrespected, it struck me that this was an essential part of effective leadership.\n\nBy “leadership”, at that stage in my life, I did not mean political leadership. I\nwas thinking in terms of the army. But I’d now finished my masters degree, and\nit was impossible to be unaware of the political context in which I’d be\nreturning to uniform. Since Camp David, our negotiators and the Egyptians had\nbeen trying to thrash out a formal deal. Sadat was being denounced as a traitor\nin the Arab world. Begin was seen by most in the outside world, and many\nIsraelis, as dragging his feet on the negotiations and risking the chance for peace\naltogether. If we did manabge to sign a peace treaty, however, we would be\nwithdrawing for the first time from land captured in 1967. That would mean\nfinding a new approach to security in the south, as well as a new focus on the\nmajority of our Arab neighbors who were railing against Sadat and seemed less\ninterested than ever in making peace.\n\nIn some ways, it was hard to leave our mini-kibbutz in Palo Alto. Michal,\nnow nearly nine, had thrived, quickly learning English and ending up with a\nperfectly American accent which has never left her. Yael has less vivid\nmemories of our time there. But we’d had the nearest thing to a normal family\nlife since our first, war-truncated, time at Stanford. During the university\nholidays, we’d also travelled: to Canada. Mexico. Lake Tahoe. Even Las Vegas,\nwhere, thankfully, we lacked the money to chance our luck, but where my years\nin the sayeret suddenly came in handy. We spent the day at Circus Circus, a\njoint casino-and-theme park tailored for families with kids. At a shooting\ngallery in the amusement area, I had no trouble landing dead-center hits on a\npassing procession of metal geese, to the consternation of the guy behind the\ncounter but the delight of my two young daughters. In probably the single\ngreatest moment of parental accomplishment I’d experienced since their birth, I\nbagged a huge fluffy teddy bear for each of them.\n\nI returned to Israel not just with the hope, but a reasonable expectation, that I\nwould get command of one of Israel’s two regular armored divisions: the 252,\nwhich was responsible for defending the south and, at least for now, was based\n\n187\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028035",
