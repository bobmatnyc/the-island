Is there something for central tendency that is like an inertial reference frame, from which a different abstract
understanding of probability develops, one that's better for showing the kloodgey, apparent force nature to
which you point?

yes ,now assume that there i a balancing force. and gravity is merely the result of paticles being pushed
together . etc

probablity and statistics gets its strengh from the law of large numbers ._ centrifigal force is a pseudo
force but not distinguishable in the right frame. . like gravity. lets assume that there is a force pushing
heads and tails towards a 50 50 distribution. . not merely recording it. regression to the
mean. etc. would . could be a force similar to the EM one.

Cool. And the former question, of clarification?

Watson's pretty wild and fun, if overconfident about some ideas about autism when I saw him talk ~4
years ago on book tour @Google. I met him once through Gunther Stent, as well as Crick on another

1. is probability a force rather than a markter. if you look ata bell curve from scratch, it looks as if
it under a force pushing things towards the center. i think gravity might be just that. 2. all signals
