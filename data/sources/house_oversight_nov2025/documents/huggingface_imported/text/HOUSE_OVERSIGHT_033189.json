Dennis <j\n\nDate: Wed, Nov 9, 2016 at 10:14 AM\nSubject: Responding to yesterday's election\nTo:\n\nDear Packer Families,\n\nLike many of you, I am writing this message on very little sleep. Last night was like no other in our\npolitical memory, defying the predictions of the most erudite pundits and political\nprognosticators.\n\nToday, we are spending a great deal of time unpacking the election results with our students\nacross the three divisions — during morning meeting and throughout the day in Lower School\nclassrooms, in Middle School advisories, during Upper School Community time, as well as in\nmany individual classroom conversations. I write to assure you that we will do our best to handle\nthese discussions with balance, sensitivity, and fairness.\n\nGiven that last week's mock election among Packer’s Upper School students showed that over\n80% favored Secretary Clinton, I don’t think it’s a huge leap to assume that there was more\ndisappointment than joy in Packer households as results unfolded last night. At the same time,\nthere are certainly Packer families who support Mr. Trump and are pleased with this outcome. As\na school community, we have an obligation to recognize that there will be a broad array of feelings\ngenerated by the election results, and it is our responsibility as a school to make space for these\nfeelings to be expressed thoughtfully and compassionately, as well as to model the tolerance and\nacceptance of difference that are among our core values. No doubt, we have our work cut out for\nus, but Iam confident in the good that we can do as a community.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033189",
