The cognitive leap is that in the latter case the relationship actually exists in the\nteacher’s implicitly hypothesized mind, rather than in CogPrime’s mind. No explicit hypothesis\nor model of the teacher’s mind need be created in order to form this implication-the hypothesis\nis created implicitly via inferential abstraction. Yet, a collection of implications of this nature\nmay be used via an uncertain reasoning system like PLN to create theories and simulations\nsuitable to guide complex inferences about other minds.\n\nFrom the perspective of developmental stages, the key point here is that in a CogPrime\ncontext this sort of inference is too complex to be viably carried out via simple inference\nheuristics. This particular example must be done via forward chaining, since the big leap is to\nactually think of forming the implication that concludes inference. But there are simply too\nmany combinations of relationships involving CogPrime’s eye, body, and so forth for the PLN\ncomponent to viably explore all of them via standard forward-chaining heuristics. Experience-\nguided heuristics are needed, such as the heuristic that if physical objects A and B are generally\nphysically and functionally similar, and there is a relationship involving some part of A and\nsome physical object R, it may be useful to look for similar relationships involving an analogous\npart of B and objects similar to R. This kind of heuristic may be learned by experience—and the\nmasterful deployment of such heuristics to guide inference is what we hypothesize to characterize\nthe concrete stage of development. The “concreteness” comes from the fact that inference control\nis guided by analogies to prior similar situations.\n\n11.4.3 The Formal Stage\n\nIn the formal stage, as shown in Figure 11.7, an agent should be able to carry out arbitrarily\ncomplex inferences (constrained only by computational resources, rather than by fundamental\nrestrictions on logical language or form) via including inference control as an explicit subject of\nabstract learning. Abstraction and inference about both the sensorimotor surround (world) and\nabout abstract ideals themselves (including the final stages of indirect learning about inference\nitself) are fully developed.\n\nFormal stage evaluation tasks are centered entirely around abstraction and higher-order\ninference tasks such as:\n\n1. Mathematics and other formalizations.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013116",
