  "text": "Person A: Hey, want to come over tonight?\n\nPerson B: You know, I'd love to, but I'm so exhausted from work, I really need to get\nsome sleep.\n\nor\nPerson A: Hey, want to come over tonight?\nPerson B: No.\n\nPeople of all genders really don't like saying \"no\" to things directly. Grasping this\nimportant cultural concept is one step on the path of learning how to communicate\neffectively about consent. But in my book, it's really not as important to understand why\npeople hate saying \"no\" directly, as it is to understand that people hate saying \"no\"\ndirectly. It's necessary to understand that because it means that pushing someone until\nthey say \"no\" can mean pushing them further than they wanted to go.\n\nI believe that the most important role of social criticism -- including sex-positive\nfeminism -- is not to tell people what to do. If you have sex that appears to be in line with\nridiculous and oppressive stereotypes, I really do not care as long as everyone involved is\nconsenting and having fun. I reserve the right to occasionally have consensual sex where\na gentleman friend beats me up before fucking me, and I reserve the right to enjoy it.\n\nBut I want to offer sex-positive feminist analyses in order to help people understand\nthemselves and their desires... and also understand their partners and their desires. I think\nthat many people have sex they don't like, sex that's in line with ridiculous and oppressive\nstereotypes, because they haven't been exposed to anything they like better. I think many\npeople have sex they don't like because they don't feel like they can look for something\ndifferent -- they think it's the best they can get. I think many people have sex they don't\nlike because they think it's what their partner wants -- and I think those people are\nfrequently wrong, and I think most partners would genuinely prefer that everyone be\nhaving fun.\n\nWhich is why I try to deconstruct sexual norms and stereotypes. Which is why I\nencourage people to look for what they like. Which is why I always emphasize talking\nabout it.\n\n8) Awesome, respectful, joyful, mutual sex means approaching sex as collaborative\nrather than adversarial. Aside from solo sex (i.e. masturbation), sex always involves\nanother person. And at its best, it's about having a good time with other people --\nunderstanding their reality, accepting it, playing with it. The best metaphors I've ever\nheard for sex were all about collaborative art, like a musical jam performance. Here's a\nbit from Thomas MacAulay Millar's totally brilliant essay \"Towards a Performance\nModel of Sex\" (please do read the whole thing someday):\n\nThe negotiation is the creative process of building something from a set of available\nelements. Musicians have to choose, explicitly or implicitly, what they are going to play:\ngenre, song, key and interpretation. The palette available to them is their entire skill set\n-- all the instruments they have and know how to play, their entire repertoire, their\nimagination and their skills -- and the product will depend on the pieces each individual\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018485",
