  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nwas privileged to have participated in many of the most intriguing and important cases and\ncontroversies of our era.\n\nThe law has changed considerably over the past half century. I have not only observed and\nwritten about these changes, I have helped to bring some of them about through my litigation, my\nwriting and my teaching. This book presents an account of these changes and of my participation\nin the cases that precipitated them. It is also an account of one man’s intellectual and ideological\ndevelopment during a dramatic century of world, American, and Jewish history, enriched with\nanecdotes and behind-the-scenes stories from my life and the lives of those I have encountered.\n\nAn autobiographer is like a defendant who takes the stand at his own trial. We all have the right\nto remain silent, both in life and in law. But if one elects to bear witness about his own life, then\nhe or she must tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. This commitment to\ncomplete candor is subject only to limited privileges such as those between a lawyer and a client,\nor a husband and a wife. A witness may be questioned not only about his actions, but also about\nhis motivations, his feelings, his biases, and his regrets. In this autobiography, I intend to comply\nwith these rules to the best of my ability.\n\nWhy then have I waived my privilege of silence and decided to write this autobiography: because\nI have lived the passion of my times and participated in some of the most transforming, legal and\npolitical events of the past half century. In this autobiography, I will describe and explain my role\nin litigating cases and advocating causes that have changed the political and legal landscape—for\nbetter or worse. I will also explain how I litigate difficult cases—the tactics and strategies I have\nsuccessfully developed over the years. My oath of honesty makes it impossible to hide behind the\nfalse modesty that often denies the readers of autobiographies an accurate picture of the impact an\nauthor has had on events.\n\nSince you’re reading these words, you’ve probably encountered the public Alan\nDershowitz—confrontational, unapologetic, brash, tough, argumentative, and uncompromising.\nThose who know me well—family, friends, and colleagues—hardly recognize the “character” I\nplay on TV [alternative: my TV persona]. They tell me in my personal life, I shy away from\nconfrontation and am something of a pushover. My son Elon says that when people bring me up\nin conversation, he can instantly tell whether they know me from TV or from personal\ninteractions—whether they know what he calls “The Dersh Character” or “the real Alan.”\n\nThis sharp dichotomy between my public and private personas was brought home to me quite\ndramatically, when a major motion picture, Reversal of Fortune, was made about my role in the\nClaus Von Bulow case, and a character, based on me, was played by Tony Award actor Ron\nSilver. The New York Times asked me to write an article for the arts and entertainment section\non how it feels to watch someone play you on the big screen.\n\nThe opening scene of the film had my character playing an energetic basketball game with\nhimself—true enough. But when he’s interrupted by a phone call giving him the news that he had\nlost a case involving two brothers on death row (the Tison brothers, see Chapter 12), he smashes\nthe phone on the pavement.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017092",
