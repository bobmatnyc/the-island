  "text": "certain factors beyond the control of the portfolio company and the General Partner. The\neconomic environment for all companies, and in particular for healthcare technology and start-\nup companies, may remain challenging. Business risks may be more significant in portfolio\ncompanies embarking on a build-up or operating turnaround strategy and in smaller or\ndevelopment stage portfolio companies. All portfolio companies may face intense competition,\nchanging business and economic conditions, risks of technological acceptance and obsolescence\nor other developments that may adversely affect their performance.\n\nIlliquidity of Portfolio Investments\n\nInvestments by the Fund generally will be illiquid securities acquired through privately\nnegotiated transactions. The Fund may be unable to realize its investment objectives by sale or\nother disposition at attractive prices or will otherwise be unable to complete an exit strategy.\nExternal factors beyond the General Partner’s control, such as overall economic conditions, the\ncompetitive environment and the availability of potential acquirors of the Fund’s interests in\nportfolio companies may shorten or lengthen the Fund’s holding period in such portfolio\ncompanies. In some cases, the Fund may be prohibited by contract from selling such securities\nfor a period of time or otherwise may be restricted from the disposition of such securities.\n\nLack of Operating History\n\nThe Fund and the General Partner are newly formed entities, and, accordingly have no\noperating history or investments upon which investors can evaluate the potential performance\nof the Fund. The prior performance of the Fund Managers or their investments as described in\nthis Memorandum is not necessarily indicative of the Fund’s future results. There can be no\nassurance that investments by the Fund will achieve returns comparable to the historical\nperformance reflected in this Memorandum, and in any event, the returns achieved by the Fund\nwill be subject to the Management Fee and the General Partner’s carried interest. Any given\ninvestment made by the Fund may prove to be worthless, and there is a risk that investors\ncould lose money.\n\nNo Assurance of Profit or Distributions\n\nThe Fund’s task of identifying opportunities in private and public operating companies,\nmanaging such investments and realizing a significant return for investors is difficult. Many\norganizations operated by persons of competence and integrity have been unable to make,\nmanage and realize such investments successfully. There is no assurance that the investments\nof the Fund will be profitable or that any distribution will be made to the Limited Partners.\nAny return on investment to the Limited Partners will depend upon successful investments\nbeing made by the Fund. The marketability and value of any such investment will depend\nupon many factors beyond the control of the Fund. The Fund may not have sufficient cash\navailable to make tax distributions to the Partners. The expenses of the Fund may exceed its\nincome, and the Limited Partners could lose the entire amount of their contributed capital.\nAccordingly, prospective investors should not subscribe to the Fund unless they can readily\nbear the consequences of such a loss.\n\nCompetition\n\nThe business of identifying, structuring and implementing venture capital investments, along\nwith other investments within the strategy of NLV-III is highly competitive. The Fund will be\ncompeting for investments against other groups, including institutional investors, investment\nmanagers and industrial groups owned by large and well-capitalized investors.
