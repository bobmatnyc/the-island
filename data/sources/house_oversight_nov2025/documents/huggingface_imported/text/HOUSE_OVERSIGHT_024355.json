On November 3, 2017, we amended this\nagreement to increase the aggregate amount of principal balances of finance receivables we can sell to $1.5 billion. We amended the agreement again on\nNovember 2, 2018 to, among other things and subject to the terms of the agreement, increase the purchase commitment to up to a maximum of $1.25 billion\nof additional principal balances of finance receivables during the remaining term of the agreement.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold approximately $733.4 million in principal balances of finance receivables under the\npurchase and sale agreement. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $1.1 billion of unused capacity under this agreement. The agreement was\nmost recently amended on January 4, 2019.\n\nThe financing partners have engaged DriveTime as servicer of the receivables purchased under this agreement. DriveTime had aggregate\nearnings of $3.1 million pursuant to the agreement for performing servicing functions for the year ended December 31, 2018.\n\nMASTER TRANSFER AGREEMENTS\n\nIn December 2016, we entered into a master transfer agreement pursuant to which we sell finance receivables meeting certain underwriting\ncriteria to certain financing partners (the “2016 Master Transfer Agreement’). Under the agreement, the purchaser trust agreed to purchase up to an\naggregate of $292.2 million in principal balances of finance receivables. In November 2017, we terminated the remaining capacity under the 2016 Master\nTransfer Agreement and replaced this facility by entering into a new master transfer agreement pursuant to which we sell finance receivables meeting\ncertain underwriting criteria to certain financing partners (the “2017 Master Transfer Agreement”). Under the agreement, the purchaser trust agreed to\npurchase up to an aggregate of $357.1 million in principal balances of finance receivables.\n\nOn November 2, 2018, we amended the 2017 Master Transfer Agreement to, among other things and subject to the terms of the agreement,\nincrease and extend the trust’s commitment to purchase finance receivables from us. The trust’s currently available financing following the amendment\npermits up to $454.5 million in principal balances of finance receivables to be purchased, and the 2017 Master Transfer Agreement’s purchase commitment\ncontemplates the trust securing up to three times the currently available financing in the aggregate.\n\nDuring the year ended December 31, 2018, we sold approximately $348.8 million in principal balances of finance receivables under the 2017\nMaster Transfer Agreement prior to the amendment in November, excluding those that were part of the refinancing transactions described below under\n“Refinancing Transfer Agreements”. As of December 31, 2018, there was approximately $454.5 million of unused capacity under 2017 Master Transfer\nAgreement. During the year ended December 31, 2017, Carvana sold an aggregate of approximately $163.7 million in principal balances of finance\nreceivables under the 2016 Master Transfer Agreement and 2017 Master Transfer Agreement.\n\nThe purchasers engaged Carvana as the administrator of the trust and DriveTime as servicer of the receivables. In the year ended December 31,\n\n2018, we had aggregate earnings of $4.0 thousand for performing trust administrator functions for the purchasers and DriveTime had aggregate earnings of\n$4.0 million for performing servicing functions.\n\n- 46 -\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024355",
