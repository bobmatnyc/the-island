Through gaps in the greenery \nappear stone fountains, elephant statues, pools the size of tennis complexes \n(next to actual tennis complexes), and more clay roofs than one could count. \nIt's a monumental display of wealth, and it is rapidly expanding, not just \nhere but in Delray Beach, Jupiter, Palm Beach Gardens and Boca Raton, as \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033158 \nmoney pours out of the Northeast (and in some cases, from as far as London \nand Singapore) and into this already wealthy section of southeast Florida. \nApproximately 70 hedge and private equity funds are now headquartered \nhere, many of which have set up shop in the last two years, jacking up home \nprices and spurring a countywide initiative to become, as some have said, \n\"the new Greenwich.\" \nFor hedge fund managers who might normally be inclined toward \nWestchester or Connecticut, the allure of South Florida is as plain as grits \non toast. The homes are sprawling; the Intracoastal Waterway is a yachter's \nparadise. It has a glittering social scene. During high season—October \nthrough March—there might be several fundraisers on any given night. \nPerhaps the key factor, however: In Florida, there are no individual income \ntaxes, no estate taxes and no capital gains taxes. A hedge fund manager \nreporting $1 million in income can expect to pay only the federal \ngovernment, whereas his counterpart living in Connecticut pays that plus an \nextra $67,000. And if the poor schmuck were still in New York City? He'd \nbetter be ready to fork over $104,300. \nAs for why all of this is happening now, when Florida has long been a sunny \ntax haven, so to speak, financiers point to the upcoming application of \nSection 457A of the Internal Revenue Code. Before 457A was enacted, \ncertain fees and related earnings could grow tax deferred in offshore \naccounts for up to ten years. But now, according to the section, hedge fund \nmanagers will need to funnel all of the fees that were deferred before 2009 \nand their related earnings back into the U.S. by 2017. If a manager lives in \nFlorida when this happens, he's much less likely to pay exorbitant state \ntaxes on the whole amount. If he still lived in New York City? \nFuggedaboudit. \nIt's the job of Kelly Smallridge, president and CEO of the Palm Beach \nBusiness Development Board, to ensure that hedge fund and private equity \nmanagers are informed of these benefits, in the hopes that they, and their \nfirms, will become Palm Beach County's newest residents. She's developed a \nred-carpet tour that goes beyond looking at office space and real estate to \ninclude meeting headmasters at private schools, the school-district \nsuperintendent and the mayor and speaking with the governor's staff and \nCEOs who have moved their operations here. Plus, of course, a few nights \non the town. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033159 \nIn the winter, when the well-to-do from all over the Northeast visit Florida \nfor charity balls, the board hosts dinners and parties for prospective \nrelocators and local captains of industry. Last year, Smallridge and \ncompany sponsored a soiree aboard a $70 million yacht that featured Veuve \nClicquot, caviar and live jazz. Guests—who included the CEOs of a national \nIT company, a major finance company and a land developer, venture \ncapitalists, hedge fund managers and the creator of Goldman Sachs' prime \nbrokerage division—took private tours with the captain of the yacht. \nSmallridge is also working with former hedge fund CIO Dr. Rainford Knight \nto develop a club for local investment managers called SocialAlpha that \nencourages bankers in Palm Beach County's ritzy social scene to get to know \neach other. Even Florida governor Rick Scott has gotten involved, sending \npersonal letters to friends and prospects from the Northeast (the governor is \na former Greenwich resident and businessman) to convince them of \nFlorida's merits. \nSmallridge and Governor Scott are hoping to induce a snowball effect, and \nso far, it seems to be working. Every financier who moves south chips away \nat the primary reason to remain near New York City—the fact that everyone \nelse is there. That's not to say it's been easy. Florida is still Florida, and \npopular opinion has not been kind. Even Palm Beach, which has for the \nmost part dodged the insults hurled at the rest of the state, is known for its \nresidents' apocalyptically bad driving and worse Hawaiian shirts. \n\"There was a fair amount of trepidation,\" says Al Rabil III, managing \npartner and CEO of Kayne Anderson Real Estate Advisors, who made the \nmove from Armonk, New York, with 20 coworkers this summer. \"But once \neverybody got past the stereotypes and actually came and looked, that \nchanged.\" He says most of his employees weren't looking for bottle service \nand models anyway. The majority of those who have reached the upper \nechelons of financial management are married with children, and the appeal \nof a semi-tropical paradise with luxury restaurants, year-round recreation, \nand sophisticated socializing in a community far more tight-knit than \nManhattan (yes, that'sDonald Trump over there) is not lost on them. \nPorter's tour of Billionaire's Row was part of a modified version of one of \nthe Business Development Board's red-carpet tours that I took as part of \nresearching this story. I ate breakfast at the clubby Top of the Point \nrestaurant with some of the area's prominent financiers. A waiter in a \ncaptain's outfit served lobster rolls while a CPA, a lawyer and the executive \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033160 \ndirector of the Palm Beach County Education Commission touted the area's \nbenefits. I surveyed real estate and office space surrounded by miles of \nwater without once having my foot stepped on by a tourist. You can see how \nall this might sway someone who's on the fence. \nExploring the sugary beaches of South Florida, one starts to wonder why \nWall Streeters would be on the fence at all. Between the smiling locals and \nthe shopping on Worth Avenue, the Hiaasen-esque stereotypes recede. \nWhat remains are the facts: Take-home pay is higher, commutes are \nshorter, and it's just as fabulous as Manhattan, at least for four months of \nthe year. Meanwhile, no one in Florida even owns an ice scraper. With the \nInternet allowing more and more money managers to perform their work \nfrom nearly anywhere, there are few reasons not to make the move. \n\"Initially, it was a way to play golf and keep the wife and kids happy,\" says \nBrett Langbert, managing director and head of sales at I.A. Englander & Co. \n\"But once we moved down, it became a quality-of-life issue. There are \nunlimited things the kids can do outside. I have to tell you, my wife and I \nare so happy we haven't had to go to one of those indoor bouncy-castle \nplaces since we got here.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033161",
