  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n813\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nIn ve Magnetic Audiotape, 334 F.3d at\n208.\n\nJudge Robertson dismissed without\nprejudice the claims against Prince Sultan\nin his personal capacity for lack of person-\nal jurisdiction. Burnett I, 292 F.Supp.2d\nat 21-22. He rejected Plaintiffs’ argument\nthat Prince Sultan had purposefully direct-\ned his alleged activities at the United\nStates. Jd. at 22-23. Judge Robertson\nfound that the complaint’s claims that\nPrince Sultan donated money to founda-\ntions that allegedly funded al Qaeda\n“stop[ ] well short of alleging Prince Sul-\ntan’s actions were ‘expressly aimed’ or\n‘purposefully directed’ at the United\nStates.” Id. at 23 (citing Burger King and\nKeeton v. Hustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S.\n770, 774-75, 104 S.Ct. 1478, 79 L.Ed.2d 790\n(1984)). Judge Robertson also denied\nPlaintiffs’ request for discovery because\nthey did not provide an “outline of how\ntheir showing of minimum contacts might\nbe enhanced by jurisdictional discovery.”\nId. at 22.\n\nThis Court's record, which Plaintiffs\nclaim is more extensive than that before\nJudge Robertson, contains many examples\nof Osama bin Laden’s and al Qaeda’s pub-\nlic targeting of the United States. See\nBierstein Aff. in Opp. to Prince Sultan’s\nMotion to Dismiss, Exs. 1-24. The com-\nplaints also contain conclusory allegations\nthat Prince Sultan aided and abetted ter-\nrorism. See, eg., Burnett Complaint\n1363; Federal Complaint 11429-3831. But\nPlaintiffs do not offer any facts to lend\nsupport to their allegation that Prince Sul-\ntan purposefully directed his activities at\nthis forum by donating to charities that he\nknew at the time supported international\nterrorism. See Exec. Order 13244 (desig-\nnating certain branches of Al Haramain in\n2002 and later). “[Llegal conclusions done\nup as factual allegations are not facts and\ncannot substitute for facts.” Cornell, 2000\n\nWL 284222, at *2 (citing Papasan v. Al-\nlain, 478 U.S. 265, 286, 106 S.Ct. 2932, 92\nL.Ed.2d 209 (1986)). Plaintiffs have note\nprovided an “outline of how their showing\nof minimum contacts might be enhanced\nby jurisdictional discovery.” Burnett IT\n292 F.Supp.2d at 22. Accordingly, Prince\nSultan’s motions to dismiss the certain\nconsolidated and Federal complaints for\nlack of personal jurisdiction over the\nclaims concerning his personal acts are\ngranted. Plaintiffs’ request for jurisdic-\ntional discovery with respect to Prince Sul-\ntan is denied. Daventree, 349 F.Supp.2d\n736, at 761, 2004 WL 2997881, at *20 (find-\ning jurisdictional discovery is not neces-\nsary where the allegation of jurisdictional\nfacts fails to state a basis for the exercise\nof personal jurisdiction).\n\n2. Prince Turki\n\n[59] The allegations against Prince\nTurki are outlined in Part I.B.2. Because\nthe consolidated Plaintiffs do not allege\nany acts taken by Prince Turki in his\npersonal capacity, the Court only considers\nthe Federal Plaintiffs’ claim that Prince\nTurki made personal donations to certain\nSaudi charities. See Federal Complaint\n1452. The Federal complaint does not\nmake any specific jurisdictional allegations\nagainst Prince Turki. Rather, these Plain-\ntiffs rely on Calder, Rein, Daliberti, Pugh,\nand the modified due process standard for\nmass torts to argue that the September 11\nattacks were a foreseeable result of Prince\nTurki’s alleged support of certain Saudi\ncharities. See Federal Opp. to Prince\nTurki’s Motion to Dismiss at 22-23.\n\nThe Federal Plaintiffs have not present-\ned any specific facts from which this Court\ncould infer Prince Turki's primary and\npersonal involvement in, or support of, in-\nternational terrorism and al Qaeda.
