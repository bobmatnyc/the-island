  "text": "So far, no one I've talked to seems remotely interested in hiring what they see as a\n\"prostitute.\" They seem to want to be having sex with someone they find very attractive\nwho is also someone they feel like they can respect, whose intelligence they respect. For\nexample, someone I see occasionally -- the last time I saw him, he gave me money at the\nend and he said that he felt good about giving me the money because he knew I wouldn't\nspend it on, quote, \"a designer handbag.\" He seems to think that I am reasonably\nambitious and have my shit together, and he seems to feel more comfortable giving me\nmoney because he knows it goes towards my grad school costs and credit card debt. My\nability to write with proper grammar, without overusing emoticons, appears to be my\nbiggest sales point. Men have told me this outright.\n\nThat guy also mentioned feeling more comfortable because he thinks I'm from the same\nsocial class as he is. There are a lot of class issues coming up in these encounters, I think.\nBeing white and from an upper-middle-class background may help me get clients. My\nbackground has also given me a ton of confidence that puts me at an advantage when\nnegotiating. I do not think I radiate \"take advantage of me,\" and I (nicely) tell guys who\nstart doing that to go away.\n\nThe guy I was just talking about -- he also mentioned that he feels like he doesn't want to\nhave sex with someone that he doesn't feel at least a little bit connected to. There's a\ndistinction between meaningless sex and casual sex. I think these guys want casual sex --\nmaybe they aren't at the point where they want to deal with having a partner, or they're\nreally busy at work, or they already have another partner -- they want casual sex but not\nmeaningless sex.\n\nIn my encounters with these men, the money does two things. Firstly, it enables them to\nhave a relationship with me that they wouldn't otherwise be able to have. Secondly, it\nputs them in this position where they can give me something valuable and have that be\nappreciated. The guys I see really want to feel appreciated.\n\nClarisse Thorn: Do you feel like this has given you any new insight into gender\nroles?\n\nOlivia: Hmm.... It's made me feel more powerful. I definitely feel like I am the one with\nthe power in this situation. When I show up, I don't feel like -- here is this rich, powerful\nperson who is about to bestow wealth upon me. I feel like -- here is this person who is a\n\nbit sad and lonely, and maybe I can make their day better.\n\nA lot of the men who are on this site want to feel appreciated, so it's important to them\nthat the woman they're with give off the appearance of appreciating them. So for\nexample, on the website there's a lot of talk about sugar daddies being \"mentors\" or\n“benefactors” rather than clients. They seem to want some combination of me asking\nthem about their day, and they also want to feel like they're bestowing knowledge upon\nme about the world. One of the men I see will always talk about his opinions about\nmoney. He has complicated feelings about himself having money because he doesn't\ncome from money, so he's trying to work those out. But he also keeps telling me in a very\nserious voice that money will not make me happy, that nothing I can buy will make me\nhappy. I tell him that I can buy security and he says yes, that is one thing I can buy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018610",
