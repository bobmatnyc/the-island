So Alessi said, no, but this was not ina\nlawyer/client capacity, this is in a friend capacity.\n\nSO now we have Alessi putting him there at\nthe same time when young girls were there. And one of\nthe things that I picked up -- so is Alessi, is he able\nto figure out how these girls are? A photograph of\nVirginia Roberts is shown to Juan Alessi in the\ndeposition, and he I.D.s the photograph as, you know,\nV.R., so he had put two and two together.\n\nSo now I've got V.R. coming to the house at a\ntime when Mr. Dershowitz is also in the house, and\napparently spending, you know, two to three nights there\nand doing this four or five times a year.\n\nNow, Alessi wasn't the only one.
