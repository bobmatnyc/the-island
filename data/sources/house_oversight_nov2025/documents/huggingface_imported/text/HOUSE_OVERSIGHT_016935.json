  "text": "doing because we designed the algorithms at their heart. So when our computers\ngenerate a result, we feel that we intellectually grasp it.\n\nThe new machine-learning programs are different. Having recognized patterns\nvia deep neural networks, they come up with conclusions, and we have no idea exactly\nhow. When they uncover relationships, we don’t understand it in the same way as if we\nhad deduced those relationships ourselves using an underlying theoretical framework. As\ndata sets become larger, we won’t be able to analyze them ourselves even with the help\nof computers; rather, we will rely entirely on computers to do the analysis for us. So if\nsomeone asks us how we know something, we will simply say it is because the machine\nanalyzed the data and produced the conclusion.\n\nOne day a computer may well come up with an entirely new result—e.g., a\nmathematical theorem whose proof, or even whose statement, no human can understand.\nThat is philosophically different from the way we have been doing science. Or at least\nthought we had; some might argue that we don’t know how our own brains reach\nconclusions either, and that these new methods are a way of mimicking learning by the\nhuman brain. Nevertheless, I find this potential loss of understanding disturbing.\n\nDespite the remarkable advances in computing, the hype about AGI—a general-\nintelligence machine that will think like a human and possibly develop consciousness—\nsmacks of science fiction to me, partly because we don’t understand the brain at that level\nof detail. Not only do we not understand what consciousness is, we don’t even\nunderstand a relatively simple problem like how we remember a phone number. In just\nthat one question, there are all sorts of things to consider. How do we know it is a\nnumber? How do we associate it with a person, a name, face, and other characteristics?\nEven such seemingly trivial questions involve everything from high-level cognition and\nmemory to how a cell stores information and how neurons interact.\n\nMoreover, that’s just one task among many that the brain does effortlessly.\nWhereas machines will no doubt do ever more amazing things, they’re unlikely to be a\nreplacement for human thought and human creativity and vision. Eric Schmidt, former\nchairman of Google’s parent company, said in a recent interview at the London Science\nMuseum that even designing a robot that would clear the table, wash the dishes, and put\nthem away was a huge challenge. The calculations involved in figuring out all the\nmovements the body has to make to throw a ball accurately or do slalom skiing are\nprodigious. The brain can do all these and also do mathematics and music, and invent\ngames like chess and Go, not just play them. We tend to underestimate the complexity\nand creativity of the human brain and how amazingly general it is.\n\nIf AI is to become more humanlike in its abilities, the machine-learning and\nneuroscience communities need to interact closely, something that is happening already.\nSome of today’s greatest exponents of machine learning—such as Geoffrey Hinton,\nZoubin Ghahramani, and Demis Hassabis—have backgrounds in cognitive neuroscience,\nand their success has been at least in part due to attempts to model brainlike behavior in\ntheir algorithms. At the same time, neurobiology has also flourished. All sorts of tools\nhave been developed to watch which neurons are firing and genetically manipulate them\nand see what’s happening in real time with inputs. Several countries have launched\nmoon-shot neuroscience initiatives to see if we can crack the workings of the brain.\nAdvances in AI and neuroscience seem to go hand in hand; each field can propel the\nother.\n\n132\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016935",
