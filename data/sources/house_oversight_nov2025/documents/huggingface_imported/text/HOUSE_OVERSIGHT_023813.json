  "text": "Real-Life Learning Projects Considered &7\n\ndon’t we just tell them the facts and any underlying theories? The knowledge\nmetaphor, the one that says that teachers know some stuff that students\ndon’t, naturally leads teachers to tell students what they know.\n\nNow let’s consider corporate training.\n\nThe companies that contract with my company’ to build courses\nknow that we will not use the learning by telling method. Presumably\nthey are frustrated with the results that the telling method has pro-\nduced in courses that have been built for them by others. (In fact, they\nrefer to it as “death by PowerPoint.”) This is why they come to us. Still\nthey can’t help but ask the same subject-based question. How could\nthey not? It is all they know. They went to school. They see the world\nin the way that school taught them to see it.\n\nThey don’t ask the questions they should ask because they can’t.\nWe need to transform badly formed educational questions into prop-\nerly formed ones. We need to transform subject-based questions into\ncognitive process-based questions. This means changing statements\nabout the need to manage client relationships into statements about\ncognition, and statements about product launch into ones about cog-\nnition, and so on. What does it mean to make such transformations?\nIt means asking what one does when one manages client relationships\nor when one launches a product. This is, of course, exactly what we\nask clients in our first meeting with them. For example, we ask: What\ndoes one do when one launches a product?\n\nWhat I plan to do here is reveal what we do next, namely, the sub-\nject to cognitive ability transformation process. We must do the transfor-\nmation properly and then make clear what one does in course design\nafter one has figured out what really needs to be taught.\n\nLet’s start simple. Let’s imagine we want to train insurance adjust-\ners to decide what compensation a policy owner is entitled to after a\nhurricane hits his property. (Yes, I do live in Florida, but I can’t say I\ncare much about this process personally.) I found this on the Internet\ncovering this subject:\n\nCatastrophe Adjusting Refresher\n\nCourse Description: This is a course package comprised of three\ncourses plus a bonus section and downloadable documents.\n\nOne of the three courses is this:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023813",
