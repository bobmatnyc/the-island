  "text": "6 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nThey claimed that pollution from the plant, such as coal\ndust, ash, and water from the plant’s cooling system, had\ndestroyed or contaminated much of the surrounding air,\nland, and water. Relying on the audit report, they asserted\nseveral causes of action against the IFC, including negli-\ngence, nuisance, trespass, and breach of contract. The\nIFC maintained that it was immune from suit under the\nIOIA and moved to dismiss for lack of subject matter\njurisdiction.\n\nThe District Court, applying D.C.

Judge Pillard\nalso noted that the Third Circuit had expressly declined to\nfollow the D. C. Circuit’s approach. See OSS Nokalva, Inc.\nv. European Space Agency, 617 F. 3d 756 (CA3 2010).\n\nWe granted certiorari. 584 U.S.__ (2018).\n\nII\n\nThe IFC contends that the IOTA grants international\norganizations the “same immunity” from suit that foreign\ngovernments enjoyed in 1945. Petitioners argue that. it\ninstead grants international organizations the “same\nimmunity” from suit that foreign governments enjoy to-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028548",
