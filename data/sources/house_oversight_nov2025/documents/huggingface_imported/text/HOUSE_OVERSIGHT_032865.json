[jeevacation@gmail.com]\n\nSent: 5/17/2016 1:56:20 PM\n\nTo: Gerald 82rtcr\nSubject: Re:\n\nthanks for filling me in\n\nOn Tue, May 17, 2016 at 3:53 PM, Gerald Barton i wrote:\n\nMy Extraordinarily Talented, Outrageous Friend,\n\nThank you for asking how Iam doing. The short answer is very well. I hope that you are in good health and\ncontinue to use your special talents to make the world a better place and for your somewhat unique\namusements.\n\nThe longer answer to your question is that at the end of 2014 I closed down the office of Landmark, transferred\nall of the assets to pay all of the major creditors, except me, and found myself as broke as I was when you first\ncalled me that Friday after Thanksgiving, with my only remaining assets, a large capital loss, my reputation,\nand my energy.\n\nSince then, our luck has been better than even an optimist like me would expect. Being free of the $500,000 a\nday I was fined by the OTS, after several years they abandoned this fine, which was initiated strictly to ensure\nthat I had no opportunity to finance any new developments, I became involved with an extraordinary, large,\nimportant real estate development in Oklahoma City and two others in the D.C. area.\n\nThe bad news is that my dear friend and good partner, Aubrey McClendon, was killed in a single car accident\non March 2™ of this year and the development with great potential is now either delayed or abandoned. The\ngood news is that our involvement in a 1,000 acre development on Deep Creek Lake in western Maryland is in\nthe process of being financed and should be underway sometime this summer. Our second project is a 405\nacre development in Harper’s Ferry, West Virginia, that is probably the prettiest piece of property I know of in\nthe U.S. that is zoned and developable. Its business plan is now underway and we should be in the financing\nmode this fall. My impression is that there is a tremendous amount of money on the sidelines, but the top 5%\nor 10% that control it are terribly frightened of losing money they don’t need, while the 90% to 95% of the\ncitizens are continuing their daily labors somewhat frightened that they are not certain where next month’s or\nnext year’s mortgage payment is coming from.\n\nOn a lighter note, Donald Trump recently bought our development in Ireland, Doonbeg Golf Club. It has been\nrated the first or second best resort in Europe. To-date, to my surprise, he is managing it reasonably well,\nprobably because he is presently devoted to an endeavor that amuses him.\n\nJeffrey, I want you to understand that I am extremely pleased and not at all melancholy about my present\ncircumstances. Whenever I get an opportunity, I always visit those assets I helped create and almost without\nexception, I wish I had been smarter, but generally satisfied that I made a positive contribution and one much\nhigher than normally done by my competitors, because I am fortunate that the labor focus of my life has not\nattracted the best and the brightest.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032865",
