  "text": "there might be no response. The US, with its priceless collection of bombers and\nmissiles and million-man army, could not strike back for the simple reason that the\nnation’s field officers would have no way to talk to each other, or to commanders in\nWashington. The military radio and telephone systems America depended on for her\nsafety would not likely endure an initial Soviet strike. This was the problem Baran\nhad been told to solve.“At the time we didn’t know how to build a communication\nsystem that could survive even collateral damage by enemy weapons,” he recalled\nlater. RAND determined through computer simulations that the AT&T Long Lines\ntelephone system, a copper web that carried essentially all the nation’s military\ncommunications, would be cut apart by relatively minor physical damage.!°\n\nThe military had spent, already, a fortune on the problem. (They had spent half a\nfortune, it turned out, trying to hide it.) The result was an expensively designed,\ngorgeously featured telephone network linking military bases to strategic command\nposts. But because the lines and their switching centers were laced out in a pattern\nwith just a few big central nodes, like a bicycle wheel with spokes, it had almost no\nchance of surviving the very thing it was designed to help prevent, a Soviet strike. If\nyou gazed at an inked-out map of this network, with its central hub staffed by senior\ncommanders and then radiating lines out to bases and missile silos, it even looked,\nwell, like a target. If the USSR could bullseye those hubs with a bomb or two, the rest\nof the network would fold. The Soviets could do whatever they wanted: Invade\nBerlin, roll into France, obliterate Los Angeles. America’s military would be deaf.\nAnd as Soviet missiles became more accurate, this seemed an inevitability. “We will\nsoon be living in an era,” Baran wrote, “in which we cannot guarantee survivability\nof any single point.”\n\nThe situation, as a carefully screened handful of scientists at RAND knew, was in fact\neven more perilous. Shortly before Baran arrived at RAND, scientists testing\nhydrogen bomb designs in the Pacific discovered that radiation from their\nexplosions fuzzed communications for hundreds of miles. A Soviet attack, even if it\n\n105 “At the time”: There is a fair amount of debate about this question of if the\nInternet design was intended for survivability or if some other systemic need - such\nas linking research institutions - accounted for the distributed architecture that\nemerged. See, for instance, Barry M. Leiner, Vinton G. Cerf, et al, “A Brief History of\nthe Internet”, ACM SIGCOMM Computer Communication Review Volume 39 Issue 5,\nOctober 2009, 22-31. However, an examination of primary source documents shows\nthe evolution of Baran’s thinking clearly and produces documentary evidence for\nthe origins of the problem he and various figures at RAND were aiming to solve.\nOthers arrived at the packet switching model, but it is clear Baran’s path to the\ndesign emerged from the security problems he was considering.
