  "text": "Freedom House\n\nTightening the Screws: The Kremlin's Legal Campaign against Civil Society\n\ne@ JANUARY 2006: Amendments to Certain\nLegislative Acts of the Russian Federation\nThis law gave authorities the power to deny\nregistration to organizations that “threaten”\nRussia, bar foreigners from opening\norganizations, subject foreign funding to more\nscrutiny, and make the founding and operation of\norganizations excessively burdensome, including\nby imposing frequent audits and reporting\nrequirements.\n\ne@ JULY 2012: Amendments to the Law on\nNoncommercial Organizations, the Criminal\nCode, the Law on Public Associations, and the\nLaw on Combating Money Laundering and the\nFinancing of Terrorism\nThis package of measures, which included\nthe provision known as the “foreign agents\nlaw,” required nongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs) that receive foreign funding and carry\nout broadly defined “political activity” to register\nwith the Justice Ministry and meet onerous\nrequirements, including filing quarterly financial\nreports, submitting to annual and unscheduled\naudits, subjecting foreign donations to\nmonitoring, and marking all publications and\nevents with the “foreign agent” label. Penalties\nfor noncompliance include fines, suspension\nof funds, and imprisonment of personnel.\nOther amendments penalized creating and\nparticipating in “illegitimate” groups and groups\nthat urge citizens to shirk their civic duties or\nperform other illegal acts.\n\ne@ FEBRUARY 2014: Amendments to the Law on\nNoncommercial Organizations\nThis change greatly expanded the list of reasons\nfor unannounced audits of NGOs.\n\nConfronted by mass demonstrations, the authori-\nties ordered a rerun. The candidate of the reformist\nOrange coalition won that election, which was widely\nseen as free and honest.\n\nThe Orange Revolution was to have far-reaching reper-\ncussions. While democracies celebrated the outcome,\nrepressive regimes reacted with alarm. The concerns\nexpressed by Russian officials were soon echoed\n\ne@ JUNE 2014: Amendments to the Law on\nNoncommercial Organizations\nEnacted to strengthen enforcement of the\nforeign agents law, this legislation authorized\nthe Justice Ministry to register NGOs as foreign\nagents without their consent and without a court\norder, and shifted the burden of proof to NGOs,\ncompelling them to go to court to fight the label.\n\ne@ MAY 2015: Amendments to Certain Legislative\nActs of the Russian Federation\nKnown as the “undesirable organizations\nlaw,” this package of changes empowered the\nprosecutor general to shut down or restrict the\nactivities of NGOs that are deemed “undesirable,”\nvaguely defined as groups that pose “a threat\nto the foundation of the constitutional order of\nthe Russian Federation, the defense capability\nof the country, or the security of the state.”\nThe amendments bar such organizations from\nopening delegate offices, carrying out programs,\nand promoting their activities in Russia, and\nsubject collaborators with these NGOs to\npossible fines and imprisonment.\n\ne@ JUNE 2016: Amendments to the Law on Public\nAssociations and the Law on Noncommercial\nOrganizations\nThis legislation revised the loose definition of\n“political activity” under the foreign agents law,\nbut rather than narrowing the meaning of the\nterm, it applied the law's restrictions to any\nactivity aimed at influencing the government\nor public opinion. That could include opinion\nsurveys, monitoring of government agencies\nperformance, analysis of laws or policies, and\npetitions or other communications aimed at\ngovernment officials.\n\nin China, lran, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Venezuela, and\nother authoritarian countries. Vladimir Putin spoke\nof the color revolution as the latest form of American\ninterventionism, and began a process of restricting\nRussian NGOs that was to reach a climax a decade\nlater.\n\nYanukovych eventually won the presidency in a 2010\ncomeback, but a second protest-driven revolution\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\n23\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019257",
