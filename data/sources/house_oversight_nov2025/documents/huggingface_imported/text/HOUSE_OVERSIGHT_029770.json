  "text": "look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation.\n\n¢ Earlier versions of the U.S attorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have landed\nEpstein in prison for 20 years.\n\n* Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former Soviet\nrepublics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.\n\n¢ The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein’s private jets, which would be evidence of\nsex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was convicted of.\n\n* Epstein’s attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered private\ninvestigators to follow and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.\n\n¢ Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the Justice\nDepartment to pursue justice without making a political mess.”\n\nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of\nprivilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm\nBeach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\n\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis\n\nDuring Epstein’s term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his\nprivate Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—13\nmonths in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled\nmore than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform “massages” at his\nPalm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\n\n* Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe\n\n* The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den\n\nWith that, the known victims of Epstein’s sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against\nhim is closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of\nthe U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile.\n\nBut the question remains: Did Epstein’s wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton; Prince\nAndrew; former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and former Treasury\nSecretary Larry Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private jets—allow him to receive\nonly a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence? Was he able, with his limitless\nassets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Roy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis,\nand Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice?\n\nEpstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe\nhttp://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has learned—and\nhas widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency.\n\nHedge- fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last week.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029770",
