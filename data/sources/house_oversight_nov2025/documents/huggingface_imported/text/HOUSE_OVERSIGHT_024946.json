  "text": "rightful=2 Oroad. You ask how? I tell you: the global financial crisis is a challenge we have faced and surpassed\nin its most difficult stages. We are insistent on developing the education and obtaining excellence in all our\nprojects and our work, in addition to protecting our favorable environment for innovation and leadership. What\nwe have achieved over the past 10 years is characterized with excellence and leadership, and we are capable\nand determined to achieve what is more excellent, innovative and prominent in the future.\n\nAL ITTIHAD\n\nYour Highness, you asked the Ministry of Finance last year to prepare the federal budget\nof the State 2009. The early announcement prior to the global economic crisis has\nresulted in a deficit-free budget. Would the global crisis have implications on the 2010\nbudget, particularly with regard to the basic needs of Emirati citizens?\n\nIn the last three years, the federal budget was issued early and before entering the new fiscal year. The\nsubmission of the budget for 2009 without a deficit is because its main provisions have not been affected by the\nglobal financial crisis. I also do not think that 2010 budget will be affected. We still have seven months for the\nyear to end, and in my opinion this is quite a long period -- we may see by the end of it some positive indicators\nthat would help in accelerating the recovery of the global economy.\n\nAL ITTIHAD\n\nThere are those who say that the senior positions in Dubai are granted to a few selected\npeople, which is described as the phenomenon of the ''Super Man.” How would you\ncomment on this?\n\nMy answer is that all positions are available to competent Emiratis and we are very keen on rejuvenating our\nsystem. The “Super Man” phenomenon that you are talking about does not exist in our organizations and\ninstitutions. I am aware of those reports but would invite you and others to conduct a search within those senior\npositions to discover the truth on your own.\n\nAL ITTIHAD\n\nIn light of the global crisis some companies announced the postponement and\nrescheduling of some projects. What is the status of the infrastructure projects\nundertaken by the government subsequent to the changes in the strategic plans?\n\nWe will continue working on the infrastructure projects without any delay. What is currently under\nimplementation will be completed, while we will re-schedule the new projects. The changes of the strategic\nplan will be announced as soon as the committee finishes reviewing them. Plans are always subject to change in\nnormal times and in times of crisis.\n\nBy Al-Khaleej Daily\n\nDespite the competitive investment environment enjoyed by the UAE, with its advanced\nregional advantages, there are some aspects of the legislative environment that do not\nquite match the levels of development and state of the national economy. Do we expect\nany updating of the present laws, soon?\n\nThe economy is like a living being, whose demands and needs change with constant growth and development.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024946",
