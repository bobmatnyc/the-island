What the hell were these people talking about, he\nasked me. Why were they missing the forest for the trees. “The true story of Camp\nDavid,” he said, “was that for the first time in the history of the conflict, you and I,\nthe Prime Minister of Israel and the President of the United States, placed on the\ntable a proposal, based on Resolutions 242 and 338, very close to the Palestinian\ndemands. And Arafat refused to accept it as a basis of negotiations, walked out of\nthe room, and deliberately turned to terrorism.” All the rest, President Clinton said,\nwas gossip.\n\nAll of it was now irrelevant, too. His parameters were off the table. Palestinian\nviolence against Israelis was getting ever deadlier. And I was out of politics. When\nI delivered my final remarks to a Labor Party meeting, I was asked whether I was\nleaving politics for good. I replied that I would always remain a member of Labor.\nBut I saw my role as a bit like when I'd left the army. “I’m a reserve officer,” I\nsaid, adding that I hoped I would not be called back to duty any time soon.\n\nI had been Prime Minister for only 21 months. But I'd been in politics for six\nyears, and in uniform for nearly thirty-six: in public service for more than four\ndecades. Now, suddenly, I was a private citizen. And for a few years, I actually\nstayed that way.\n\n394\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028242",
