  "text": "MEMO TO PARTICIPANTS\nre: CONVERSATIONS\n\nAs most of you are aware, I created TED in 1984 and\nchaired it through 2002. During that time I created\nTEDMED in 1995 and the eg Conference in 2006. For\nall those meetings I developed an 18-minute talk and\na series of rules called the TED Commandmenis.\n\nSeveral of you have asked ‘well what are the new\nguidelines as they relate to the WWW Conference’?\n\n1 Participants have all been sent the schedule\n\nlisting the person with whom they have\n\nbeen paired, attached again below.\n\n2 Ifyou go to the participants page on the web\n\nsite, you can click on that person’s name and link\n\nto his or her biographical information.\n\n3 Ihave developed a list of 30 different premises or\npostulations that will begin you in improvised conversation.\n4 Ihave tried this and it works.\n\n5 You will be facing each other on comfortable\n\ncouches and not the audience.\n\n6 There will be approximately 150 people in the\naudience, which will be comprised of fellow participants,\nguests and individuals invited by sponsors.\n\n7 Absolutely no preparation is necessary.\n\n8 You will not be selling a book, charity, project or religion.\n9 As long as the conversation holds my attention and\nmy perceived attention of the audience, you will be in\nconversation. At the conclusion, I will with reasonable\npoliteness call up the next two individuals.\n\n10 Ifthe conversation is fabulous but goes on so long\n\nas to potentially cause us to miss our lunch, I will also\nend it and the two of you can continue it over lunch.\n\n11 There will be no lectern but there will be a side\n\ntable for a cup of coffee or glass of water.\n\n12 There is no strict time schedule but I will\n\nattempt to keep the order of the final schedule.\n\n13 On occasion I might take the liberty part way into\n\na given conversation to add a third person, another\nparticipant or simply another member of the audience,\nwhom I know can add constructively to the conversation.\n14 The entire meeting will be filmed as inconspicuously\nas possible from the far left and right of the stage\n\nand with one small camera in the audience.\n\n15 At this moment there are no plans to live-stream\n\nany of the conference. There will be an app with access\nto a server to hold the conversations. It is planned that\nthis will be available on 1 December and will include a\nrunning line of translation into several languages.\n\n16 The app will also contain a large body of curated\npersonal information about you. Further explanation\nabout this will come to you next week.\n\n17 Ihave personally worked out the breaks, lunches and\ndinners and I believe they will be of the highest quality and in\n\nrooms that will delight you, both at Esri and at The Mission Inn.\n\n18 Obviously there is a lot of risk about the\nconversations, particularly the quality, spontaneity,\nclarity, improvisation and surprise.\n\n19 The goal is to find some threads that have not\nemerged before as you speak with your partner,\nwhich will encapsulate a type of honesty and a non-\npredicted path in response to each other.\n\n20 This has happened in my several tests of this idea.\n21 Torepeat, Iam endeavoring to make the filming,\nambiance, location and lack of press all focus on\nyour comfort and the quality of your experience.\nThis above all is my concern and my goal.\n\n22 Improvised conversation in this manner is a new\nform but a wonderful conversation is perhaps the\noldest human media for creative discourse. So in\nthat sense, this isa great leap backwards.\n\n23 It will be a wonderful salon and an absolutely\nimmersive experience with extraordinary people.\n\nMEMO TO PARTICIPANTS\nre: FUTURE APP\n\nI trust each of you has read my 24-point memo called\nWWW Conference Conversation Guidelines with 24 points\nthat I believe give the spirit of the meeting itself. I’ve\n\nhad excellent response from many of you as well as\n\nfrom sponsors and attendees. This memo addresses the\noutcome of the conference, in other words, what I do with\nthe filming of these approximately 30 conversations.\n\n1 It will be filmed in black and white by a team directed\n\nby Jon Kamen and Sidney Beaumont of @radical.media,\n\nand John Halloran of John Halloran Associates.\n\n2 It will be unedited. There will be a camera on\n\neach of the individuals in conversation, as well as a\n\nlong camera on the three of us sitting on stage.\n\n3 Michael Smolens and David Orban of dotSUB will\n\nthen translate it into perhaps 10 languages and adda\n\nrunning translation in English, which will address the\nlanguage needs of 90% plus of the world’s population.\n\n4 This will live on a server and be accessed by\n\nan app that has a release date at this juncture of 1\n\nDecember. The app will also contain a great deal of\nadditional information on each of the presenters.\n\n5 The additional curated stuff—photos, videos,\n\nand links is what this memo is focused on.\n\n6 Scrollmotion has already done two extraordinary\n\nversions of the organization and design of this app. They\n\nhave offices in San Diego and New York City.\n\n7 There will be a series of unique videos on which I will\ncomment later, made where appropriate of you in situ.\n\n8 The video of the entire conference of course can\n\nbe accessed by pairings of speakers from a list and\n\nviewed as you would at the conference showing\n\nindividuals in improvised conversation. However, one\n\ncould also double click on a single name and go into\n\nthis visual biography of each of the participants.\n\n9 The demo can be found at\nhttp://vimeo.com/user7992663/review/47187545/29ddc526fo\nThe password is WWW. It shows an extremely brief version of\nC. K. Williams, the Pulitzer Prize winning poet, in which you\ncannot only see a bio, for which we will ask a major expansion,\nbut also photographs of the covers of a few of his 11 books. We\nwould also like to have all of his books, which you will be able\nto order form the app, some outtake videos, not from the\nconference but from other sources that we would identify, and\nthat you will identify, as well as, in the case of C. K. Williams,\nmany pages, a few shown here, of his personally edited\nwritings of his poetry—something you can’t find on YouTube,\na presentation or in a book, or perhaps anywhere but this app.\n10 The idea of this app is to get a behind the scenes,\n\nbehind the curtain, personalized journey through\n\neach individual, which will also have a list of links\n\nto suggested articles, reviews, YouTubes and other\n\nmaterial that will fill out this visual biography.\n\n11 This is an important point: if you Google Richard\nWurman, you come up with perhaps 450,000 citations.\n\nThe number changes daily. This would amount to 40,000+\n\npages, which of course nobody looks at. Basically it’s junk\nbig data, and people mostly focus on one article and a\nwikipedia entry. The attempt here is to have the first primitive\ndevelopment of a platform for beginning to assuage some\ncuriosity in the beginning of looking at a visual biography of\nat least these 50 people. If the platform works it’s scalable.\nThat’s the idea of a new modality. If it works for people\nperhaps it will work for healthcare and other subjects.\n\n12 I’m putting together a team of people consisting of Ali\nSmolens, who will help curate some of the materials for\nmany of you, Paul Kandarian, a magazine writer friend\n\nof mine from Rhode Island, and three others plus Blaise\nZerega, CEO of FORA.tv who has agreed to make some\noriginal, simple videos such as Frank Gehry walking around\nhis office showing and discussing models of buildings that\nhe has not built, or variations of for instance the 8 Spruce\nStreet tower in New York or hopefully Craig Venter’s\nlaboratories in a walk-through, E.O. Wilson’s offices, etc. etc.\n13 So this is a request for the following: please start thinking\nabout the stuff that you’ve never shown: everything from\nbaby pictures, pictures of your pets, pictures of your office,\npictures of your home, things that make you real. Multiple\nphotographs of yourself, perhaps a strip of photographs of\nyou taken in a photo booth at an amusement park that you\nhave in a drawer. Writings that you’ve done that show your\nedits, something that shows you’re real, human, and shows\nyour process. Pictures of your laboratories. Agree to have\nsomebody do a 5- or 10-minute walk through with you in your\noffice or your lab or your place of work or your architectural\nstudio. Videos or DVDs that for example I know Moshe\nSafdie has which he makes to describe what a building will\nlook like in computer graphics to a client. I know he has a\nfantastic one of an apartment house in Singapore. And I’m\nsure Bjarke has similar things that he generally does not\nrelease. Covers of books about you, covers of books by you. A\nlist of articles that you think critically describes you and links\nto YouTubes or other videos or other citations that you think\nand you have curated yourself that make you particularly\ninteresting, not the half a million available on line. Julie\nTaymor most have lots of stuff as well as David Blaine.\n\n14 We hope to have this put together, along with the\n\nentire conference, for release by 1 December and promote\n\nit immediately after Thanksgiving with the help of\n\nIDG, Flipboard (Mike McCue), Esri, IIR and others. I\n\nam going to ask for your cooperation out in Redlands at\n\nthe conference and I will have additional copies of this\n\nand the other memo to give you when you register.\n\n15 Attached are technical specifications for those of\n\nyou who understand them yourself. Otherwise please\n\nshow them to somebody in your office under the age of\n\n30 who automatically understands them, who could help\n\nus translate whatever you send us in a usable format. I\n\ndon’t understand them myself but I’m sure some of you\nhave a better handle on this than I do. These will make\n\nthe process smooth and efficient and within budget.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017571",
