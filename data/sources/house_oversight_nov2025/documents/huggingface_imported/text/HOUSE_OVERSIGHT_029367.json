  "text": "make no mistake — ISIS is part of the\nradical Islamic web of terrorism. A web\nthat is loosely knit, yet survives on\nstrictly restricted resources — and\ndemonstrates operational flexibility,\nsurvivability and a fanatic adherence to\nthe goal.\n\n¢ We're talking about ALQ,\nJabhat al-Nusra in Syria, Lashkar-e-\nTaiba in India, the Houthis in Yemen,\nthe Shabab in Sumali, Boko Haram in\nNigeria and many more — all across the\nMuslim strip, from Marrakesh to\nBangladesh.\n\ne And this web is very resilient.\nDealing with it will take war lasting for\na generation, not just a few years.
