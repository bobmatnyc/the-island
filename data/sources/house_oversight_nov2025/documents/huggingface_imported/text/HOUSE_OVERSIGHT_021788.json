  "text": "“In their mind that would be an adequate resolution,” Mr. Weinstein said. “Our view is\nthat is not enough of a punishment to fit the crime that occurred.”\n\nThe lurid details of the case have captivated wealthy circles in Palm Beach and New\nYork and transformed Mr. Epstein, who shuns publicity and whose business depends on\ndiscretion, into a figure of public ridicule.\n\nHe said he has been trailed by stalkers and has become the target of lawsuits. In recent\nmonths, he said, he received over 100 letters a week asking for money or jobs as a\nmasseuse. He recently received a package of gold-tinted condoms.\n\nIt has been a long, strange journey from Coney Island, where Mr. Epstein grew up in\nmiddle-class surroundings. He taught briefly at Dalton, the Manhattan private school, and\nthen joined Bear Stearns, becoming a derivatives specialist. He struck out on his own in\nthe 1980s.\n\nHis business is something of a mystery. He says he manages money for billionaires, but\nthe only client he is willing to disclose is Leslie H. Wexner, the founder of Limited\nBrands.\n\nAs Mr. Epstein explains it, he provides a specialized form of superelite financial advice.\nHe counsels people on everything from taxes and trusts to prenuptial agreements and\npaternity suits, and even provides interior decorating tips for private jets. Industry sources\nsay he charges flat annual fees ranging from $25 million to more than $100 million.\n\nAs it became clear that he was headed for jail, Mr. Epstein has tried to put on a brave\nface. “Your body can be confined, but not your mind,” he said in a recent interview by\nphone.\n\nBut the strains were showing. “I am anxious,” he said in another recent interview,\nreferring to how inmates would treat him. “I make a great effort to treat people equally,\nbut I recognize that I might be perceived as one of the New York arrogant rich.”\n\nJail will certainly be a big change. Mr. Epstein is a man of precise, at times\nunconventional, habits. He starts his mornings with a secret-ingredient bran muffin\nprepared by his chef. He seems to have a germ phobia. He never wears a suit, preferring\nmonogrammed sweatsuits and jeans. And he rarely attends meetings — “I never have to\nbe anywhere,” he tells his pilots, when he cautions them to avoid flying through chancy\nweather.\n\nLooking back, Mr. Epstein admits that his behavior was inappropriate. “I am not\nblameless,” he said. He said he has taken steps to make sure the same thing never\nhappens again.\n\nFor starters, Mr. Epstein has hired a full-time male masseur (the man happens to be a\n\nformer Ultimate Fighting champion). He also has organized what he calls a board of\ndirectors of friends to counsel him on his behavior.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021788",
