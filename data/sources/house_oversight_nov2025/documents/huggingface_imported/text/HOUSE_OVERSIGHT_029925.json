  "text": "﻿For years, Ted Kaptchuk performed\nacupuncture at a tiny clinic in Cambridge,\na few miles from his current\noffice, at the Harvard Medical School.\nHe opened for business in 1976, on a\nstreet so packed with alternative healers\nthat it was commonly referred to as\n“quack row.” Kaptchuk had just returned\nfrom Asia, where, as an exiled alumnus\nof the turbulent sixties, he had spent four\nyears honing his craft. “There were lots\nof alternatives on that street in those\ndays, but no practitioners of Chinese\nmedicine,” Kaptchuk, who is sixty-four\nand still lives in the neighborhood, told\nme recently as we sipped (Chinese) tea\nin the study of his house. “The area is a\nlittle too L. L. Bean for my taste now,”\nANNALS OF SCIENCE\nTHE POWER OF NOTHING\nCould studying the placebo effect change the way we think about medicine?\nBY MICHAEL SPECTER\nhe said. “It was a different place then.”\nNot long after Kaptchuk arrived in\nBoston, he treated an Armenian woman\nfor chronic bronchitis. A few weeks later,\nshe showed up in his office with her husband,\nwho had a Persian rug slung over\nhis shoulder. He nodded to Kaptchuk and\nsaid, “This is for you.” Kaptchuk accepted\nthe rug, which he still owns, but had no\nidea what he had done to earn it. “Oh,\ndoctor, you have been so wonderful,” the\nwoman told him. “You cured me. I was\nabout to have an operation on my ovaries\nand the pain went away the day you saw\nme.” Kaptchuk never spoke to the woman\nagain, but he has been unable to get her\nout of his mind. “There was no fucking\nway needles or herbs did anything for that\nScientists are now seriously investigating—and debating—our response to sugar pills.\nwoman’s ovaries,” he told me, still looking\nmystified, thirty-five years later. “It had to\nbe some kind of placebo, but I had never\ngiven the idea of a placebo effect much attention.\nI had great respect for shamans—\nand I still do. I have always believed there\nis an important component of medicine\nthat involves suggestion, ritual, and belief—all\nideas that make scientists scream.\nStill, I asked myself, Could I have cured\nher? How? I mean, what could possibly\nhave been the mechanism?”\nAt the time, few serious scientists\nwould have entertained such questions,\nlet alone allowed words like “ritual” and\n“belief ” to seep into a conversation about\nmedicine. Placebos had a bad name,\nwhich is not surprising, since they have\nbeen used primarily to deceive people. In\nclinical trials, if a drug and a sugar pill\nproduce similar results, the drug has generally\nbeen considered worthless. But the\ndefinition of medical treatment is changing,\nand so are attitudes about placebos.\nThis year, Harvard created an institute\ndedicated wholly to their study, the Program\nin Placebo Studies and the Therapeutic\nEncounter. It is based at the Beth\nIsrael Deaconess Medical Center and\nKaptchuk was named its director. He\nhas already recruited leading researchers\nfrom around the world, in disciplines as\ndiverse as neuroanatomy and semiotics.\nThe program was formed to explore an\nidea that even twenty years ago would\nhave seemed preposterous: that placebos—given\ndeliberately—might be deployed\nin clinical practice. As medicine.\nKaptchuk has no shortage of critics.\nThey acknowledge the power of the\nmind to influence health but question\nthe rigor of studies suggesting that placebos\ncould possibly prove as valuable as\ndrugs. Indeed, the idea of dispensing\nsugar pills is jarring even to those who,\nlike Kaptchuk, are enthusiastic about it.\nAfter all, placebos have almost always\nbeen defined as exactly what medicine\nis not. “I realized long ago that at least\nsome people respond even to the suggestion\nof treatment,” Kaptchuk said.\n“We know that. We have for centuries.\nBut unless we figured out how that process\nworked, and unless we did it with\ndata that other researchers would consider\nvalid, nobody would pay attention\nto a word we said.”\nThe research has been propelled in\nlarge measure by the emerging discipline\nANDERS WENNGREN\n30 THE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011\nof neuroimaging—which, like a live satellite\nfeed from inside the human body,\npermits scientists to track precisely how\na person reacts to a drug (or a placebo) as\nsoon as he takes it. An injection of saline,\nfor example, that has been described as a\ndrug not only will reduce symptoms of\nParkinson’s disease but can help a patient\nproduce more of the dopamine that\nthe disease destroys. Results like those\nhave provided scientists with chemical\nevidence of something they had long\nsuspected: simply believing in a treatment\ncan be as effective as the treatment\nitself. In several recent studies, placebos\nhave performed as well as drugs that\nAmericans spend millions of dollars on\neach year.\nTransforming interesting laboratory\nfindings into medicine is never simple,\nhowever, particularly when those findings\ninvolve fake pills and sham injections.\nSome people clearly respond\nbetter to placebos than others, though\nwe don’t know why; some illnesses and\nafflictions are more amenable to suggestion\nthan others; and many of the most\nintriguing findings are tenuous. Even so,\nthe recent research is difficult to dismiss.\nThrough conditioning techniques, for\nexample, our brain can “learn” different\nkinds of placebo effects: people first given\nmorphine and then a placebo have one\nneurochemical response, while people\nwho take ibuprofen followed by a placebo\nhave another. Different “doses”\ncause different reactions, and studies\nhave demonstrated that people who\nsuffer from headaches and consume aspirin\nregularly can associate the shape,\nthe color, and even the taste of a pill with\na decrease in pain. The value of treatments\nlike those—which have none of\nthe side effects of drugs—would be immense,\nbut placebos are not pharmaceuticals,\nand no reputable researcher has\nsuggested that they will soon be for sale\nat your local pharmacy.\nKaptchuk acknowledges that placebos\nare not magic potions. “Placebos\ndon’t shrink tumors,” he said. “They\ndon’t make blind people see. If you are\nparalyzed, they won’t help you walk.” He\ndeplores the grandiose claims of alternative\nmedicine and prefers to rely on data.\n“Ultimately, I am not a zealot or even a\ntrue believer,” he said. “I am sure that I do\nnot understand the placebo effect. I ask\nquestions, hopefully valuable questions,\nand we will see where the research lands.”\nKaptchuk practiced acupuncture for\nhalf his adult life. But he stopped twenty\nyears ago. Despite the popularity of acupuncture,\nclinical studies continually fail\nto demonstrate its effectiveness—a fact\nthat Kaptchuk doesn’t dispute. I asked\nhim how a person who talks about the\nprimacy of data and disdains what he\ncalls the “squishiness” of alternative medicine\ncould rely so heavily on a therapy\nwith no proven value. Kaptchuk smiled\nbroadly. “Because I am a damn good\nhealer,” he said. “That is the difficult\ntruth. If you needed help and you came\nto me, you would get better. Thousands\nof people have. Because, in the end, it\nisn’t really about the needles. It’s about\nthe man.”\nFor most of human history, placebos\nwere a fundamental tool in any physician’s\narmamentarium—sometimes the\nonly tool. When there was nothing else\nto offer, placebos were a salve. The word\nitself comes from the Latin for “I will\nplease.” In medieval times, hired mourners\nparticipating in Vespers for the Dead\noften chanted the ninth line of Psalm\n116: “I shall please the dead in the land\nof the living.” Because the mourners were\nhired, their emotions were considered insincere.\nPeople called them “placebos.”\nThe word has always carried mixed\nconnotations. Thomas Jefferson wrote\napprovingly of what he called a “pious\nfraud,” and noted that “one of the most\nsuccessful physicians I have ever known\nhas assured me that he used more bread\npills, drops of coloured water, and powders\nof hickory ashes, than of all other\nmedicines put together.” But, as increasingly\nspecific knowledge about human\nanatomy emerged, people began to demand\nscientific answers to medical questions.\nKnowledge displaced faith, and\nhuman health improved rapidly. Antibiotics\nare real; placebos are not.\nThe first publicly acknowledged placebo-controlled\ntrial—and still among\nthe most remarkable—took place at the\nrequest of King Louis XVI, in 1784,\nunder the direction of Benjamin Franklin,\nthen the American Ambassador to\nFrance. The German physician Franz\nAnton Mesmer had become famous in\nVienna for a new treatment he called\n“animal magnetism,” and he claimed to\nhave discovered a healing fluid that\nTHE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011 31\ncould “cure” many ailments. Mesmer\nbecame highly sought after in Paris,\nwhere he would routinely “mesmerize”\nhis followers—one of whom was Marie\nAntoinette. The King wasn’t buying it,\nhowever, and he asked a commission of\nthe French Academy of Sciences to\nlook into the claims. (The members included\nFranklin, the chemist Antoine\nLavoisier, and Joseph Guillotin—who\ninvented the device that would eventually\nseparate the King’s head from his\nbody.) The commission replicated some\nof Mesmer’s sessions, and, in one case,\nasked a young boy to hug magnetized\ntrees that were presumed to contain the\nhealing powers invoked by Mesmer. He\ndid as directed and responded as expected:\nhe shook, convulsed, and\nswooned. The trees, though, were not\nmagnetic, and Mesmer was denounced\nas a fraud. Placebos and lies were intertwined\nin the public mind.\nIt was another hundred and fifty years\nbefore scientists began to focus on the\nrole that emotions can play in healing.\nDuring the Second World War, Lieutenant\nColonel Henry Beecher—who\nwent on to become the first chairman of\nthe anesthesia department at Massachusetts\nGeneral Hospital—attempted to\nassess the degree to which the severity\nof a soldier’s injuries corresponded to\nthe amount of pain he felt. In Europe,\nBeecher met with more than two hundred\nsoldiers, gravely wounded but still\ncoherent enough to talk; he asked each\nman if he wanted morphine. Seventyfive\nper cent declined.\nBeecher was astounded. He knew\nfrom his experience before the war that\ncivilians with similar injuries would have\nbegged for morphine, and he had seen\nhealthy soldiers complain loudly about\nthe pain associated with minor inconveniences,\nlike receiving vaccinations. He\nconcluded that the difference had to do\nwith expectations; a soldier who survived\na terrible attack often had a positive outlook\nsimply because he was still alive.\nBeecher made a simple but powerful observation:\nour expectations can have a\nprofound impact on how we heal.\nArmed with this information, and\nwith his conviction that the placebo\neffect could be harnessed to help relieve\nsuffering, Beecher returned to the United\nStates and continued his research. In\n1955, he published an article called “The\nPowerful Placebo,” in which he wrote\nthat “placebos have a high degree of therapeutic\neffectiveness in treating subjective\nresponses.” The paper has been cited\nmore than a thousand times by other scientists,\nand Beecher’s conclusion—that\nthe placebo effect plays a critical role\nin almost any medical intervention—\ninfluenced much of what has followed in\nclinical research. His basic supposition\nwas correct: emotions and expectations\ncan affect our perception of pain.\nBefore Beecher’s work, new drugs\nwere tested in a haphazard manner; since\nthen, they have always been compared\nwith a placebo or with another drug. But\nBeecher’s methodology was deeply\nflawed. Although he reported that placebos\nwere effective more than a third of\nthe time, he shrugged off a phenomenon\nknown as “regression to the mean.” Over\ntime, the condition of most patients\nimproves, with or without treatment.\nA person who enrolls in a clinical study\nwhen he is feeling particularly bad is\nlikely to improve solely as a result of the\nnatural course of the illness, not because\nhe was given a placebo. (And people\noften enroll in such studies when they are\nsickest.) A patient who knows that he is\nin a study also may expect a better therapeutic\nresult than one who doesn’t. If you\nbelieve that doctors are particularly attentive,\nyou can get better more rapidly, even\nif they aren’t. This is known as the Hawthorne\neffect. (There is also a “nocebo\neffect.” Expecting a placebo to do harm\nor cause pain makes people sicker, not\nbetter. When subjects in one notable\nstudy were told that headaches are a side\neffect of lumbar puncture, the number of\nheadaches they reported after the study\nwas finished increased sharply.)\nFor years, researchers could do little\nbut guess at the complex biology of the\nplacebo response. A meaningful picture\nbegan to emerge only in the nineteenseventies,\nwith the discovery of endorphins:\nsubstances secreted in the brain\nthat are chemically similar to opiates like\nmorphine and heroin. The discovery led\nto the novel idea that, in effect, the brain\nproduces its own pharmacy. In 1978,\nthree scientists from the University of\nCalifornia at San Francisco—Jon Levine,\nNewton Gordon, and Howard Fields—\ndecided to investigate whether endorphins\nmight explain why patients who\nreceived placebos often reported a\nsignificant reduction in pain. People recovering\nfrom dental surgery were told\nthat they were about to receive a dose of\nmorphine, saline, or a drug that might\nincrease their pain. By then, researchers\nhad learned not only about the nocebo\neffect but that a suggestion of relief will\noften trigger the production of endorphins,\nso they were not surprised that patients\nreceiving saline reported reduced\npain.\nWhat came next, however, fundamentally\nreshaped the field. The researchers\ndismissed the subjects who received\nmorphine and then divided the\nremaining participants into those who\nresponded to the placebo and those who\ndidn’t. Then they introduced Naloxone\ninto patients’ I.V. drips. Naloxone was\ndeveloped to counteract overdoses of\nheroin and morphine. It works essentially\nby latching onto, and thus locking\nup, key opioid receptors in the central\nnervous system. The endorphins that we\nsecrete attach themselves to the same receptors\nin the same way, so Naloxone\nblocks them, too. The researchers theorized\nthat, if endorphins had caused the\nplacebo effect, Naloxone would negate\ntheir impact, and it did. The Naloxone\ncaused those who responded positively to\nthe placebos to experience a sharp increase\nin pain; the drug had no effect on\nthe people who did not respond to the\nplacebo. The study was the first to provide\nsolid evidence that the chemistry behind\nthe placebo effect could be understood—and\naltered.\n“It was one of those studies that make\nthe scales fall from your eyes,” Kaptchuk\ntold me. “I had just started to think about\nthe placebo effect—scientifically and historically.\nAnd here comes this paper that\nsays that, even if it’s all in your head, there\nis still a biological mechanism driving\nthese reactions. It was very exciting.”\nKaptchuk assumed that the results\nwould add legitimacy to the field.\nHe was wrong. “Things are better than\nthey were,” he said. “But even now, you\nknow, people at Harvard talk about placebos\nthe way the Popes used to talk\nabout medicine. They declared that Jews\nwere not allowed to treat Christians—\nnot because they were not good doctors\nbut because it would have been ethically\nwrong. These are ethical judgments masquerading\nas science. Because from the\n32 THE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011\nbeginning I kept having this nagging\nthought: what is so bad about getting\nbetter from a placebo?”\nThat kind of thinking, still hard for\nmost doctors to accept, was heretical in\n1990, when Kaptchuk arrived at Harvard.\n“People kept saying, ‘Oh, this is just\nthe placebo effect.’ You would hear that\nevery day,” Kaptchuk said. He had spent\nyears studying Chinese medicine (and\nmedical history), and this made no sense\nto him. “I thought, Ted, step back a\nminute. This wasn’t just something that\nwas a negative. It was something that\nneeded to be understood.”\nSlowly, over the past decade, researchers\nhave begun to tease out the\nstrands of the placebo response. The\nfindings, while difficult to translate into\nmedicine, have been compelling. In most\ncases, the larger the pill, the stronger the\nplacebo effect. Two pills are better than\none, and brand-name pills trump generics.\nCapsules are generally more effective\nthan pills, and injections produce a more\npronounced effect than either. There is\neven evidence to suggest that the color of\nmedicine influences the way one responds\nto it: colored pills are more likely\nto relieve pain than white pills; blue pills\nhelp people sleep better than red pills;\nand green capsules are the best bet when\nit comes to anxiety medication.\nConditioning and expectations matter,\nand so does learned behavior. In the\neighties, Levine and Gordon divided a\ngroup of postoperative patients into three\nsections: those in the first section received\nmorphine secretly, those in the\nsecond were told they would receive\nmorphine (and did), and those in the\nthird were given a placebo that was described\nas a powerful pain reliever. The\nresults were startling. Patients who were\ntold that they would receive a painkiller,\nwhether they actually received it or not,\nhad the same experience in the trial as\nthose who secretly received between six\nand eight milligrams of morphine—a\nsignificant amount. The covert dose had\nto be increased to twelve milligrams to\nsurpass the effect of the placebo. Over\nthe past two decades, the Italian neuroscientist\nFabrizio Benedetti (who studied\nwith Gordon and Levine), and Luana\nColloca, a colleague of Benedetti’s, who\nis now based in the United States, at\nthe National Institutes of Health, have\nexpanded on these studies. They have\nfound, for example, that diazepam—\nmore commonly known as Valium—has\nno discernible effect on anxiety unless a\nperson knows he is taking it. And, increasingly,\nstudies like those have been\ncarried out with the help of imaging\ntechniques—such as PET scans and functional\nM.R.I.s—that can track brain\nchanges as they happen. These advances\nin brain imaging, along with an increased\nunderstanding of neurochemicals, have\ntransformed a vague and mysterious notion\ninto a tangible effect that scientists\nconsider worthy of investigation.\n“What’s exciting here is that, if we are\nto talk about using placebos in a clinical\nsetting, they would have to have a measurable\neffect and a biology we understand,”\nWayne Jonas told me. Jonas is an\ninteresting hybrid in a world often\nsharply divided between conventional\nand alternative therapies. In the early\nnineties, he served as the director of the\nMedical Research Fellowship Program\nat the Walter Reed Army Institute of\nResearch, in Washington, D.C. He went\non to run the Office of Alternative Medicine\nat the National Institutes of Health,\nfrom 1995 to 1999. Today, Jonas is the\npresident of the Samueli Institute, a\nWashington research group devoted to\nshifting the focus of health care from\ntreatment to prevention.\n“The morphine studies bring us a long\nway,” he said. So did a recent investigation\nby Kaptchuk, in which participants\n“Bore me to sleep, Daddy.”\nsuffering from irritable-bowel syndrome\nwere not deceived about their treatment;\nin fact, they were told in great detail about\nthe placebos they received and that they\nwere often as effective as real medicine.\nThe pills brought them relief.\nFor many people in the field, results\nlike those achieved in the morphine and\nI.B.S. studies, while preliminary and in\nneed of confirmation, hint at something\nfar more significant than the effect of a\nplacebo or problems with a particular\ndrug. They suggest that the “magic bullet”\napproach to health care—simple, effective\nsolutions to single problems, like a strep\ninfection or polio—can no longer remain\nour principal approach to treating disease.\nThere has always been a distinction\nbetween disease and illness. Disease is a\nbiological condition that we have historically\ntreated with drugs, surgery, and\nother technological solutions. Illness, on\nthe other hand, defines the context of a\nmedical encounter, including the relationship\nbetween doctor and patient.\nLike Kaptchuk, Jonas believes that placebo\nresearch demonstrates that it is essential\nto consider both the science and\nthe art of medicine—to think about diseases\nas illnesses, and not to rely solely on\nshort-term, high-tech solutions. Scientists\nhope that, even if it proves impossible\nto replace drugs with placebos, research\ninto the way they affect us will\naccomplish nothing less than a transformation\nof American medicine. “There are\n\n“He’s the chief watchdog, who watches over all the other\nwatchdogs—but this must be his night off.”\nno magic bullets for most of the problems\nthat ail us today,” Jonas said. “Diabetes,\nimmune-system disorders, chronic pain,\ncancer. Our illnesses are complex, and we\nneed to approach them in more comprehensive\nways. We try to identify drugs\nthat will eliminate disease. Yet the way\nwe go about delivering those agents—the\ninteraction between doctor and patient,\nfor example—often has a bigger impact\nthan the agent we focus on. More than\nthe drug and more than the surgery. And\nthat has been collectively called the placebo\neffect.”\nThe headquarters of the Food and\nDrug Administration, situated on\na campus called White Oak, on the far\nedge of Silver Spring, Maryland, seems\nas close to the rest of the federal medical\nestablishment as it is to Pluto. There\nis no Metro to White Oak, and it takes\nhalf an hour to drive from the sprawling\ncampus to the National Institutes of\nHealth, in Bethesda. The F.D.A.’s\nphysical isolation belies its position as\nthe nation’s principal regulator of consumer\nproducts. No drug is sold without\nthe agency’s approval. There will be\nno prescriptions for any placebo, either,\nunless clinical trials have demonstrated\nits effectiveness to the satisfaction of\nthe F.D.A.\n“One of the absolutely fundamental\nproblems that we have is the use of the\n• •\nterm ‘placebo,’ which does nobody any\ngood,” Robert Temple told me, echoing\na complaint made by virtually everyone\nwho deals with the subject. Temple,\nwho has for many years run the F.D.A.’s\ndrug-evaluation department, is an owlish\nman with a short, thick mustache and circular\nglasses. His office is so filled with\ntowering stacks of files that, after you\nenter, it takes a moment to find him. “Just\nbecause something is called a ‘placebo\ngroup,’ ” he said, “everyone assumes that\nwhat happens in that group is a result of\nthe placebo effect. And that is absolutely\nnot true.”\nTemple, who has worked at the\nF.D.A. for four decades, rarely makes a\ndecision without angering somebody. He\nhas been regarded as a meddlesome reactionary\nby H.I.V. activists and others\nwho insist that drugs be released more\nrapidly. The more conservative medical\nestablishment frequently accuses the\nagency of endorsing the wishful thinking\nof drug manufacturers. And to the large\nand growing community that supports\nalternative approaches to medicine Temple\nis Dr. No.\nTemple said that he understands why\nplacebos attract people who become frustrated\nwhen science fails to provide\ndefinitive answers. “The persistence of\nwhat people believe will save their lives as\nopposed to the evidence is staggering,” he\nsaid. “So people are talking about using\nplacebos as drugs. But I have no idea what\nthat means in practical terms. How would\nit work?” Tantalizing hints and possible\neffects are not data, and Temple says there\nare no data that would suggest that placebos\nare drugs. There are several studies,\nthough, that illustrate the basis for his\nskepticism.\nA placebo effect is commonly observed\nduring trials of blood-pressure\nmedications. To qualify for such studies,\nsubjects are supposed to have blood pressure\nthat exceeds a hundred and forty\nover ninety in at least one of the two\nmeasurements. “As soon as somebody\nenters those studies, his or her blood\npressure falls an average of five or six millimetres\nof mercury,” Temple said. “That\nis significant, but it is not a placebo response,\nand it is not a response to being\nin the study. It is often the result of doctors’\ninflating readings—of rounding up.”\nIf a person’s blood pressure is a hundred\nand thirty-eight over eighty-eight, for example,\ninvestigators will often include\nhim. “When you use an automatic bloodpressure\ncuff to establish a baseline for\nthese kinds of studies, the entire placebo\neffect vanishes,” Temple said.\nWhen a drug (or a placebo) is under\nstudy, subjects are usually divided into two\ngroups. Neither group knows exactly what\nit is getting (nor do the doctors), but one\ngroup generally receives the drug and the\nother a placebo. “There is a better way,”\nTemple said. “If you want to see if there is\na placebo effect, use three arms in a drug\ntrial, not two. Tell them, ‘Some of you will\nbe getting a drug, some will get a tablet\nthat looks like a drug but is nothing but a\nsugar pill, and some of you will get nothing\nat all.’\n“It seems to me,” he went on, “that if\nthere is any substantial placebo effect,\nthere ought to be a difference between the\ngroup that knows it’s getting nothing and\nthe group that doesn’t know it’s getting\nnothing. If there is no difference, then\nwhat are we talking about? Because it’s\nnot a placebo effect.”\nIt turns out that there have been many\ntrials of the type Temple mentioned. In\n2001, the Danish epidemiologist AsbjØrn\nHróbjartsson, of Copenhagen’s\nNordic Cochrane Center, along with his\ncolleague Peter GØtzsche, published a\nsystematic review of a hundred and fourteen\nclinical trials that compared patients\nwho received a placebo with subjects who\n34 THE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011\nwere told that they would receive no\nmedicine at all. The researchers attempted\nto assess the combined impact\nof many different kinds of trials using\nmeta-analysis, a statistical technique for\nextracting information from studies that\nare not statistically significant by themselves.\nTheir article, “Is the Placebo Powerless?\nAn Analysis of Clinical Trials\nComparing Placebo with No Treatment,”\npublished in The New England\nJournal of Medicine, was a long-overdue\nresponse to Beecher’s 1955 paper.\nIn almost every case, the researchers reported,\nthere was essentially no difference\nbetween the placebo group and the openly\nuntreated group. There were particular exceptions\nin studies of pain, where there\nwas a slight but measurable placebo effect.\nSince we are physiologically capable of\nmanufacturing our own painkillers—endorphins—the\nresult may not have been\nsurprising. Expectations and suggestion\nclearly influence behavior, and when we\nexpect to receive medicine our bodies\noften begin to prepare for it. (As the evolutionary\nbiologist Robert Trivers recently\npointed out, in “The Folly of Fools,” his\nbook about the historical necessity of deceit,\nwhat the brain expects to happen in\nthe near future affects its physiological\nstate. Trivers’s theory would explain a fact\nthat has often baffled scientists: the placebo\neffect doesn’t appear to work with\nAlzheimer’s patients. Trivers suggests that\nthis is because most people who have Alzheimer’s\ndisease are unable to anticipate\nthe future and are therefore unable to prepare\nfor it.)\nThe Danish researchers repeated the\nstudy in 2004, and again last year, incorporating\nnew data each time. The results\nand their conclusions remained\nthe same. “We found little evidence in\ngeneral that placebos had powerful clinical\neffects,” Hróbjartsson wrote. “Outside\nthe setting of clinical trials, there is\nno justification for the use of placebos.”\nKaptchuk has great respect for Hróbjartsson,\nyet he is wary of relying on\nmeta-analyses, and he believes that an\nhonest interaction between a doctor and\na patient can significantly alter the outcome\nof treatment. That was the point of\nhis study of irritable-bowel syndrome, in\nwhich some subjects were told that they\nwould not be treated. I.B.S., a chronic\ngastrointestinal disorder, is one of the\nmost common reasons that people seek\nmedical care. Effective long-term therapies\nhave proved elusive. In Kaptchuk’s\nstudy, eighty patients were randomly divided\ninto two groups. Patients in the first\ngroup received a placebo pill twice a day;\nthose in the second received nothing. Before\nthe study began, both groups were\ntold that placebos were “inert or inactive\npills, like sugar pills, without any medication\nin them.” They were also informed\nthat placebos have been shown in “rigorous\nclinical testing to produce significant\nmind-body self-healing processes.” Patients\nwho received the openly distributed\nplacebo scored far better on standard assessments\nof their condition than those\nwho received nothing. There were also\nstatistically significant differences in the\nseverity of symptoms.\nAlthough a group of eighty patients is\ntoo small to draw definitive conclusions,\nhonesty seemed to work. “AsbjØrn’s stuff\nis a constant intellectual challenge,” Kaptchuk\nwrote in an e-mail. “His meta-analyses\nare tops. Great methods, very careful.\nClear.” Yet Kaptchuk also pointed out\nthat placebos are not the only interventions\nthat can cause complicated reactions.\nDrugs do, too. Opiods, for example,\nincrease pain in about ten per cent of\nthose who take them. Antibiotics don’t always\nwork, and neither does cortisone, a\npowerful steroid used each year by millions\nof people. Meta-analyses are useful\nto help understand large amounts of data\nfrom different trials. But statistical results\nthat combine information from a\nvariety of medical centers, with\ndifferent kinds of patients, often\nin different countries, administered\nunder different conditions,\ncannot be uniform and therefore\ncannot be conclusive.\nHróbjartsson and Kaptchuk\nare united on at least one front.\nLike Wayne Jonas, they agree\nthat the medical system needs to\nchange. “You have to put this into\nthe context of the society in which\nyou live,” Hróbjartsson told me. “Because\nI think this may be as much a matter of\nphilosophy as of science. There is an antitechnological,\nanti-science feeling in the\nWest. We constantly see frustration with\nthe limits of medicine. The placebo can be\nseen in some sense as a logical avenue for\nthose frustrations. Everyone wants a simple,\npain-free solution. But I wonder if that\napproach isn’t just the mirror image of the\npharmacological way of handling illness—\nthat there is a pill for every disease.\n“The entire idea of a placebo is very\n‘soapy,’ ” Hróbjartsson continued. “It slips\naway whenever you try to find a border.”\nThat has always been true. After all, for\nmany people a placebo is just a sugar pill.\nFor others, the definition includes the entire\nritual of treatment, the complete interaction\nbetween doctor and patient. Increased\nattention has mostly raised new\nquestions: What are the physical and psychological\nmechanisms that produce placebo\neffects? What are the conditions they\nmost easily affect? And can we actually\nidentify people who respond to placebos?\nScientists now have bits of answers to some\nof those questions, but to reach their goal,\nand introduce placebos into clinical practice,\nthey will need to answer all of them.\nTed Kaptchuk gets a great deal of\npleasure from focussing on what\nother people reject. Indifference seems to\nmotivate him. “I was raised in a crazy\nhome, and it prepared me to accept any\nproposition,” he said. That, he once told\nme, is why he was so active in the sixties:\n“It was a time when the underpinnings of\nthe universe were questioned.” Both of\nKaptchuk’s parents, who were Poles, survived\nthe Holocaust. “That really defines\na lot of what I do. My father was a Red,\nso I have a tendency to get pleasure from\nsubversiveness.”\nA particularly radical son of the sixties,\nKaptchuk was one of the\nfounders of the Columbia University\nchapter of Students for\na Democratic Society, in 1965,\nbut the organization was soon\ndominated by a faction that became\nthe Weather Underground.\nThat was too radical\neven for Kaptchuk. He fled to\nthe West Coast. “I was hanging\nout with the San Francisco Red\nGuards and reading Mao, trying\nto get away from U.S. imperialism,”\nhe said. “I was militant and crazy.\nBut at some point I said, Ted, this is not\nbeing human.”\nKaptchuk decided to pursue studies in\nChinese philosophy and medicine at the\nsource. Beijing had yet to open its borders\nto Americans, but Kaptchuk hoped\nthat his revolutionary bona fides would\nprompt the leadership to make an exception.\n“My request to study there was de-\nTHE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011 35\nlivered to the government by members of\nthe Black Panther Party,” he told me.\nEven that didn’t work. The Chinese denied\nthe request, and Kaptchuk spent\nmuch of the next decade studying in\nMacau.\nToday, it is hard to imagine Ted\nKaptchuk as a radical, let alone a fugitive.\nHe is an observant Jew who wears a yarmulke\non top of a shaggy bowl haircut\nthat looks as if he’d copied the Beatles,\ncirca 1964, then let it grow. As a devotee\nof Eastern thought, he bars shoes from\nhis house and speaks in a hushed, measured\nvoice. David Carradine would have\nplayed him beautifully.\nKaptchuk is the first prominent professor\nat Harvard Medical School since\nErik Erikson with neither a medical degree\nnor a doctorate, and it would be easy\nto dismiss him as a signature representative\nof the unsubstantiated-alternativehealth-care\nmovement. But he has published\nscores of books, articles in highly\nregarded peer-reviewed journals, letters,\nand review notes—on subjects ranging\nfrom placebo research to exorcism, from\ncancer treatment to shaman rituals among\nNavajo Indians. He has just finished a\nstudy designed to answer a central question\nin placebo research: Do the genes of\npeople who respond to placebos differ in\nsignificant ways from those of people\nwho don’t? (The data, compelling but so\nfar preliminary, suggest that the answer\nis yes.)\n“Ted Kaptchuk is the most knowledgeable\nperson in the world on all matters\nplacebo,” Franklin Miller told me.\nMiller is a senior faculty member in the\nDepartment of Bioethics at the National\nInstitutes of Health. “He has done the\nresearch, the scholarship, and the most\ninteresting and clinically relevant studies.”\nOne day, I asked Kaptchuk how a\nman who practiced acupuncture and dispensed\nherbs, rather than earning a\nPh.D. in biology or statistics, had learned\nto design complicated trials. He told me\nthat he spent years seeking the advice of\nthe most highly respected and rigorous\nmedical statisticians. “I basically apprenticed\nmyself,” he said, “and they were\nhappy to help a quack who wanted to\ndeal with data.”\nKaptchuk is proud of being what he\ncalls “a card-carrying member of the\nHarvard establishment.” It is a distinction\nthat did not come easily, even\nthough he has received millions of dollars\nin funding for his projects from the\nNational Institutes of Health. “The goal\nis to understand placebos so that they\nmay be used intelligently,” he said one\nday. “But this is the area where I veer\nfrom some of my colleagues. Because\nwhat do I really want? Anything that\ngets people away from the conveyor belts\nthat move from the pharmaceutical\nhouses to doctors and on to patients is\nworth considering. Anything. We need\nto stop pretending it’s all about molecular\nbiology. Serious illnesses are affected\nby aesthetics, by art, and by the moral\nquestions that are negotiated between\npractitioners and patients. Chiropractors\nnever say that your pain is all in your\nhead. But orthopedists do it all the time.\nWhat a fucking way to try and help\nsomebody heal. Do you know how evil\nthat is?”\nThat kind of deeply held conviction\ntouches on the fundamental questions\nthat challenge American medicine.\nKaptchuk wants to broaden the definition\nof healing, which is exactly what\nenrages many scientists. In one recent\nstudy of a major asthma drug, he and his\ncolleagues reported that, although placebos\nhad no impact on the chemical\nmarkers that indicate whether a patient\nis responding to therapy, patients nonetheless\nreported feeling better. Kaptchuk\nconcluded that objective data should not\nbe the only criterion for doctors to consider.\n“Even though objective physiological\nmeasures are important,” he wrote in\nthe study, published earlier this year in\nThe New England Journal of Medicine,\n“other outcomes such as emergency\nroom visits and quality-of-life metrics\nmay be more clinically relevant to patients\nand physicians.”\n“My jaw dropped when I read this,”\nDavid Gorski, a professor of medicine at\nWayne State University School of Medicine,\nwrote on the science blog Respectful\nInsolence. “ ‘Other outcomes’\nbesides objective measures of disease severity\nmay be ‘more clinically relevant’?”\nThat kind of assertion clashes with the\nbasic truths of the scientific method.\nKaptchuk counters that we are losing\nsight of our goal—which is to make\npeople feel better. “This study demonstrated\nthat, without a change in objective\ndata, you still get incredible subjective\nimprovement,” he said. “So is a\ndoctor really supposed to say, Gee, the\npatient is feeling good but I better ignore\nthat and go by the numbers?”\nIt was late in the afternoon, and we\nwere sitting in Kaptchuk’s garden in\nCambridge. He looked at me and threw\nhis hands into the air. “Is my approach\njust hocus-pocus?” he said softly. “Isn’t\nthat what you are really asking? You want\nto know the relationship between rationality\nand feeling and between science,\ncritical thinking, and the art of medicine.\nAnd that boils down to one question: Do\nyou think this entire field is based on a\nfoundation of magical thinking, or do\nyou not?”\nThree years ago, a week before\nThanksgiving, while I was sitting in\nmy office, my chest began to throb. It\nwas a diffuse pain, but pain nonetheless.\nI am a middle-aged man with the usual\namount of stress (too much) and I handle\nit in the usual way (denial). My cholesterol\nand blood pressure are normal,\nand I exercise regularly and try to eat sensibly.\nStill, I have read many obituaries of\n“healthy” men my age who ignored chest\npain. So, somewhat sheepishly, I called\nmy doctor and explained the situation,\nand he told me to come right over.\nHe conducted a thorough examination,\nand then we talked. He told me I\nwas fine, that Thanksgiving is often a\ntense time, and that I should relax. My\npain suddenly disappeared. I have written\nfrequently of my belief that magic\nis for fairy tales and science is for humans.\nBut something about that process\nsoothed me. Of course, it was a relief to\nknow that I wasn’t sick. But could words\nreally banish a pain I had struggled with\nfor hours?\nAfter I got home, I realized that I had\nbeen given a placebo. Not purposefully,\nperhaps, but it had the same effect. My\ndoctor told me that I was fine, and that\nmade my pain go away. It also eased my\nanxiety at least as effectively as if I had\nswallowed a pill. My doctor takes an extremely\nscience-based approach to his\nwork. That’s what makes him so good at\nhis job. But that afternoon we engaged in\nexactly the type of ritual that, according\nto Kaptchuk, will have to play a critical\nrole in the future of American health\ncare. And, at least in this instance, it\nwould have been hard to argue that it\ndidn’t work. apple\n36 THE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011",
