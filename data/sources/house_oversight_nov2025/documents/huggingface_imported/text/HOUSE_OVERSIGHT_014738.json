  "text": "2. Learning from Japanese fiscal stimulus\n\nUltimately, fiscal stimulus is not the long-term answer to flat curves or low neutral rates\nQapan being the prime example). Fiscal stimulus merely captures some low-hanging fruit\nthat extends the business cycle by a couple of years and provides the central bank an\nopportunity to get further away from the ZLB. Said simply, fiscal stimulus raises the\nterminal rate in the current business cycle while doing little for the long-run neutral rate\n— this by definition should be more bearish for intermediate rates than 30y rates.\n\n3. Additional deficit issuance\n\nWith the average maturity of UST debt already standing at record highs (7Omonths),\nTreasury showing an inclination to cut long-end issue sizes in 2016, and the supply\nshortfall in the front end of the UST curve post MMF reform, we also believe that the\nUS Treasury will finance the increased deficit using the belly of the UST curve as\nopposed to the long end\n\nTrade: We recommend a 3m5y OTM payer 25 delta, strike = 2.05% for a gross\npayoff ratio of 3.4: 1. See the Best Vol Trades section for more details and risks.\n\nBut focus on being short real rates now\n\nAfter spending much of 2016 successfully being long real rates, we recommend\nswitching to a real rate short for 2017. We think the consensus was too slow to get on\nthe real rate train and is now too long relative to benchmark. As described in the detail\nhere, fiscal stimulus is likely to leave government and private companies competing for\na shrinking pool of savings, driving the real cost of debt higher. We highlight three\nreasons why short real rates provides better risk-reward now (Chart 15).\n\n¢ Anti-globalization = higher real rates: Few appreciate that one of the biggest\nbeneficiaries of globalization has been US real rates. Globalization was undoubtedly\ngood for EM growth and reserves. As these reserves found their way back into the\nUS, US real interest rates were held lower. As the global savings glut unwinds, real\nrates have the most room to re-price. Chart 16 offers compelling proof.\n\n« _ Risk parity unwind = higher real rates: Exposure to any heightened concern about\na risk parity deleveraging trade in a high vol environment is best found in asset\nclasses where their footprint is large relative to market liquidity. TIPS is a prime\nexample of one such asset class. The influence of a multi-asset strategy on real\nrates is clear from Chart 17.\n\n- Lower rates = lower breakevens: If the recent euphoria unwinds, it is likely due to\na1) RMB deval; 2} commodity collapse post OPEC; or 3) equity market correction.\n\nChart 15: Real rates vs. breakevens: A real Chart 16: Foreign official holdings of UST vs. Chart 17: BAML multi asset strategy index vs\nshort offers better risk reward than nominal real rates real rates\nshort\n600 -1.25 590 -0.2\n2 0.8\n400 0.75 580 0\n1.8 570 0.2\n0.3 Le\n200 0.25 560 04\n02 0 0.25 550 0.6\n14 -200 - 0.75 540 0.8\n1.2 af 400 1.25 a a\n10 11 12 13 14 15 16 ¢ ® ¢ & ¢ & ¢\n: 12 58282438\nWw wo wo wo co co co ice}\npe ae === 6m change in foreign official holdings of USTs\n—— 5y5y breakevens (LHS) === 6m change in 30y real rates (RHS, inverted == USGGT10Y Index (R1)\n5y5 | rates scale, %4)\nyoy real ra Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, US Treasury The BAML multi asset strategy index is not representative of all\n\nisk-parity funds.
