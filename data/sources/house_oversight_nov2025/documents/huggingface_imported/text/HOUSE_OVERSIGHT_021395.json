  "text": "at once both individual and social.\nBecause both individuality and sociality\nare fundamental to the human species,\nwe are fundamentally interdependent,\nconnected by invisible, yet powerful,\nthreads. In exploring these threads, we\nhave also been led to questions about\nhow social forces can have effects on\nindividuals, how the meaning that\nindividuals (and groups) apply to\nparticular phenomena or relationships\naffect both behavior and biology, and\nhow our biology makes social\nconnection possible. We have used the\nphrase “invisible forces” to describe the\nmechanisms that account for these\neffects that we essentially take for\ngranted, and to suggest by analogy that\nthey can be investigated rigorously just\nas other phenomena, such as gravity or\nautonomic regulation, that also are not\nimmediately present to our visual or\nother senses can be studied.\n\nHuman minds are unparalleled at\ndiscerning patterns in what they see\nagainst a background of noise and\nvariation, and they are equally adept at\nattributing meaning to them. As the\nessays in this volume demonstrate\nrepeatedly, we readily ascribe patterns\nwe encounter (or seek to encounter) to\ninvisible forces of nature, of God, of\nkinship, of genes, of culture, of love, of\nsocial connection. A common premise\nunderlying the work of the network is\nthat what we know (or what we think we\nknow), and how we come to know it, are\nsocial endeavors embedded in a shared\nview of both the world and how one\ntalks meaningfully about the world. And\nmindful of our human facility to see\npatterns (even where none exist!), we are\nacutely aware that constant rigorous\ntesting of assumptions, methods, and\narguments is necessary to make sure that\n\n149\n\nPage\n\nwe are not fooling ourselves into seeing\nonly what we hope to see.\n\nHumans have a deep need to\ncreate meaning in their interactions with\nthe world and with each other. We also\nhave a deep need for making\nconnections beyond ourselves. The\nbiological structure we call our brain has\nevolved to reward social connection, just\nas it rewards the satisfaction of hunger\nor thirst. The human biology that directs\nand reflects these human needs is what\nwe have termed the “social brain.”\n\nIt is worthwhile to reflect on the\nrange of invisible forces that we have\nconsidered here. These forces operate at\nseveral different levels, from the\nmolecular, to individual bodily\nfunctions, to social groups, to societies,\nto species. They include such disparate\nideas as evolutionary selective pressure\nfavoring social connectedness,\nanthropomorphism, loneliness, social\nconnection, emergent phenomena,\nconnection to a higher being,\ntranscendence, empathy, language as\ncarrier for meaning, belief, collective\nwill, group synchrony, autonomic\nregulation, and neural resonance. These\nforces interact with one another, too:\nloneliness, for instance, acting as an\ninternal signal of the inadequacy of\none’s bonds of social connection, with\nconsequent effects on health, mediated\nthrough autonomic regulation, or the role\nof belief in mediating scientific\nobjectivity and empathy.\n\nIt is tempting to view individuals,\nboth souls and bodies, as arising from\nlower-level forces within, such as the\noperation of specialized neurons and\nregulatory biological processes. And it\nis tempting to view social structures and\nthe forces that tend to maintain them as\narising, perhaps emergently, from the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021395",
