A VC-25A can also be\nrefuelled in mid-air by a tanker, extending its range even further.\n\nThe two presidential planes cost $325 million each and their cost of operation\ncomes to $179,750 per hour. The hourly cost of operation for a standard 757\nis just over $8,000 by comparison, though the taxpayer will pick up the higher\nbill for Air Force One. All that bling certainly inflated the cost of Trump Force\nOne but Air Force One is expensive because it’s packed with equipment and\nfacilities to keep the president and his or her entourage safe at all times.\nThere is a hospital onboard, electronic countermeasures and heavy shielding\nto afford protection in the event of an electromagnetic pulse during a nuclear\nattack. All in all, if Trump does end up travelling regularly on Air Force One,\nhe probably won't regret trading in his gold seatbelt buckle for the presidential\nsuite on one of the most sophisticated airliners in the world.\n\nhttps://www.statista.com/chart/51 10/trump-force-one-vs-air-force-one/\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033302",
