  "text": "Enter Assange | 101\n\ndeparture from the position Snowden had taken in his postings on\nthe Ars Technica site in January 2009. He complained in a post there\nabout the detrimental consequences to U.S. intelligence of leakers’\nrevealing “classified shit” to The New York Times, and he suggested\nas punishment “those people should be shot in the balls.” Either he\nhad a change of heart, or he was telling Assange what he believed he\nwanted to hear.\n\nAssange counseled Snowden to go directly to Russia. “My advice\nwas that he should take asylum in Russia despite the negative PR\nconsequences,” he told the London Times in 2015. He said, “Snowden\nwas well aware of the spin that would be put on it if he took asylum\nin Russia.” So a story would be released presumably by WikiLeaks,\ncoinciding with his departure, asserting that Snowden was “bound\nfor the republic of Ecuador via a safe route.” When Snowden asked\nhow he would carry out the plan, Assange told him that he would\nimmediately dispatch one of his senior staff members to help him\nengineer his escape to Russia. That senior staff member was Sarah\nHarrison.\n\n© After speaking to Snowden, Assange called Harrison, who was in ©\nMelbourne. She had gone there a month earlier to help organize\nAssange’s somewhat quixotic election campaign for president of\nAustralia. Assange told her to forget the campaign and go to Hong\nKong.

Harrison later said that she didn’t\neven bother to pack her clothing after hearing from Assange. She\ncaught the next plane to Hong Kong and arrived there on June 11—\nthe same day that Snowden texted Greenwald he was in a safe house\nand before Snowden’s explosive interview with Lam. Harrison had\nher own connections in Hong Kong. Her two younger sisters, Kate\nand Alexandra, lived there and were part of the expatriate commu-\nnity. She also had an older brother, Simon, who headed Avra, a ship\nbrokerage and commodity trading company, headquartered in Sin-\ngapore, but he frequently traveled to Hong Kong on business.\n\nLike Poitras, Sarah Harrison took great care to shield her move-\nments. She did not have a Twitter, Facebook, or any other social media\naccount.
