  "text": "doing the raping? Oh, okay, sorry about that. | didn’ t know, | had to ask. |\nhave to tell you, though, as far as campaign slogans go: Donald Trump\n2016--Who’ s Doing the Raping?” Hey, it sounds familiar already.\n\nkok *\n\nAlthough Daniel Tosh is a consistently unapologetic performer for\nthe sardonic material he exudes on his Comedy Central series--which\nfeatures a running theme of rape jokes, even including one about his sister--\nfor this occasion he decided to go the Twitter route: “All the out of\ncontext misquotes aside, |’ d like to sincerely apologize.” He also\ntweeted, “The point | was making before | was heckled is there are awful\nthings in the world but you can still make jokes about them.”\n\nAccording to Jamie Masada, owner of the Laugh Factory, Tosh asked\nthe audience, “What you guys wanna talk about?” Someone called out\n\n“Rape,” and a woman in the audience started screaming, “No, rape is\npainful, don’ t talk about it.”. Then, says Masada, “Daniel came in, and\nhe said, ‘Well, it sounds like she’ s been raped by five\nguys’ —something like that. | didn’ t hear properly. It was a comment—it\nwasn’ t a joke at the expense of this girl.” Masada claims that she sat\nthrough the rest of Tosh’ s performance, which received a standing\n\novation, before she complained to the manager.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019096",
