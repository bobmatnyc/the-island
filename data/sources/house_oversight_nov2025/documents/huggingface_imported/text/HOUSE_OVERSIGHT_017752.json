Rev. 835, #899\n\nrelated parts of the presentence report; without such access they are unable to effectively make their sentencing\nrecommendation.\n\nIn view of that legal landscape, there are three ways in which the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure might deal with\ndisclosure of the presentence reports to victims:\n\n(1) Complete Disclosure. The rules could direct full disclosure of the presentence report to the victim. While no statute bars this\napproach, legitimate policy objections might be raised. Some reports may contain sensitive private information about the\ndefendant such as results of psychiatric examinations, prior history of drug use, or childhood sexual abuse. Some reports may\nalso reveal confidential law enforcement information that should not be widely circulated. Victims may not always need access\n\nrt, 269\n\nto these parts of the report. While a number of states give victims unfettered right to access the presentence repo a more\n\nlimited approach seems appropriate in the federal system.\n\n[*900] (2) Selective Disclosure. The rules could direct that the probation office redact any presentence report to remove\nconfidential information and then provide the redacted report to the victim. This approach, too, is problematic; it would require\nconsiderable work by busy probation officers to prepare an additional document - a redacted report - presumably only after\nconsulting with the attorneys on both sides of the case about what might be viewed as confidential.\n\n(3) Disclosure through Prosecutors. The simplest solution to the competing concerns is to disclose the report to victims through\nan intermediary: the prosecutor. The prosecutor would serve as the filter for confidential information and assist the victim by\nhighlighting critical parts of the report. Opponents might object that this approach would burden prosecutors, who are no less\n\n270\n\nbusy than probation officers. But the CVRA already gives victims the right to \"confer\" with prosecutors, and presumably\n\nthey will confer regarding the important topic of sentencing. Moreover, many U.S. Attorney's Offices already have Victim-\nWitness Coordinators who communicate with victims regarding impact statements. The CVRA also authorizes increased\n\nfunding of $ 22 million for the Victim-Witness Assistance Programs in U.S. Attorney's Offices, presumably enabling those\n\noffices to expand their victim services. 77!\n\nIt might be burdensome to require that prosecutors disclose presentence reports to victims in all cases, even when they are not\ninterested in such disclosure. Accordingly, disclosure of the report should be required only upon request of a victim.\n\nFor all those reasons, the Commission should amend the rules to give requesting victims access to presentence reports through\nthe prosecutor. In addition, some of the aspects of preparing and disclosing presentence reports are covered in Chapter 6.A of\nthe United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. *’? The Manual falls within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Sentencing\nCommission. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules should [*901] coordinate with the Commission to\nensure that any changes in the Criminal Rules are consistent with the provisions of the Manual.\n\nRule 32(f), (h), (i) - Victim Opportunity To Object to Presentence Report\n\nThe Proposal:\n\nRule 32(f), (h), and (i) should be amended to allow the victim to object to the presentence report as follows:\n(f) Objecting to the Report.\n\n(1) Time To Object. Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections,\nincluding objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from\nthe report. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall raise for the victim any reasonable objection by the victim to\nthe presentence report.\n\n269 See supra note 255.\n\n270 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(5) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n271 See 118 Stat. 2260, 2264 (2004).\n\n272 See supra note 257 and accompanying text.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017752",
