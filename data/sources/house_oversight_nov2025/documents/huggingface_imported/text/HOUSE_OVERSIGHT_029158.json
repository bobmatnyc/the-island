  "text": "2— His suggestion that chimpanzee dominance hierarchies consist of a version of\npsychopathy is utterly novel to me and most interesting. I had always thought of\ndominance hierarchies as being associated with tyranny and despotism—but are\nthese not often associated with psychopathy?!\n\n“NEAR FIXATION”—SEZ WHO? OH YOU AND YOUR STUDENTS—NOW THAT'S A\nSURPRISE.\n\nConsider the “Butcher of Bagdad” Saddam Hussein or the sadistic Basir Assad. The\nonly thing they didn’t do is specialize in rape, although Saddam’s son Uday did and\nwe can be sure each had greater than average reproductive success but note how\nsensitive each is to degree of relatedness writ large. Saddam was most biased\ntoward people that came from his place of birth, along the Tigrit River, then people\nin the surrounding province and then Sunnis over Shia.\n\nSince he was willing to kill others on a large scale—200,000 Shia slaughtered when\nthe idiotic first Bush allowed Saddam to retain his Airforce after we had marched to\nBagdad after flinging Saddam’s troops out of Kuwait. Or for that matter, Saddam’s\nattack on Shia Iran which claimed more than a million lives on both sides.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029158",
