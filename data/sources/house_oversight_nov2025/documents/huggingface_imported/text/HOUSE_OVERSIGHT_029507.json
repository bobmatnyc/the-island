  "text": "we now know, there was an entirely parallel effort to influence American foreign policy, and\nGeorge Nader was at the center of it.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, Nader and Elliott Broidy pitched a scheme to the\ngovernments of the UAE and Saudi Arabia in which Broidy would use his extensive\ncontacts in Washington, especially in the White House, to shape U.S. policy toward Qatar,\nwhich the Saudis and Emiratis accuse of supporting the Muslim Brotherhood, funding\nextremism, and cozying up to Iran. Apparently, the Emiratis agreed to the arrangement.\nClearly, putting the screws to Qatar’s Emir Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani is a high priority for\nthe crown princes of Saudi Arabia and Abu Dhabi, who undoubtedly would not apologize\nfor using every method and resource at their disposal to advance their countries’ interests.\nWhat is the Trump administration’s excuse, though?\n\nThe kind of influence-peddling in which Nader and Broidy were involved can be traced back\nto Jared Kushner. On Nov. 8, 2016, if not before, he was handing out his cellphone number\nto all kinds of people in Washington with little regard for the potential consequences and\napparently little idea about who was genuinely powerful and who were just posers. No doubt\nthat important people in certain countries had the mobile numbers of senior members of the\nObama administration, plus their Gmail addresses, but there was something qualitatively\ndifferent about the way Kushner was operating. He was essentially opening the door to a\nTrumpian culture in which there is no process, there is no vetting, everyone and anyone\ncould be an asset, loyalty is the greatest quality second only to money, and there are always\nways to get something done no matter what.\n\nTrump’s world does not operate the same way as Washington’s major Middle Eastern allies,\nbut there are some parallels that make stories like the George Nader affair possible. Trump’s\ntendency to eschew the formal processes and procedures of government dovetails with the\nway in informal power, uncodified norms, and past practices shape governance and policy in\nplaces as diverse as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Egypt, and Israel. These kinds of informal\ninstitutions exist in the United States as well; a lot of things have gotten done in Washington\nover the years because of the Harvard “old boys’” network or because that’s the way it has\nalways been done in the cloakroom. But informal networking has generally not guided the\nrealm of foreign policy, which has always involved an exhaustive (and exhausting)\ninteragency process. Kushner’s willingness to hand out his digits signaled that Team Trump\nwas open to doing things significantly differently from previous administrations, and U.S.\nallies along with people like Nader and Broidy took him up on it. The result was a $650\nmillion contract for Broidy’s security firm after he bent the ear of the president and others\nabout the perfidy of the Qatari leadership.\n\nFrom the vantage point of Middle Eastern capitals, in Trump’s Washington, the secretary of\nstate and the national security advisor are superfluous. You could go through Kushner or\nsupplement by engaging in some “riyalpolitik.” The influence business has been around\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029507",
