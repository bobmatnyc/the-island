  "text": "early on I told you I thought Tom remarkably careless . Eilleen goofy and your art lawyer not well\ninformed to say the least. you told me Tom was a senior partner. Eileen had headed the trading desk , and\nRalph Lerner had to know what he was doing as he wrote the book. . I said I thought you deserved\nbetter ,should get better people and no , Iam not an HR person. yesterday you told me that the reason\nyou have hired whomver you could find was to avoid being dependent on me. a decision by far , not the\nbest place to try to save money )\n\nJoslin- who you say I hired . I neither found nor hired. With a two person given choice I approved joslin\nover some woman that eileen preferred. against my repeated advice you and eileen decided the pay range\nat under 300k . I told you at that time that I would personally pay the difference for a higher quality\nperson, that was years ago . I have sent over a hundred emails to you clearly saying he needs to be\nclosely managed by better professionals. initially , that referred to Eillen and Ada.and after, brad. john\netc. THere are many emails each and every month from me, telling you , he is slipping failing cracking\nfragile. . crazy, nuts, heading towards incompetence. Unless YOU- TAKE ACTION! when I pressured\nhim for accurate numbers , you told him, to tell me, that he works for you and NOT for me. . When I\ncontinued to press for accuracy from your office , you told me that they were now all afraid of me and 1\nshould let brad communicate any requests, ( you now tell me \" we know what Brad is\"?). When I told you\nyou office needs to be reviewed and changed you told me 1 was being destructive rather than\nconstructive. when i ultimately confronted joslin, in an attempt to protect you, told him that his numbers\nwere wildly inaccurate , you told me that i had caused his ultimate resignation and now have an\naffirmative obligation to fill in the resultant gap.\n\nI did give you a bad number , and apologized as soon as i realized it. an error that was an embarrassment\nforme, the fact that that the accurate number is still way below what you agreed to pay , has fallen by\nthe wayside.( the preposterous argument that the end of year transaction was Alans idea , which you now\nknow was not true and that me not receiving Phaidon documents was unexplainable. was your justification\nthough, for non - full payment )\n\nHopefully You will recall that when you initially asked for my help. I declined repeatedly with the\nadmonition that that having a financial arrangement is fraught with danger and could complitcate our\nfriendship (as you will be unhappy paying what you will view as a large sum. while choosing to ignore\nthe financial benefits, ). In Bedford , I repeated my concern. THe current circumstance is distressing to\nme, Ihave done my utmost to keep you safe. and will continue to do so. reckless choices in\naccounting or otherwise does not bode well. at each turn I have put your interests first , including in some\ninstances attempting to fight your choices.\nyour current circumstance needs nuanced attention. as you know, there are a few areas with very serious\nconsequences. whether it be , having Ada , form grats without review, brad doing phaidon without\nreview. payments make without review.merely in order to be weaned , is one more high risk choice.\nreview of outside accounting firms , CANNOT be done by brad. to have your accounting dept sit in on\nAlans trust accounting lecture . in order to learn the filed is reminiscent of elieen reading the tax regs. (\nshe also was going to take a course)\n\nI am here in New York today. should you like to resume\n\nDate: Mon, May 2, 2016 at 12:51 AM\nSubject: Fwd: Valuation Discount\nTo: Melanie Spinella\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023236",
