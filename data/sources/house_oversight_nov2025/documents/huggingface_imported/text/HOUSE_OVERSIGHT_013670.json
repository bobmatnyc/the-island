This large, round, many windows and black\nboards, study with a small upstairs bedroom was one of the apartments for visiting\nprofessors behind the Warwick Mathematics Institute in the English Midlands. |\nattended a variety of churches and synagogues on the weekends. The perspective\nthat emerged for me at Warwick was that rabbinic Haggadah, inferences to be\ndrawn from imaginatively spawned narrative, isn’t the same thing as Halakhah, the\nlaw dictated by Jewish legal tradition; that geometric insight and other intuitions\naren’t the same as mathematical proofs; that the mystical visions of the English\nromantic poet and illustrator, William Blake, were not necessarily consistent with the\nscientific observations and logical arguments of the contemporary Scottish\nphilosopher, David Hume.
