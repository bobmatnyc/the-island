  "text": "have no New York trustees, no property located in New York, and no New York-source income).\nSecond, the bill would eliminate a “loophole” that allows so-called incomplete gift, non-grantor trusts\n(“INGs” or “DINGs,” if the trusts are created in Delaware) to completely avoid New York income tax; it\nwould do so by making the trust a “grantor trust” for New York income tax purposes — meaning that the\ncreator of the trust would be taxable on the trust’s income for New York purposes, even though the\ncreator is not taxable on that income for federal purposes. Although these proposals would be\nretroactive to January 1, 2014 if enacted, some transition rules would apply: accumulation distributions\npaid before June 1, 2014 would be exempt, and the ING rules would not apply to income from a trust\nthat is liquidated before June 1, 2014.\n\nComments. This proposed legislation reflects recommendations from the Trusts and Estates section of\nthe New York Bar Association that were included in the November 2013 report from the Tax Reform and\nFairness Commission. According to the bill's supporting memorandum, the provisions would increase\ntax revenues by $75 million in fiscal year 2014-15, $225 million in fiscal year 2015-16, and $150 million\nannually thereafter. In other words, these proposals are perceived as money-makers. Yet whether that\nwould indeed be the case remains to be seen: wealthy New Yorkers seem unlikely to view these\nchanges as “improvements” to the taxation of trusts, but rather, as another reason to move out of New\nYork.\n\nJanuary and February 7520 rates issued\n\nThe IRS has issued the January and February 2014 applicable federal rates: the January 7520 rate is 2.2%,\nan increase of 0.20% (20 basis points) from December’s 2.0% rate.
