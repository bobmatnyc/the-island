  "text": "15\n\nadmonition to “break and control the violence of faction” through a\n“well-constructed Union.”\n\nRight now factionalism leaves critical budget challenges unmet, stops\nserious investment in education and research, and leaves America\ntrailing China on the green technologies that will be big job-creators\nin coming decades. The road to the American future is not “Drill,\nBaby, Drill!”\n\nThird, it’s just delusional to imagine that any president, Republican\nor Democrat, confronted by the meltdown of 2008, would not have\nseen as a core task a retrenchment of U.S. overseas commitments in\nan attempt to bring them in line with diminished resources.\n\nBut with an angry, anxious nation, Republicans are betting that\ninvocations of greatness and dominance, however illusory, will\nresonate. Bruce Jentleson, a political scientist at Duke University,\nsaid, “After the killing of Osama bin Laden, they can’t attack Obama\nas a wimp, but they will attack him as not being a real American.”\nObama, he added, must answer by demonstrating “what this\ngeneration of Americans is going to show the world, how it’s going\nto compete in a global era. Against the illusion of restoration, he must\noffer adaptation.”\n\nWith the U.S. economy wobbling, Obama runs the Bush Sr. risk. He\ngot Bin Laden and has been on the right side of the Arab Spring —\nwhat Timothy Garton Ash has called “the most hopeful set of events\nin the 21st century so far, comparable in scale and potential to 1989.”\nAmericans respond to that kind of hope. They care about foreign\npolicy and see through foreign posturing. What they need now from\nObama is a better sense of how their economy can thrive in this\nchanged world.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018099",
