But he insisted it was all a part of election\ncampaign contributions.\n\nPublicly, I reserved judgement. “I hope, for everyone’s sake, and for Prime\nMinister Olmert’s sake, that the suspicions now circulating turn out to be\nbaseless,” I told a reporter. “Let’s be patient.” Privately, I urged him to take a leave\nof absence and clear his name. Yet with other ministers convinced that would\nmake things worse, I held off doing anything else until there seemed to me no\nchoice, after Talansky gave evidence in Jerusalem’s District Court. Though he\ngenuinely seemed not to have expected anything specific in return, he said he had\ngiven Olmert something like $150,000 in cash. I called a news conference the next\nday. I didn’t say whether or not I thought Olmert was guilty. I did say that I\nbelieved he couldn’t continue leading the country while resolving his “personal\nmatters”. Things finally came to ahead in September 2008. When Kadima held\nfresh leadership elections, Tzipi Livni won. Olmert confirmed he would step aside\nfor his successor. But under Israeli law, he would remain Prime Minister until she\neither succeeded in forming a new government or called early elections. She opted\nin the end for Option B, and the election was set for February 2009.\n\nThat meant Olmert would still be Prime Minister for another three months.\nWe’d long been discussing the increasingly worrying situation in Gaza. After Arik\npulled out, an election had placed Hamas in power, after which the Islamists\nembarked on a violent purge of Fatah loyalists. Arms smuggling through tunnels\nfrom the Sinai had become rife. Rockets from Gaza were now landing on southern\nIsrael. Hundreds of thousands of Israelis were living with the reality of a warning\nsiren and a rapid dash into their shelters. For a while, amid negotiations through\nEgypt to end the rocket fire, we limited ourselves to sending small ground units\ninto Gaza to target the source of specific rocket attacks. But that was always going\nto have only a limited effect. It also ran the risk of our soldiers being abducted, or\nkilled.\n\nPressure was building for a major military operation. With the election drawing\nnearer, Bibi Netanyahu was reminding voters that he’d been against the pullout\nfrom Gaza, and saying that we should now hit Hamas hard. Both Olmert and Tzipi,\nalong with most of the cabinet, were also in favor of doing so. But my long-held\nview, reinforced by the recent war against Hizbollah in Lebanon, was that we had\nto begin by deciding what we wanted to accomplish, and what was possible. Only\nthen could we take action. I told the cabinet that, operationally, we were perfectly\n\n405\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011876",
