A “manipulatives center,” for ex-\nample, provides physical objects such as drawing implements, toys and puzzles, to facilitate\ndevelopment of motor manipulation, visual discrimination, and (through sequencing and clas-\nsification games) basic logical reasoning. A “dramatics center,” on the other hand, cross-trains\ninterpersonal and empathetic skills along with bodily-kinesthetic, linguistic, and musical skills.\nOther centers, such as art, reading, writing, science and math centers are also designed to train\nnot just one area, but to center around a primary intelligence type while also cross-developing\nrelated areas. For specific examples of the learning centers associated with particular contem-\nporary preschools, see [Nie98].\n\nIn many progressive, student-centered preschools, students are left largely to their own de-\nvices to move from one center to another throughout the preschool room. Generally, each center\nwill be staffed by an instructor at some points in the day but not others, providing a variety\nof learning experiences. At some preschools students will be strongly encouraged to distribute\ntheir time relatively evenly among the different learning centers, or to focus on those learning\ncenters corresponding to their particular strengths and/or weaknesses.\n\nTo imitate the general character of a human preschool, one would create several centers in\na robot lab or virtual world. The precise architecture will best be adapted via experience but\ninitial centers would likely be:\n\ne a blocks center: a table with blocks on it\n\ne a language center: a circle of chairs, intended for people to sit around and talk with the\nrobot\n\n® a manipulatives center: with a variety of different objects of different shapes and sizes,\nintended to teach visual and motor skills\n\ne a ball play center: where balls are kept in chests and there is space for the robot to kick\nthe balls around\n\ne a dramatics center: where the robot can observe and enact various movements\n\n16.3 Elements of Preschool Curriculum\n\nWhile preschool curricula vary considerably based on educational philosophy and regional and\ncultural factors, there is a great deal of common, shared wisdom regarding the most useful topics\nand methods for preschool teaching. Guided experiential learning in diverse environments and\nusing varied materials is generally agreed upon as being an optimal methodology to reach a wide\nvariety of learning types and capabilities. Hands-on learning provides grounding in specifics,\nwhere as a diversity of approaches allows for generalization.\n\nCore knowledge domains are also relatively consistent, even across various philosophies\nand regions. Language, movement and coordination, autonomous judgment, social skills, work\nhabits, temporal orientation, spatial orientation, mathematics, science, music, visual arts, and\ndramatics are universal areas of learning which all early childhood learning touches upon. The\nparticulars of these skills may vary, but all human children are taught to function in these do-\nmains. The level of competency developed may vary, but general domain knowledge is provided.\nFor example, most kids won’t be the next Maria Callas, Ravi Shankar or Gene Ween, but nearly\nall learn to hear, understand and appreciate music.\n\nTables 16.1 - 16.3 review the key capabilities taught in preschools, and identify the most\nimportant specific skills that need to be evaluated in the context of each capability.
