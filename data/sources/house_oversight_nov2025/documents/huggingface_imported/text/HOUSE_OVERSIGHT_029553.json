He has been travelling, speaking and analysing the world\nand Australia with undiminished intensity suggesting a man operating as prime minister-in-exile.\n\nHis idea of leadership is more philosophical than ever, more distant from Bob Hawke or John Howard. His focus is\nthe synthesis between beauty and reason and his book encompasses China's currency, the world malaise, Mahler's\nSymphony No2 and breaking the republic with the Queen.\n\nDURING THE INTERVIEW KEATING TALKS, AS NEVER BEFORE, ABOUT HIS LEADERSHIP CONCEPT.\nBUT HE IS DOING SOMETHING ELSE: EXPLAINING HIMSELF TO A STILL PUZZLED\nNATION.RECOMMENDED COVERAGE\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029553",
