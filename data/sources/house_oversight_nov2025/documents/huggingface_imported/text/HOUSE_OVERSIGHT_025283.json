  "text": "Energy\n\nPreference: neutral\n\nBrent (24 Oct): USD 109/bbl (last month: USD 111/bbl)\nUBS View (crude oil) Brent 6-month target: USD 105-110/bbl\n¢ Growing fear over an escalation of the Syrian civil war, involving Turkey, allowed crude oil prices to move\nhigher again. While Syria's crude oil exports already dropped to near zero due to international sanctions,\nthe oil market's concerns relate to the Kirkuk—Ceyhan oil pipeline (Iraq-Turkey — capacity of 0.4mbpd) and\nthe crude exports from the Turkish port of Ceyhan, around 70km from the Syrian border.\ne Though we believe that Syria and Turkey are not interested in a military confrontation, a stop of crude oil\nflows from Iraq via Turkey would curb global incremental crude oil supply in 4Q12 by more than 50%. It\nwould also tighten up the market balance in early 2013 and put additional pressure on the structurally low\nspare capacity in the crude oil market.\ne In the absence of a further escalation, which remains our base case, ebbing news related to Syria-Turkey is\nlikely to ease supply concerns. This should keep the market focus on weak demand growth and strong\ncrude oil output from North America, allowing the Brent price to temporarily reach USD 95/bbl.\ne A weaker USD, reduced economic tail risk for Europe, ongoing social turmoil in the Middle East and\nNorth Africa and the risk that the Iranian topic heats up again after the US presidential elections are likely\nto keep the Brent price around USD 105-110/oz in 6 months.\n\n4 Positive scenario Brent 6-month target: USD 140-180/bbl\n\ne Iranian oil exports are subject to a complete embargo, which would drain another 0.5-0.75 mbpd of\nglobal crude oil supply. Alternatively, a military confrontation that affects crude oil supply via the Strait of\nHormuz would be the ultimate supply shock, requiring crude oil to be rationed on a large scale.\n\n4 Negative scenario Brent 6-month target: USD 75-80/bbl\n¢ Political tensions lead to a breakup of the Eurozone or intensify the economic contraction. At the same\ntime, the Fed is not successful in promoting growth. Supply-wise, a restoration of Iranian exports and no\nsupply cuts by OPEC would push oil inventories firmly up and weaken Brent prices towards USD 80/bbl.\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nThe biggest risk related to a potential military confrontation is an Israeli air strike\non nuclear facilities in Iran. A preemptive strike could easily destabilize the region\neven further and threaten global crude oil supply.\n\nChanges in the US gasoline blending mandate with ethanol (made from corn)\n\nlran tensions\n\nsue might fuel higher crude oil prices as spare capacity increases slides further.\nUS crude oil supply progress (room to grow by 1.3 mbpd from 2011 to 2013) isa\nvital offsetting factor to supply outages seen in the MENA region.\n\nBrepacndl Most of China's demand growth seems to be related to stock building (strategic\n\nand by refineries). If this is true, the import should stay on the weak side y/y.\n\nOil market reports Key date: 13 Nov, IEA Oil market report\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\nTactical (6 months)\ne OPEC is in a good position to balance the\n\noil market, which should limit the price\nweakness. Along with central banks’\nsupport and with the geopolitical risks\nremaining, we believe that the potential\ndownside for the oil price has declined,\nthereby warranting allocation.\n\nStrategic (3-5 years)\ne We regard the long end of the forward\n\ncurve in crude oil as mispriced. To satisfy\nemerging market demand in the long run,\nprices around USD 90-95/bbl are unlikely\nto secure the needed investments to keep\nsupply growing adequately. This gives\nstrategically oriented crude oil investors\nthe opportunity to build up some long-\nterm crude oil exposure over the next\nthree to five years.\n\nPetroleum demand in selected markets\n\nYear-on-year change — in mbpd\n\nro)\nro)\n0.8 ors NN -— AN AN\n04 S= oo Oo CO co [|\n-0.4 in nS\nTo gt 8\n-0.8 oa\n© co ov WY a @ Fe B\ne858 - S BESS\nU SE 5 S sto s\n<<\nM2012E Z013E\n\nSource: UBS, as of Oct. 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025283",
