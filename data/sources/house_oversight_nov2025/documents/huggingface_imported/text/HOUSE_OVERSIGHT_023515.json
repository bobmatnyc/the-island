First, the democratization of the\nArab world is the most important European strategic challenge of the\ndecade. Second, it was time “to take the training wheels off,” in the\nwords of Constanze Stelzenmiiller of the German Marshall Fund, and\nhave Europe rather than an overextended America lead in Libya.\nThird, the U.N. cannot always be an umbrella that folds when it rains.\nIf its “responsibility to protect” means anything, it must be when an\nArab tyrant promises to slaughter his people.\n\nWe stand at a high point in French postwar diplomacy and a nadir in\nGerman. There were strong arguments on either side of a Libyan\nintervention, but with a massacre looming in Benghazi, Germany had\nto stand with its allies. Angela Merkel has proved herself more a\nmaneuverer than a leader. Germany often conveys the sense that it\nnow resents the agents of its postwar rehabilitation — the European\nUnion and NATO.\n\nI don’t think Germany believes its future lies with the BRIC\ncountries, as the U.N. Libya vote suggested. I do think Germany has\nentered a new era of ambivalence and nationalist calculation.\n\nThat means several things. European integration is on hold, and as\nlong it’s on hold the future of the euro is at risk. The German-French\nalliance will remain under strain. Obama should look to Sarkozy, not\nMerkel, for strategic support.\n\nA last thought. This restless French leader is at his best with his back\nto the wall. He’s shown that. The same quality means it would be\nfoolish to count him out next year.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023515",
