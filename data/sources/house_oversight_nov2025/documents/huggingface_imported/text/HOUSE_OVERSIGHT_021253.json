The fact that\ngravity and magnetism are invisible to us\ndoes not place them beyond scientific\nscrutiny. Similarly, there are a host of\nforces that, over the course of human\nevolution, have emerged to influence our\nthoughts, emotions, and behaviors.\nBecause many of these forces are\n\n' The Chicago Social Brain Network is a group\nof more than a dozen scholars from the\nneurosciences, behavioral sciences, social\nsciences, and humanities who share an interest in\nwho we are as a species and the role of\nbiological and social factors in the shaping of\nindividuals, institutions, and societies across\nhuman history.\n\nThe scientists and scholars in the\nNetwork differ in background, epistemologies,\nbeliefs, and methods. After five years of\nworking together, we found a common set of\nthemes to have emerged in our work despite the\ndifferences among us. These themes, which\nprovide a different perspective on how we might\nthink about human history, experience, and\nspirituality, are examined here and explored in\nmore detail in subsequent chapters.\n\nPage |7\n\nelemental, we will be dealing with an\narea of human behavior that has also\nbeen addressed for centuries by various\nreligions. Among these are forces that\ncompel us to seek trusting and\nmeaningful connections with others and\nto seek meaning and connection with\nsomething larger than ourselves. The\nstory of these invisible forces speaks to\nwho we are and what our potential might\nbe asa species. In short, it is the story\nof the human mind.\n\nThe mind can be thought of as\nthe structure and processes responsible\nfor cognition, emotion, and behavior. It\nis now widely recognized that many\nstructures and processes of the mind\noperate outside of awareness, with only\nthe end products reaching awareness,\nand then only sometimes. But clearly we\nknow a great deal about the mind from\nwhat we experience through our senses.\nIt is just commonsense that we know the\nshape or color of an object from simply\nseeing it.\n\nOr do we? It is obvious that the\ntops of the tables depicted in the top\npanel of Figure | differ in size and\nshape. You may be surprised to learn\nthat your mind is fooling you, that the\ntops of the table are precisely the same\nsize and shape. If you don’t believe it,\ntrace and cut a piece of paper the size of\n\none table\nra top and\n\\ then place\n\nit over the\nother.\nSelf-\nevident\ntruths can sometimes be absolutely false.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021253",
