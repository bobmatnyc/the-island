  "text": "Listening to the concert program in my parents’ room was something I\nalways looked forward to. It was my father who encouraged me, when I was\neight, to begin learning to play the piano. I took lessons once a week all during\nmy childhood along with several other of the kibbutz children. When we got old\nenough, we took turns playing a short piece — the secular, kibbutz equivalent of\nan opening prayer — at the Friday-night meal in the dining hall. I have always\ncherished being able to play. Sitting down at the piano and immersing myself in\nTchaikovsky, Beethoven, Schubert or Mozart never ceases to bring me a sense\nof calm, freedom and, especially nowadays, when I have finally worked to\nmaster a particularly intricate piece, a feeling of pure joy.\n\nAs a young child, I spent most of my waking hours in the company of my\nseveral dozen kibbutz “siblings” in the children’s home, the dining hall, or\nrunning through the open spaces in the center of the kibbutz with our metapelet.\nShe would often take us through the orange groves in the afternoon, and\nsometimes across the main road to the Arab village.\n\nWadi Khawaret consisted of a few dozen concrete homes built back from a\nmain street bordered by shops and storehouses.

The people seemed warm, and\nbenignly indifferent to the dozen Jewish toddlers and their metapelet. My own\nattitude to Wadi Khawaret was of benign curiosity. I did not imagine that within\na couple of years we would be on opposite sides of a war. I enjoyed these visits,\nas I enjoyed every part of my early childhood. Each age-group on the kibbutz\nwas given a name. Ours was called dror. It was the Hebrew word for\n“freedom”.\n\nBut dror was also the name of one of the Jewish youth movements in the\nWarsaw Ghetto, heroes in their doomed uprising against the Nazis.
