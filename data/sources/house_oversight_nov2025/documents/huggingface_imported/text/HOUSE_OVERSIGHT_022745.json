  "text": "Although he has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may\nbe as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with\nit—that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute\nbadness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather\nthan work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and\nentitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a\ncorrect and prudish world; someone who somehow didn’t get the memo\nabout vast changes in mores and culture.\n\nWhen I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus is\nto get married, he said he would rather go back to jail.\n\nHe is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.\n\nThis is all, inevitably, a Gatsby-like story. But Gatsby in New York\nPost and Daily Mail parlance would likely be a freaky financier too.\n\nAnd it’s a story about the limitation of journalism, in which the most\ncompelling parts of the story—it would take a long running cable show to do\njustice to the meaning of Epstein’s ambitions and impulses—need to be\nsacrificed for not just moral certainty but for a rather preposterous fantasy of\nmoral certainty.\n\nAnyway, I hope I get invited back to Jeffrey’s house.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022745",
