  "text": "262 13 Local, Global and Glocal Knowledge Representation\n\n13.6.1 A Semi-Formal Model of Glocal Memory\n\nTo explain the notion of glocal memory more precisely, we will introduce a simple semi-formal\nmodel of a system S that uses a memory to record information relevant to the actions it\ncarries out. The overall concept of glocal memory should not be considered as restricted to\nthis particular model. This model is not intended for maximal generality, but is intended to\nencompass a variety of current AI system designs and formal neurological models.\n\nIn this model, we will consider S’s memory subsystem as a set of objects we’ll call “tokens,”\nembedded in some metric space. The metric in the space, which we will call the “basic distance”\nof the memory, generally will not be defined in terms of the semantics of the items stored in the\nmemory; though it may come to shape these dynamics through the specific architecture and\nevolution of the memory. Note that these tokens are not intended as generally being mapped\none-to-one onto meaningful items stored in the memory. The “tokens” are the raw materials\nthat the memory arranges in various patterns in order to store items.\n\nWe assume that each token, at each point in time, may meaningfully be assigned a certain\nquantitative “activation level.” Also, tokens may have other numerical or discrete quantities\nassociated with them, depending on the particular memory architecture. Finally, tokens may\nrelate other tokens, so that optionally a token may come equipped with an (ordered or un-\nordered) list of other tokens.\n\nTo understand the meaning of the activation levels, one should think about S’s memory\nsubsystem as being coupled with an action-selection subsystem, that dynamically chooses the\nactions to be taken by the overall system in which the two subsystems are embedded. Each\ncombination of actions, in each particular type of context, will generally be associated with the\nactivation of certain tokens in memory.\n\nThen, as analysts of the system S, we may associate each token T with an “activation vector”\nv(T,t), whose value for each discrete time ¢ consists of the activation of the token T at time t.\nSo, the 50’th entry of the vector corresponds to the activation of the token at the 50/th time\nstep.\n\n“Items stored in memory” over a certain period of time, may then be defined as clusters in\nthe set of activation vectors associated with memory during that period of time. Note that the\nsystem S itself may explicitly recognize and remember patterns regarding what items are stored\nin its memory — but, from an external analyst’s perspective, the set of items in S’s memory is\nnot restricted to the ones that S has explicitly recognized as memory items.\n\nThe “localization” of a memory item may be defined as the degree to which the various tokens\ninvolved in the item are close to each other according to the metric in the memory metric-space.\nThis degree may be formalized in various ways, but choosing a particular quantitative measure\nis not important here. A highly localized item may be called “local” and a not-very-localized\nitem may be called “global.”\n\nWe may define the “activation distance” of two tokens as the distance between their activation\nvectors. We may then say that a memory is “well aligned” to the extent that there is a correlation\nbetween the activation distance of tokens, and the basic distance of the memory metric-space.\n\nGiven the above set-up, the basic notion of glocal memory can be enounced fairly simply. A\nglocal memory is one:\n\ne that is reasonably well-aligned (i.e. the correlation between activation and basic distance is\nsignificantly greater than random)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013178",
