  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n197\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\ndemonstrating the torts exception outlined\nin (a)() provides a basis for subject matter\njurisdiction here.\n\n[20] To fit within the exception out-\nlined in § 1605(a)(5), the Plaintiffs must\ncome forward with evidence demonstrating\nthe Princes’ or Kingdom’s tortious acts or\nomissions caused Plaintiffs’ injuries.2* 28\nU.S.C. § 1605(a)(5); Virtual Countries,\n300 F.3d at 241; Cargill, 991 F.2d at 1016.\n“Any terrorist act, including the Septem-\nber 11 attacks, might have been the natu-\nral and probable consequence of knowingly\nand intentionally providing financial sup-\nport to al Qaeda, given [the complaints’]\nallegations that, prior to September 11, al\nQaeda and Osama bin Laden had _ pro-\nclaimed their intentions to commit murder-\nous terrorist activities against the United\nStates and its citizens, ... and had accom-\npanied these words with actions by imple-\nmenting, and publicly acknowledging re-\nsponsibility for, such terrorist schemes as\nthe 1993 bombing of the World Trade Cen-\nter, the 1998 attack of the U.S. embassies\nin Kenya and Tanzania, and the 2000 at-\ntack of the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen.” Bur-\nnett [, 274 F.Supp.2d at 105; see also\nAshton Complaint 11 105-108 (1993 World\nTrade Center attack), 180-1386 (embassy\nbombings), 152-55 (Cole attack); Federal\nComplaint 177 (alleging Osama Bin Laden\nestablished al Qaeda to wage war with the\nUnited States).\n\n26. Plaintiffs argue that Judge Robertson held\nthem to an unnecessarily stringent theory of\ncausation and submit that the D.C. Circuit’s\nsubsequent decision in Kilburn v. Socialist\nPeople’s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 376 F.3d\n1123 (D.C.Cir.2004), effectively overrules the\nholding in Burnett IT. See Kilburn, 376 F.3d at\n1129 (evaluating a claim under § 1605(a)(7)\nand holding the requirement for jurisdictional\ncausation was proximate cause). This Court\ndoes not read Burnett IJ as requiring but-for\ncausation and Defendants agreed at oral ar-\ngument that the proper inquiry at this stage of\n\na. Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\n\n[21] Both Princes are alleged to have\ntortiously aided and abetted terrorism\nthrough their contributions to, and support\nof, Islamic charities that they knew or\nshould have known were supporting ter-\nrorist organizations such as al Qaeda.”\nAdditionally, Plaintiffs allege Prince Turki\naided and abetted the terrorists by at-\ntempting to deflect their activities away\nfrom Saudi Arabia and by serving as a\n“facilitator of Osama bin Laden’s network\nof charities.” Ashton Complaint 1261;\nBurnett Complaint 1350. Plaintiffs allege\nboth Princes must have known that the\nUnited States would have been al Qaeda’s\ntarget, making the attacks on September\n11 a foreseeable result of the Princes’ ac-\ntions.\n\n[22-24] Pursuant to the Second Cir-\ncuit’s instruction, the Court must first de-\ntermine whether the Princes’ acts are tor-\ntious under New York law. Robinson, 269\nF.3d at 142. In New York, conspiracy and\naiding and abetting are varieties of con-\ncerted action liability. Pittman v. Gray-\nson, 149 F.8d 111, 122 (@d Cir.1998).\nThere must be “(1) an express or tacit\nagreement to ‘participate in a common\nplan or design to commit a tortious act,’ (2)\ntortious conduct by each defendant, and (8)\nthe commission by one of the defendants,\nin pursuance of the agreement, of an act\nthat constitutes a tort.” Jd. (quoting\n\nthe litigation is the presence of proximate\n\ncausation. See Sept. 14, 2004 Tr. at 121.\n\n27. To the extent that the consolidated Plain-\ntiffs and the Federal Plaintiffs allege that\nPrince Sultan and Prince Turki made dona-\ntions in their personal capacities, see, e.g.,\nAshton Complaint { 269 (Prince Sultan); Fed-\neral Complaint 9451-52 (Prince Turki),\nthose claims are not subject to the FSIA’s\nprotection. The Court will determine wheth-\ner it has personal jurisdiction over Prince\nSultan and Prince Turki in Part II.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017862",
