This campaign would aim to\nseverely damage the nuclear program, limit Iran’s ability to defend\nagainst the attack (and subsequent restrikes, if necessary) and reduce\nits capabilities for post-attack retaliation.\n\nA regime-change option would require a broad military offensive that\ncould include nuclear facilities, air defenses, Iran’s retaliatory\ncapabilities, leadership targets, regime supporters, and national\ninfrastructure and economic targets. This could include putting some\nforces on the ground to collect intelligence and neutralize specific\ntargets that are difficult to strike effectively with air power. No large-\nscale ground operations are likely, but they cannot be ruled out at\nsome levels of conflict and in some scenarios, such as those that posit\na need to open and secure passage through the Strait of Hormuz and\nPersian Gulf.\n\nIn general, the more expansive a war’s goals as a plan escalates from\nstrike to campaign to broad offensive, the greater the force needed to\nachieve those goals, the greater the uncertainty in achieving them,\nand the greater the consequences of both success and failure.\nMoreover, a war’s goals at the outset of conflict may not remain\nstable. Early sudden successes or unanticipated failures can lead to\nthe escalation of initially limited goals, particularly if terminating\nhostilities proves difficult. Lateral expansion as well as escalation is\nalso possible: Iranian leaders might surrender or agree to a truce but\nbe unable to enforce a similar decision on Hizballah leaders or terror\nagents around the world. This leads to yet another layer of complexity\nand uncertainty: Whose war would this be?\n\nA U.S.-Iranian war would probably not be fought by the United\nStates and Iran alone. Each would have partners or allies, both\nwilling and not-so-willing. Pre-conflict commitments, longstanding\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018107",
