  "text": "12.4 Ethical Synergy 213\n\ngood” dichotomous decision making, but also the ability to develop moral decision networks\nwhich do not require that all situations be solved through resolution of a dichotomy.\n\nWhen more than one person is being affected by an ethical decision, making a decision based\non reducing two choices to a single decision can often lead to decisions of dubious ethics. How-\never, a sufficiently complex uncertain inference network can represent alternate choices in which\nmultiple actions are taken that have equal (or near equal) belief weight but have very different\nparticulars — but because the decisions are applied in different contexts (to different groups of\nindividuals) they are morally equivalent. Though each individual action appears equally be-\nlievable, were any single decision applied to the entire population one or more individual may\nbe harmed, and the morally superior choice is to make case-dependent decisions. Equal moral\ntreatment is a general principle, and too often the mistake is made by thinking that to achieve\nthis general principle the particulars must be equal. This is not the case. Different treatment of\ndifferent individuals can result in morally equivalent treatment of all involved individuals, and\nmay be vastly morally superior to treating all the individuals with equal particulars. Simply\ntaking the largest population and deciding one course of action based on the result that is most\nappealing to that largest group is not generally the most moral action.\n\nUncertain inference, especially a complex network with high levels of resource access as may\nbe found in a sophisticated AGI, is well suited for complex decision making resulting in a\nmultitude of actions, and of analyzing the options to find the set of actions that are ethically\noptimal particulars for each decision context. Reflexive cognition and post-commitment moral\nunderstanding may be the goal stages of an AGI system, or any intelligence, but the other\nstages will be passed through on the way to that goal, and realistically some minds will never\nreach higher order cognition or morality with regards to any context, and others will not be\nable to function at this high order in every context (all currently known minds fail to function\nat. the highest order cognitively or morally in some contexts).\n\nInfantile and concrete cognition are the underpinnings of the egoist and socialized stages,\nwith formal aspects also playing a role in a more complete understanding of social models\nwhen thinking using the social modalities. Cognitively infantile patterns can produce no more\nthan blind egoism as without a theory of mind, there is no capability to consider the other.\nSince most intelligences acquire concrete modality and therefore some nascent social perspective\nrelatively quickly, most egoists are instrumental egoists. The social relationship and systems\nperspectives include formal aspects which are achieved by systematic social experimentation,\nand therefore experiential reinforcement learning of correct and incorrect social modalities.\nInitially this is a one-on-one approach (relationship stage), but as more knowledge of social\naction and consequences is acquired, a formal thinker can understand not just consequentiality\nbut also intentionality in social action.\n\nExtrapolation from models of individual interaction to general social theoretic notions is also\na formal action. Rational, logical positivist approaches to social and political ideas, however, are\nthe norm of formal thinking. Contractual and committed moral ethics emerges from a higher-\norder formalization of the social relationships and systems patterns of thinking. Generalizations\nof social observation become, through formal analysis, systems of social and political doctrine.\nHighly committed, but grounded and logically supportable, belief is the hallmark of formal\ncognition as expressed contractual moral stage. Though formalism is at work in the socialized\nmoral stages, its fullest expression is in committed contractualism.\n\nFinally, reflexive cognition is especially important in truly reaching the post-commitment\nmoral stage in which nuance and complexity are accommodated. Because reflexive cognition\nis necessary to change one’s mind not just about particular rational ideas, but whole ways of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013129",
