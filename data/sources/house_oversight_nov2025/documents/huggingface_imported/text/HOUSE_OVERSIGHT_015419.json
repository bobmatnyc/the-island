  "text": "Words and Phrases That I’ ve Coined\n\n| really don’ t like to boast, but in my lifetime, on half a dozen\noccasions, | have actually added words and phrases to the language. It’ s\nsomething | always wanted to do. What a thrill it must have been for Dr.\nHarold Cerumen, who decided that cleaning out earwax should be known\nas “cerumen disimpaction.” And veterinarian Alice Neuticle who coined\nthe word “neuticles” —cosmetic testicles for a dog that’ s been\nneutered.\n\nSo I’ m not asking for credit. Or cash. Since money had been called\n“dough” and then morphed into “bread,” | figured that “toast”\nwould be the next logical step in that particular linguistic evolution, but my\ncampaign itself became toast, in the sense that “toast” now means\n\nhistory.\n\nAlso, | was intrigued by the process of having a body part named\nafter oneself. How proud Casper Bartholin’ s parents must have been to\nhave a son who christened the source of female lubrication that takes the\nfriction out of intercourse as “Bartholin’ s glands.” But my idea of\ncalling those two vertical lines between your nose and your mouth\n\n“Krassner’ s crease” just never became popular.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015419",
