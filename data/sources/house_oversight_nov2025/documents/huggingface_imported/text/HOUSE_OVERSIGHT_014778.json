  "text": "Bullish USD/JPY\n\nThe election of Donald Trump catapulted USD/JPY through another resistance level, this\ntime a weekly trend line, adding to the list of technical signals that USD/JPY has\nbottomed and is in an uptrend. We began discussing a bottom in our September 5 and\nSeptember 18 Technical Advantage reports. We estimate technical upside and\nresistance in the area of 112. We also think this uptrend has the potential to reach the\nfull measured move target of 116.50 in 2017.\n\nChart 80: USD/JPY weekly chart\n\nMUSD-JPY X-RATE - Last Price |\nMB SMAVG (50) on Close 108.71\nMSMAVG (200) on Close 108.47\n\n0,0%( 125.86)\n\nF125\n\nF120\n100.0% 116.48)\nflls\n\n50.0%( 100.60)\n\nny\nMajor Support\n\n100.0%(75.35)\n\nUSDIPY MMACD(12,26) -0.6488 MSig(9) -1.6916—EDiff TH428 -_ 4.00\n= gy 2.00\n\n- fll = —\n_— 2g ART Tas pon a NTN Aiseeteast. oy ssasrqyanarenennee™ Mtn. pene certnnan OEM tn. a =\" peyeuggenne=—-ene nl 0.00\n— _ 7 -2,00\nullish cross -4.00\n\nA\nf USDIPY MRSI 57.8881 (10B 70.00 ©10S 39-00 | wry f\\ J ra \\ : 80\n\n2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nA higher yield environment\nWe continue to think yields will trend higher in 2017. We initially reported our view that\n\nglobal yields would rise in our October 26 Technical Advantage report. Since then we\nhave seen added confirmation by US 10y, US 30y, 10yr bund, 30yr JGB and 10y Gilt that\nyields will rise.\n\nUS 10y and 30y yield form wedge bottom pattern\n\nUS 10y and 30y yields formed wedge bottom patterns by breaking through the upper\ntrend line resistance (Breakout 1). A wedge pattern is composed of two converging\ntrend lines often consisting of multiple smaller trends followed by a breakout. Each yield\nhas a second resistant trend line and Fibonacci retracement to break. If 10y yield breaks\nthrough 2.35% and 30y yield through 3.15%, then another breakout will have occurred\nthat technically triggers another leg higher to 2.98% and 3.80%, respectively. We think\nthis is the more likely outcome.\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n48 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014778",
