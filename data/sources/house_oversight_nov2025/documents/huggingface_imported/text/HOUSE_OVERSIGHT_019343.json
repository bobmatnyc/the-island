Objective: an alliance \nbetween right-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru \nwho was Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following \nthe racist violence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the \nDaily Beast himself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in \nthe heart of Europe and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in \nview of the European elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor \nof the Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in \nsupport of NGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist \nright, accused of plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in \norder to have labour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current \nMinister of the Interior Matteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in \nthe European campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London \nand Rome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of \nwhich he has long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of \nstrategic advice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme \nEuropean movements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and \nchanneling funding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. \nThe American strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US \nCongress — and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019344 \nused data stolen from Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald \nTrump emerged victor. It is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right \nfrom East to West. And he has already met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine \nLe Pen and the former leader of the British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, \ncoincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican \ncongressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If \nit works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. \nIn short, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But \nin the future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also \nbecause the relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael \nWolff and published in the scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in \nParadise,\" Bannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost \nParadise. Hell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The \"army of \ndarkness\" is already among us. \nIn Sacratissimo Corde Iesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph. \n******* \nBenjamin Harnwell \nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees \nDignitatis Humanae Institute \nCell: \nOffice: \nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae \n44 Via delle Foripci  \nRoma 00165  \nITALY  \n@ben harnwell \nwww.dignitatishumanae.com \nII giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon > ha scritto: \nWhat does this say??? \nBegin forwarded message: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019345 \nFrom: Maria Luisa <______________________ \nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT \nTo: Steve Bannon IMII>, Preate Alexandra <_______________________> \n<PHOTO-2018-07-22-10-02-17.jpg> \nSent from my iPhone \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
