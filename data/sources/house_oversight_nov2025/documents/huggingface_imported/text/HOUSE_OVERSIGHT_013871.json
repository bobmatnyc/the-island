  "text": "A true account by AJ Jacobs, editor-at-large at Esquire magazine (ellipses represent passage of time\nbetween entries)\n\nIT BEGAN a month ago. I was midway through The World Is Flat, the bestseller by Tom Friedman. I\nlike Friedman, despite his puzzling decision to wear a mustache. His book is all about how outsourcing\nto India and China is not just for tech support and carmakers but is poised to transform every industry in\nAmerica, from law to banking to accounting.\n\nI don’t have a corporation; I don’t even have an up-to-date business card. I’m a writer and editor\nworking from home, usually in my boxer shorts or, if ’'m feeling formal, my penguin-themed pajama\nbottoms. Then again, I think, why should Fortune 500 firms have all the fun? Why can’t I join in on the\nbiggest business trend of the new century? Why can’t I outsource my low-end tasks? Why can’t I\noutsource my life?\n\nThe next day I e-mail Brickwork, one of the companies Friedman mentions in his book. Brickwork —\nbased in Bangalore, India—offers “remote executive assistants,” mostly to financial firms and healthcare\ncompanies that want data processed. I explain that I'd like to hire someone to help with Esquire-related\ntasks —doing research, formatting memos, like that. The company’s CEO, Vivek Kulkarni, responds, “It\nwould be a great pleasure to be talking to a person of your stature.” Already I’m liking this. ve never\nhad stature before. In America, I barely command respect from a Bennigan’s maitre d’, so it’s nice to\nknow that in India I have stature.\n\nA couple of days later, I get an e-mail from my new “remote executive assistant.”\n\nDear Jacobs,\n\nMy name is Honey K. Balani. I would be assisting you in your editorial and personal job.... I\nwould try to adapt myself as per your requirements that would lead to desired satisfaction.\n\nDesired satisfaction. This is great. Back when I worked at an office, I had assistants, but there was\nnever any talk of desired satisfaction. In fact, if anyone ever used the phrase “desired satisfaction,” we’d\nall end up in a solemn meeting with HR.\n\nI GO OUT to dinner with my friend Misha, who grew up in India, founded a software firm, and\nsubsequently became nauseatingly rich. I tell him about Operation Outsource. “You should call Your\nMan in India,” he says. Misha explains that this is a company for Indian businessmen who have moved\noverseas but who still have parents back in New Delhi or Mumbai. YMII is their overseas concierge\nservice—it buys movie tickets and cell phones and other sundries for abandoned moms.\n\nPerfect. This could kick my outsourcing up to a new level. I can have a nice, clean division of labor:\nHoney will take care of my business affairs, and YMII can attend to my personal life—pay my bills,\nmake vacation reservations, buy stuff online. Happily, YMII likes the idea, and just like that the support\nteam at Jacobs Inc. has doubled.\n\nHONEY HAS completed her first project for me: research on the person Esquire has chosen as the\nSexiest Woman Alive. I’ve been assigned to write a profile of this woman, and I really don’t want to\nhave to slog through all the heavy-breathing fan websites about her. When I open Honey’s file, I have\nthis reaction: America is f*cked. There are charts. There are section headers. There is a well-organized\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013871",
