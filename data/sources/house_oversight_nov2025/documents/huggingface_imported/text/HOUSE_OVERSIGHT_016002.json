  "text": "312 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nHow often do you hear the phrase, “It's down to tradeoffs,” or “It’s a\nmatter of priorities’, or even “You can't have your cake and eat it?”\n\nThese stock statements misunderstand the infinitely complex nature\nof creativity and problem solving. Let us take a concrete example: the car.\n\nMy first car was a Volkswagen Polo. It was a great little car, quite\nnippy, cassette-radio, and four seats. The most recent Polo has antilock\nbrakes, airbags, NCAP 5-star crash resistance, smarter styling, and a low\nemission engine. Shall I go on...? The doctrine of tradeoffs says I would\nhave to give up something to gain these new features. But, I have not.\nThe newer Polo is cheaper in real terms than my original, as well as being\nbetter designed.\n\nProblems always have at least two dimensions of freedom. We can\ntrade one feature for another or we can innovate to both have our cake\nand eat it! We are never constrained to simple on-the-one-hand, on-the-\nother-hand type decisions. Creativity is unconstrained by linear rules\nand tradeoffs.\n\nProcess versus Creativity\nHow many times have you heard the words, “We must create a process\nfor this!”\n\nIn its place, process is good; It makes things consistent, repeatable\nand predictable. You can follow a process by rote without error. Processes\nare also easy to document and communicate because they are symbolic.\nBut process is limited. It is, after all, a set of prescribed rules for solving a\nparticular problem — and, because of this, it falls into the same trap.\n\nA process cannot solve a problem that requires creative thought or\nlogic more complex than the logic limit. Logical processes are useful for\ntracking lists. I am reassured when I get on an airplane and know the\npilot has been through a preflight checklist. I would not want to fly in an\nairplane where the pilot announced he was taking a creative approach to\nthe preflight check.\n\nProcess is a perfect tool for organizing the steps around being\ncreative, but it won't do the creating for you.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016002",
