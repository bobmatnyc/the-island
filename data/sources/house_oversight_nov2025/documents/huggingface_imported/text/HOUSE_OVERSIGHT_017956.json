Wholly absent at this point was any assertion by Mr. Dershowitz that Ms. Roberts\nwas lying, or that she made up her charge as part of an extortion claim, or that after investigating\nhis alleged evidence Ms. Roberts’ lawyer did not believe her. On the contrary, Mr. Dershowitz\nexpressly recognized that Ms. Roberts’ belief was an honest one.
