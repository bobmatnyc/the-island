White House ‘looking into’ Acosta’s role in illegal sex offender plea deal

By JOHN T. BENNETT
CQ-Roll Call

WASHINGTON — _ White
House press secretary Sarah Huck-
abee Sanders on Friday declined
to say whether President Donald
Trump still has confidence in La-
bor Secretary Alexander Acosta, a
day after a federal judge ruled the
Justice Department broke the law
while Acosta was a U.S. attorney.

A judge said Acosta — then the
U.S. attorney in Miami — signed
off on a plea deal with Jeffrey Ep-
stein, the Palm Beach billionaire
and serial sex abuser, without in-
forming victims about what they
were doing.

Epstein also owns the island
of Little St. James in the Virgin
Islands,

“My understanding is that it’s
a very complicated case, some-
thing we're certainly looking into,”
Sanders said.

The  Florida-
based U.S. Dis-
trict Judge Ken-
neth A. Marra
ruled Acosta and
other — officials
did not confer
with — Epstein’s
: victims about
Jeffrey Epstein the 2008 plea

agreement, But,
notably, she appeared to defend the
labor boss.

“But that they made the best
possible deal that they could have
gotten at that time,” she said. “But,
again, that’s something we're look-
ing into.”

A federal judge said U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander
Acosta — then the U.S. attorney in Miami — signed
off on a plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, the Palm Beach
billionaire and serial sex abuser, without informing the
dozens of victims about what they were doing.
Epstein also owns the island of little St. James in the

Virgin Islands.

Asked if Trump still has confi-
dence in the latest member of his
Cabinet — which he frequently
praises as doing a collective solid
job — Sanders declined to say
the president does. “Again, that’s
something we're looking into,” the
spokeswoman said, “I'm not aware
of any changes.”

The judge said in his decision
Thursday that he had reviewed
evidence showing Epstein sexu-
ally abused more than 30 underage
girls at his Palm Beach mansion
and elsewhere.

The Crime Victims’ Rights Act
promises victims that the Justice
Department would make its “best

efforts” to protect a victim, the fil-
ing said. It allows victims the “rea-
sonable right” to confer with the
U.S. attorneys handling the case.

The deal reached between Acos-
ta and Epstein’s attorneys allowed
him to not be prosecuted in fed-
eral court, and instead sentenced
in state court. The immunity from
prosecution also extended to some
of Epstein’s co-conspirators.

Epstein pleaded guilty to two
prostitution charges and served 13
months in county jail, according
to the Miami Herald. The victims
were not told of the agreement or
sentencing until it was too late to
intervene,

The Department of Justice an-
nounced earlier this month it has
opened an investigation into the
handling of Epstein’s case.
