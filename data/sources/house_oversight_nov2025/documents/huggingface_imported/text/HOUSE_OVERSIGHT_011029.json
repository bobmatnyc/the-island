  "text": "This observation helps clarify my hypothesis that job learning costs no time that\nmight otherwise have been spent earning pay. My deeper meaning is that invested\nlearning and maintenance learning are the same process costing the same time but\nwith different economic effect, much as with invested and maintenance\n\nconsumption.\n\nEvidence that hourly if not yearly pay rises until retirement, or very near, would\nrefute Ben-Porath’s claim if human capital ended at retirement. But it continues\n\nthrough retirement because imputed pay does.\n\nMill and a few economists before him acknowledged “productive” and\n“unproductive” consumption. The productive kind was what I call maintenance and\ninvested consumption. Unproductive consumption meant any written invested for\n\nhigher pay later nor supporting survival pay now. That would give\n\npure consumption = maintenance consumption + unproductive consumption (5.8)\n\nand\n\nconsumption = invested consumption + pure consumption\n= invested consumption + maintenance consumption\n\n+ unproductive consumption. (5.9)\n\nInvestment and maintenance contrast in human capital as in a firm. Investment is\nvalued only in the expectation of future maintenance. No maintenance later, no\nvalue now. To count maintenance as new investment would count part of the old\ninvestment twice. Where the accounting treatments differ is in disposition.\nMaintenance in the firm is recovered in pay and products. | thought before that the\nsame was true of human capital. Thanks to the parable of the boss and her secretary,\n\nI now I think it is exhausted in satisfying our taste for lineage survival.\n\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011029",
