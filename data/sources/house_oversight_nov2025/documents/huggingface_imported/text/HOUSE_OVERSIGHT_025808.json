  "text": "virtual nuke. They will be there by June, 2013. If Iran gets the bomb this will make\na mockery of US and UN. Lead to copy cats developing nukes — especially KSA.\nIt would be the end of nuclear non-proliferation and significantly increase chance of\nnuclear event. This is very, very unattractive. We should explore third way\nbetween now and end of the year. Diplomatic path would have to be coercive\ndiplomacy. Sanctions are hurting, but we only have 6 months and that is not enough\ntime. Must convince Chinese and Russians of consequences of a military strike.\nWe should allow some (5%) enrichment with inspections. This gives Iran a way\nout.\n\nIf none of the above works, US should strike. We could launch a devastating strike\n(Israel does not have that ability). (nighttime, B-2, deep penetration bombs). First\nstrike should be limited to nuke facilities. US strike will be more effective militarily\nand narrow the political consequences.\n\nEnergy and GCC\nTJP Summary: Write up\n\nMeghan O: ME may not be able to supply quantity of energy that people are\nassuming. 2020-2030 most predictions assume increasing oil supplies from ME.\nMoving world supply coming from ME from 30 to 38%. Most increase scheduled\nto come from KSA and Iraq. Are these reasonable assumptions. Oil is there, but\npolitics is problematic. 1. Internal stability is in question. Following a revolution it\nis very slow to rebuild production; 2. Reinvestment rates will decline. KSA was\nplanning to move from 12.5mm bbl to 15 mm bbl with a $10 bn investment. That\nhas been cancelled in deference to social needs. As there is a push for democracy,\nthe autocrat needs to increase social spending. As population (and joblessness)\nincreae, autocrat needs to increase social spending. Aversion to FDI. We are likely\nto see supply from ME decline. Iraq and Iran could take up some of the slack.\nHowever, we have an American Energy Revolution in play. From 2006 to 2012 we\nhave gone from importing LNG to finding 100 years supply of gas. Shale is also\nproducing oil. Bakkan field has gone from 187k bbl/day to 750k bbl/day in 5 years.\nBy 2020-2030 they exepect Bakkan to produce 1.3 mm bbl/day (same as Libya).\nAdd Gulf of Mex and by 2020 US will be producing 6.7mm bbl/day. Harvard is\nestimating 11mm bbl/day. Similar situation in Brazil and Mexico.\n\nEconomic benefits will be great. Political benefits will be there, but we will still\nhave vital interests in ME. 1. Gas won’t substitute for oil; 2. We have other\ninterests in ME (geography, heart of Islamic fundamentalism etc.);3. Oijlisa\nglobal commodity. Disruptions in ME oils supply will affect US; 3. KSA still has\n\n12\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025808",
