It was as if, knowing I would soon be\nheading for the front line, he wondered whether we’d see each other again.\n\nI made my way to the office that the chief of staff used in the bunker and\nasked Dado’s secretary if I could see him. As she was deciding whether to let\nme in, he emerged. Though obviously aware of the seriousness of the situation,\nDado radiated his usual calm and confidence. For the first time, I felt a bit more\nhopeful. “Ma nishmah, Ehud? he asked, in Israelis’ everyday greeting. “What’s\nup?” I told him I’d just come from the airport. “I can help in special forces,\ninfantry, armor. Whichever is most needed.”\n\n“Leading a tank unit,” he said. ““They’ve suffered heavy losses. Go see\nTzipori.” Motke Tzipori was in charge of organizing the armored units. He sent\nme to Julis, the training base between Tel Aviv and Beersheva, where tanks\nfrom maintenance units around the country were being brought. Once they were\nreasonably operational, and as more reservists arrived from abroad, I would lead\na makeshift battalion to help reinforce our badly depleted forces in the Sinai.\n\nI was just one of dozens of officers, in command of thousands of tireless and\ncourageous troops called on to try to turn the tide. Most were reservists. Many,\nlike me, had rushed home in the knowledge that for the first time since 1948,\nthere was the real risk Israel would be defeated. By the time I got my battle\norders — October 14, the ninth day of the war — Israeli forces on the Golan, at\nenormous cost, had managed to turn back the Syrian attack. In this war, the men\nfrom Sayeret Matkal were not bystanders. Most of the unit joined the fightback\nin the north, where, under Yoni Netanyahu’s command, they took on and\ndefeated a Syrian commando force in the heart of the Golan. Yoni himself\nrisked his life to rescue a wounded officer from another unit behind enemy\nlines.\n\nIn the Sinai, however, the situation remained dire. An initial counterattack,\nlaunched while I was on my way to Julis, ended up in tatters, with whole\nbattalions all but destroyed, as our tanks came under fire from rocket-propelled\ngrenades and, above all, the wire-guided Saggers. Israel’s main advantage in\n1967 — our command of the skies — was all but gone. By moving their surface-\n\n148\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027996",
