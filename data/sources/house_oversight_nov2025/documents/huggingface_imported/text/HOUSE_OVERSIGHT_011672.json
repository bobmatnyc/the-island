  "text": "to get air support, but the commander of our artillery force called in all available\nunits, and they drew a kind of protective box of shellfire around Ira’s men as\nthey moved back. We sent our other reserve division towards the crossroads to\nprovide support, and Amram went with them to co-ordinate the operation. But\nIra still had to fight his way out. It was 15 minutes of hell. By the time he\nreached safety at around nine in the morning, he’d lost ten tanks and nearly 20\nmen, four of them during the final, frantic retreat. Five more were missing. The\nreserve division also found itself in a fierce firefight with the Syrians, and lost\neleven men.\n\nWe were now just three hours from the cease-fire. We did advance nearer to\nthe Beirut-Damascus road. An hour before noon, our dedicated anti-tank unit\ndestroyed 20 of Assad’s top-tier tanks, Soviet-made T-72s. Under different\ncircumstances, those successes might have been a cause for consolation. Yet it\nwas hard to dwell on them given what had happened north of Tovlano. After the\nwar, Sultan Yacoub created fertile ground for conspiracy theories, half-truths\nand finger-pointing. That there had been many oversights and errors was clear,\nthough there was never a full and formal debriefing process to identify in detail\nwhat had gone wrong. I found it deeply frustrating that, unlike in 1973 when I'd\nbeen in a battlefield command role, I was now at several steps removed from\nwhat was happening on the ground. But everyone involved shared responsibility\nfor the failures — including the overall commanders: Yanoush, and me as well.\n\nThat weight felt even heavier because the tragedy occurred only hours before\nour own force’s involvement in the Lebanon War was over.\n\nIt was not, however, the end of the war. The cease-fire held only\nintermittently in the rest of Lebanon, barely at all in some areas. Freed from\nfighting in our sector, Yanoush, Amram and I began spending time with units\nelsewhere. A couple of days after the cease-fire, I found myself alongside a pair\nof generals, Uri Simchoni and Yossi Ben-Hannan, south of Beirut. In front of\nus, troops from the Golani Brigade were completing their takeover of Beirut\nairport. “You were right,” I told Uri and Yossi. They had been in charge of the\nsimulation exercise in the Airya, predicting how Arik’s ostensibly more limited\ninvasion plan would inevitably develop into Big Pines.
