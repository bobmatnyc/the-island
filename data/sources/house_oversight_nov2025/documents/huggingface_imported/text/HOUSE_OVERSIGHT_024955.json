  "text": "His Highness the President of the UAE has also openly clarified different dimensions of the crisis’s impact on\nthe UAE economy. Despite all that, some people in the media have continued to weave rumors and negative\nspeculation into their articles. We welcome all media from around the globe and we have never silenced any\nresident or visiting reporters or stopped them from doing their job.\n\nWe shall continue to do the same because of our confidence in ourselves, our economy and our measures -- and\nbecause we always believe deep in our hearts that truth prevails. Yet our self-confidence does not stop us from\ndialogue with the media to offer them straightforward information. We urge them to adhere to professional\nintegrity, objectivity, and fair scrutiny and use of information.\n\nEmirates Business 24/7\n\nThere has been some contraction in business volumes in the UAE over the last few\nmonths. The harshest effect of this seems to have been on small and medium-sized\nenterprises. Is there any plan to revitalize the small business sector, which is usually co\nnsidered the growth engine of an economy?\n\nWe are fully aware of the vital role of the small and medium enterprises sector; I believe that the contraction it\nhas suffered is only temporary. Our success in overcoming the worst will positively reflect on the overall\neconomy, including major enterprises as well as small and medium-sized ones. Our position is far better than\nother countries, and encouraging economic indicators have just started to emerge. Enhanced liquidity levels\nacross the banking sector, banks’ resumption of credit operations, increased number of investors eager to seize\ninvestment opportunities in the real estate sector and financial markets, are among many other positive and\nencouraging indicators.\n\nEmirates Business 24/7\n\nThe region is clearly looking at nuclear energy as means to meet its energy needs in the\nfuture. What is your view on the proliferation of nuclear technology in the Middle East?\n\nThe UAE’s announced stance is very clear: All countries have the right to use nuclear power for peaceful\npurposes. We look forward for the day when the entire Middle East region will be declared free of all nuclear\nand mass-destruction weapons.\n\nBy Ali Mutalq Al-Quhais Al-Shammari - AlReyadh Newspaper\n\nWhat comments do, Your Highness have about the rumors that Your Highness had a\nhealth problem lately? We pray God that the rumors were base less, and that He may\ngrant Your Highness good health, long life and happiness to make Your Highness a\nmodel to be followed in the region.\n\nI thank God that I am well and in the best of health and peace of mind and soul. The rumors about me are a part\nof the psychological war that was waged on Dubai in recent months. Rumors have never targeted unsuccessful,\nbackward or marginal people. I personally pay no attention to rumors, as I know they are short -lived. When\npeople find out the facts, they respect and appreciate you more; their good feelings toward you grow, and the\nrumor-mongers diminish in their eyes. In fact the last few months I have participated in 4 endurance races\nwhere I was able to race for more than 120km in each.\n\nBy Ali Mutalq Al-Quhais Al-Shammari - AlReyadh Newspaper\n\nBy the end of the first quarter of 2009, what is your evaluation of the economic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024955",
