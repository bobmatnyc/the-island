  "text": "Palestinians or with Syria in the foreseeable future. The Palestinians\nhave taken themselves out of the game for now. We cannot turn from\nthem to the Syrians while Assad’s troops are using howitzers and\nsniper rifles against his people. This is the time not for diplomatic\nengagement with Assad, but for diplomacy aimed at quarantining his\nregime and helping bring it down. The White House should dismiss\nany remaining dreams of a “peace process” with Syria to substitute\nfor the Palestinian version and face facts: There will be no peace with\nthe butcher who rules Syria today.\n\nElliott Abrams, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the\n\nCouncil on Foreign Relations, was a deputy national security adviser\nin the George W. Bush administration.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031838",
