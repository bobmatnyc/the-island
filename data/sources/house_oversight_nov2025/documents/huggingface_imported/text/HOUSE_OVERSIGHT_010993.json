  "text": "consumed bread, that is, every member of society, would from the same\noutlay have somewhat larger returns. The whole series of instruments\nowned by the society would be somewhat more productive, and would be\ncarried to an order of quicker returns.”\n\nThe clearest expression, and probably clearest even today, came from Mill in 1848.\nHe put it that output growth can precede and explain capital growth as well as the\n\nreverse. Crediting Rae, he wrote:\n\nThere are other cases in which the term saving, with the associations usually\nbelonging to it, does not exactly fit the operation by which capital is\nincreased. If it were said, for instance, that the only way to accelerate the\nincrease of capital is by increase of saving, the idea would probably be\nsuggested of greater abstinence, and increased privation. But itis obvious\nthat whatever increases the productive power of labor creates an additional\nfund to make savings from, and enables capital to be enlarged not only\nwithout additional privation, but concurrently with an increase of personal\nconsumption. Nevertheless, there is here an increase of saving, in the\nscientific sense. Though there is more consumed, there is also more spared.\nThere is a greater excess of production over consumption. It is consistent\nwith correctness to call this a greater saving. Though the term is not\nunobjectionable, there is no other which is not liable to as great objections.\nTo consume less than is produced, is saving; and that is the process by which\ncapital is increased; not necessarily by consuming less, absolutely. We must\nnot allow ourselves to be so much the slaves of words, as to be unable to use\nthe word saving in this sense, without being in danger of forgetting that to\nincrease capital there is another way besides consuming less, namely, to\nproduce more.\n\nThe words “accelerate” and “concurrently” show that Mill understood calculus. His\nautobiography says that he hadn’t really learned it from his father James, who had\nbought a book and was trying to teach himself and the 13-year old son at the same\ntime. The son studied it in his later teens at school in France. He like me was writing\nfor everyone, and preferred to keep explicit math off the page. But the quote\nreminds us that the only alternative in economics is implicit math in sentence form.\nThe paragraph implies the Y = C + I equation: output equals consumption plus\ninvestment. I go a tad farther, starting one chapter ago, by offsetting my word\n\nequations from the running text. These show equal signs and plus and minus and\n\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010993",
