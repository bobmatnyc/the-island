  "text": "European rates\n\nEUR (DE) 10-year (29 June): 1.6% (last month: 1.4%)\nUBS View EUR (DE) 10-year (6-month forecast): 1.7%\n¢ We believe the reasons for the recent rise in Bund yields are numerous: First, signs of more Eurozone\nintegration (e.g. European bank deposit guarantee) combined with the recapitalization of Spanish banks.\nSecond, the firm commitment of central banks to act if downside risks materialize (possible quantitative\neasing by the BoE and a higher probability of a ECB rate cut) and finally, Greek election results met\nexpectations. However, this rise was muted given the extension of Operation Twist, weak global / German\ndata and Spain's return to the spotlight.\n¢ Over a three- to six-month horizon, we expect growth momentum to remain subdued but still in positive\nterritory; we should have more information on how Spain and Italy are handling their adjustment\nprograms. Also, the new pro-memorandum Greek government should limit safe haven inflows, and thus\nlimit short-term downside risks to yields.\n¢ In the UK, economic data continues to be mixed as the recovery continues but is prone to external shocks.\nThe recent liquidity provision announcement by the BoE has confirmed these concerns.\ne In Switzerland, yields have traded range bound owing to conflicting economic data. The SNB stressed\nincreased downside risks to the economy and stands ready to act. However, we believe Swiss yields will\ngradually normalize.\n\nA Positive scenario for German bonds 10-year Bund yield (6-month range) 1.1-1.3%\ne The European debt crisis re-escalates. The resulting contagion would intensify the current flight to\nquality.\n¢ The economic recovery fails to gain momentum in the second half of the year. Credit demand fails to\nimprove further as some of the recent European Central Bank (ECB) data indicates. The ECB cuts rates.\n¢ Further quantitative easing by the Fed would be supportive for Bunds and speaks for lower yields.\n& Negative scenario for German bonds 10-year Bund yield (6-month range) 1.9-2.3%\n¢ A moderate Eurozone economic recovery kicks in, supporting debt-burdened Eurozone countries in their\nefforts to fulfill austerity commitments and thus reducing the demand for safe-haven assets. Alternatively,\nGermany gives additional guarantees and the Eurozone moves towards a transfer union.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nElections/EU fiscal The EU Summit will show if newly elected governments will change the dynamics\nconsolidation in the Eurozone.\n\nCentral banks The revival of the SMP program by the ECB would reduce the yields in the\nperiphery. Their assessments of the current economic situation can give hints of\nfurther rate cuts or quantitative easing measures. Key dates: 5 July, ECB rate\ndecision; 31 July, Fed FOMC meeting\n\nCredit conditions (ECB bank lending survey). Key date: 14 August, Eurozone\nGDP Q2\n\nThe level of yield spreads to German bonds influences the level of German Bund\nyields due to safe-haven flows.\n\nEconomic variables\n\nEurozone yield spreads\n\n36 UBS\n\nDuration preference: neutral\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne Long term Bund yields would fall lower,\nin case of rising Euro zone break up\nprobability. In contrast if Germany would\nneed to support the periphery further,\nBund yields would rise. We expect the\nmarket to oscillate between these two\ncases and recommend to stay neutral on\nduration tactically.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne Yields have significant upside potential\nover the next couple of years. Thus clients\nwith a long time horizon should focus on\nbonds with short and medium maturities.\n\nEU 10-year yields and forecasts\n5%\n4%\n3%\n2%\n\n1%\n\n0%\n\nJun-09 Jun-10 Jun-11 Jun-12 Jun-13\nforecasts — UK 10Y\nGermany 10Y — Switzerland 10Y\n\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS CIO, as of June 18t 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Daniela Steinbrink Mattei, daniela.steinbrinkmattei@ubs.com or Sebastian Vogel, sebastian.vogel@ubs.com,,\n\nor Nina Gotthelf, nina.gotthelf@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024160",
