Using\nmachine learning the techniques for vulnerability detection are increasingly sophisticated but opaque.\n\nAt some point adaptive cyber defense/offense systems become scalable so they can take over\nvulnerable systems. More aggressive actors combine these systems with botnet functionality and\nretaliatory responses (e.g. counter-hacking or DDoS attacks) to protect themselves. Since vulnerability\ndiscovery is scalable, as they spread and acquire more resources they become more effective. At this\npoint an external cause (e.g. cyberattacks due to an international conflict) or just chance cause\naggressive systems to begin large-scale cyberwarfare. This triggers other systems to join in. Some\nattacks disrupt command-and-control links, producing self-replicating independent systems.\n\nAll together this leads to a massive degradation of the functionality of the Internet and modern society.\nDefeating the evolving cyberwarfare systems is hard without taking essential parts of society offline for\nan extended time - made doubly difficult due to the international stresses unleashed by the outbreak,\nwhich in some cases spill over into real-world conflicts and economic crashes. But without a decisive\nway of cleaning systems the problem will be persistent until entirely new secure infrastructure can be\nbuilt at a great cost.\n\nHUMAN DIMENSION OF CYBERSECURITY: Al FOR SOCIAL ENGINEERING\n\nBeyond direct effects on computing systems, rising concerns include the use of Al methods for social\nengineering to gain access to system authentication information. For example, recent work\ndemonstrated the use of an iterative machine learning and optimization loop for spear phishing on\nTwitter. There are concerns with Al leveraging one of the weakest links in cybersecurity: people and\ntheir actions.\n\nDISCUSSION\n\nWhat are key threats ahead and how might they be addressed with new designs? How might we\nthwart the risk of Al for guiding “social engineering” of attacks and release of information? What are\nconcrete proposals for best practices for thwarting Al for cyberattacks, including highlighting of areas\nwhere more research is needed?\n\nREFERENCES\nSinger and Friedman. 2014.
