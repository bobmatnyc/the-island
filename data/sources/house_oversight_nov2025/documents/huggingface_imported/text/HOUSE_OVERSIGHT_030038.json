  "text": "B\n\nRight now, nobody has a successful formula for helping Pakistan —\nwith its 100-plus nuclear weapons — arrest its systemic decline; or\nfor coercing North Korea to slow its growing nuclear weapons and\nmissile capabilities. So the administration gets the benefit of the\ndoubt on those two perplexing problems.\n\nObama has, however, failed in the most important presidential power:\nto act as a wise commander in chief. He is seriously mismanaging all\nthree wars the U.S. is now engaged in.\n\nIn Iraq, over the past decade, the United States has lost 4,500\nAmerican lives, has had 33,000 wounded and has spent a trillion\ndollars to promote vital U.S. national interests. But we are in danger\nof losing that enormous sacrifice in blood and treasure to meet the\npresident’s deadline of withdrawing all U.S. troops by the end of this\nyear.\n\nThat is a huge strategic mistake. It could, over time, plunge that\npivotal nation back into civil war. We should keep roughly 40,000\ncombat troops in Iraq for the foreseeable future, to make an\nindispensable contribution to [raq’s stability and prevent Iranian\ndominance. We should now be lobbying the Iraqi government hard to\naccept this.\n\nIn Afghanistan, Obama has dramatically escalated U.S. troop\ncommitment — now more than 100,000 — in a war that Bob\nWoodward says in his book, “Obama’s Wars,” that the president does\nnot believe in. U.S. policy toward Afghanistan involves spending\n$100 billion and suffering several hundred allied deaths annually —\n500 Americans dead last year, thousands more injured. All this to\ndeal with 100 or so Al Qaeda fighters now in Afghanistan; and\nprevent the Afghan Taliban from controlling the Pashtun Afghan\nhomeland — which was not the reason we went there after Sept. 11.\nOur mission was to eradicate Al Qaeda — now largely accomplished —\nnot fight the Taliban.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030038",
