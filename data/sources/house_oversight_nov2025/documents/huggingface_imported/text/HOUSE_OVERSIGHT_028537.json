  "text": "So, they have said, they negotiated a deal, allowing Epstein to plead guilty in Palm Beach\nCounty Circuit Court to one count of soliciting a minor for prostitution and another charge\nof soliciting prostitution. In exchange, federal prosecutors agreed to close their investigation.\nThey have said they had no idea Epstein would only serve 13 months of an 18-month\nsentence in a vacant wing of the county stockade — a cell he was allowed to leave 16 hours\na day, six days a week.\n\nWhile voicing dismay at his lax punishment, prosecutors have pointed out that the plea deal\nrequired Epstein to pay the roughly 30 young women who filed civil lawsuits against him.\nFurther, they said his guilty pleas force him to register as a sex offender for the rest of his\nlife, potentially protecting other girls from abuse in the future.\n\nHowever, over the years, they have never suggested that Epstein provided them any\ninformation in return.\n\nLike Edwards, two people close to the long-closed federal investigation said they were\nflummoxed by the sentence in the FBI’s memo that was written in September 2008, roughly\ntwo months after Epstein pleaded guilty in state court.\n\n“T have never, ever heard of Jeffrey Epstein cooperating in any sense of the word,” said one\nofficial, who requested anonymity because of the top role the person played in the\ninvestigation. “I am stumped. It’s totally out of left field.”\n\nAnother individual with ties to the case voiced similar views. Epstein may have been\nrequired to talk to FBI agents but it’s unlikely he offered anything that would incriminate\nothers, said the person, who declined to be identified because of ongoing efforts to help\nEpstein’s victims challenge the plea deal. “I don’t think he ever told the truth,” the person\nsaid.\n\nA lawsuit Edwards filed against the federal government, claiming prosecutors violated the\nVictims Rights Act by not notifying Epstein’s victims of the pending plea deal, is still\npending in U.S. District Court. Also, awaiting trial in Palm Beach County Circuit Court is a\nmalicious prosecution lawsuit Edwards filed against Epstein. Edwards claims the billionaire\nfiled a frivolous lawsuit to punish Edwards for representing a handful of Epstein’s young\nvictims.\n\nWest Palm Beach attorney Jack Goldberger, who was on Epstein’s potent defense team, said\nhe was “unable to respond” to questions about the FBI’s memo. Other prominent lawyers\nwho represented Epstein, including New York lawyer Jay Lefkowitz and retired Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershowitz, didn’t respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe one line was part of a brief missive dated Sept. 18, 2008, closing the case: “On 9/11/08,\ncase agent advised writer that Epstein is currently being prosecuted by the State of Florida\nand is complying with all conditions of his plea with the State of Florida. Epstein has also\nprovided information to the FBI as agreed upon. Case agent advised that no federal\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028537",
