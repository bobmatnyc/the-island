But in the ideological dialect of the\nCommunist Party, it seems to mean several things. First, that there is nothing random about\nwhat is unfolding in the world today. Second, these reflect certain immutable laws of political\nand economic development. Third, the business of Chinese foreign policy is to use this dialectal\nprism to understand precisely what is happening in the world today, why it is happening and\nwhat to do about it. And fourth, applying these disciplines to the current period, it means that\nthe global order is at a turning point with the relative decline of the US and the West, with\nthis coinciding with the fortuitous national and international circumstances currently enabling\nChina’s rise.\n\nTo use Xi’s own language, this: “has been in the best period of development since modern\ntimes, while the world is undergoing the most profound and unprecedented changes in a\ncentury” adding that “the two aspects are intertwined and interact with each other.” Xi refers\nto the current period as a period of unprecedented strategic opportunity for China and the\ncurrent mission of the party. Although this is not itself a new term, Xi says the party’s mission\nis to extend this period. To do this, he calls for the party to engage in “in-depth analysis of\nthe law of how the international situation changes as the world comes into this transitional\nperiod, as well as developing an accurate grasp of the basic characteristics of the external\nenvironment China is facing at this historical juncture in order to better plan and facilitate the\ncountry's work on foreign affairs.”\n\nIn other words, what is being said here is that China now has the wind at its back. Of course\nthere are formidable obstacles ahead. But a dialectical analysis of history causes China to\nconclude that the forces of reaction facing the US and the West are greater. Just as the\ncontradictions operating domestically within the US and the West (in their particular political\nsystems) are greater as well. Which in turn renders China’s overall domestic and international\ncircumstances much better by comparison in the emerging contest between the two. All of\nwhich, again in this view, pushes towards a new historical synthesis more in China’s (and\nChinese socialism’s) favour.\n\nYou will all be forgiven if you think this all sounds more like medieval theology than modern\ninternational relations. And it’s anyone’s guess what any of this actually will have to do with\nconcrete foreign policy reality. But we often forget that how one-party states, and in particular\nMarxist states, choose to ‘ideate’ reality actually matters. It’s how the system speaks to itself.\nIt’s the political lingua franca among political and policy elites.\n\nAnd the important thing here is that the message from Xi Jinping to his international policy\nelite is one of great confidence. Not just because China wills it to be so, but because from a\n\nMarxist theoretical perspective, which in their view articulates certain immutable ‘laws’ of\npolitical and economic development, the forces of history are now with China.
