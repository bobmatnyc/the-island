  "text": "negotiations have been underway, with significant progress attained on the\nmajority of the chapters of the Cyprus problem as a result of the intensive\nefforts put forward by the two sides in reaching convergences.\nFurthermore, with the recent agreement on the Joint Declaration of\nFebruary 11, 2014, an important milestone in the negotiations has been\nreached, which clearly provides for the broad outline of a solution and the\nmain principles upon which the new partnership will be established.\nHence, the announcement of the Joint Declaration triggered a very\npositive atmosphere that was further fostered by the support of a wide\nspectrum of actors on both sides as well as the extensive espousal received\nby the international community.\n\nThe Far-Reaching Consequences of the Problem\n\nIn light of this promising political climate on the island, combined with\nthe existence of some external factors that are currently at play, there is an\nhistoric opportunity that should not be missed in bringing the long-\noverdue Cyprus problem to a closure.
