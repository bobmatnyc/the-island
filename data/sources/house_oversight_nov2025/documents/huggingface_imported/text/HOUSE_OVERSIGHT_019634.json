  "text": "146 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nmultibillion-dollar enterprise of outsourcing the management of the\nNSA’s computer networks and other technical work to outside con-\ntractors. It also casts doubts on the post-9/11 decision by the intel-\nligence community to strip away much of the NSA’s “stovepiping”\nthat previously insulated its most sensitive computers. Without\nsuch stovepiping, any rogue civilian employee could bring down the\nentire edifice of shared intelligence.\n\nA finding that Snowden had acted in concert with others in breach-\ning compartments at the NSA would hardly be any more reassuring.\nSuch collaboration among intelligence workers would reflect gravely\non the mind-set of the NSA. Snowden described an atmosphere in\nwhich intelligence workers exchanged lewd photographs of foreign\nsuspects. Some NSA employees met to protest the NSA policies. Did\nthis violation of the NSA‘s rules also involve abetting the theft of\ndocuments? If so, the NSA would have to evaluate further vulner-\nabilities that might arise when it entrusts its secrets to technicians\nwho do not share its values. A collaborative breach would signal an\nimmense failure of the present concept of the counterintelligence\n\n© regime in the NSA. ©\n\nFrom what I gathered from government officials who were famil-\niar with the investigation, there was a concern that answering the\n“how” question would rouse serious doubts about the very ability\nof the NSA to carry out its core mission of protecting the govern-\nment’s intelligence secrets. However it was organized, it was clear\nthat Snowden had played a major role in what amounted to a bril-\nliant intelligence coup.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 146 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019634",
