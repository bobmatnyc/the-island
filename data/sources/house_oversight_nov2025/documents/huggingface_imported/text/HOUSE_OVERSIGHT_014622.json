As Michael\nHartnett pointed out, 2016 saw global interest rates fall to 5,000-year lows and the\nlikely end of what has been the greatest bull market in bonds ever. We experienced a\nhistoric US Presidential election and Republican sweep of Congress on November 9th.\nLater that same month, OPEC reached a historic deal to reduce crude production by\n1.2mn b/d with non-OPEC producers delivering an additional 600k b/d of cuts – the first\nsuch joint curb since 1998. Risk assets responded with 30-year Treasury reaching a\nyield of 2.088% in July, US equity markets reaching all-time highs, and oil prices rallying\nmore than 40% since the start of the year. Given the Republican sweep - and the\nresulting likelihood that the logjam of Washington gridlock will be broken - our Top 10\nstock selections are more heavily geared toward companies that may benefit from\nincreased fiscal stimulus, a more pro-business agenda, and/or tax-policy reform. Our\ncurrent strategy stands in stark contrast to our stance last year of looking for defensive\ngrowth ideas.\nUnited States\nAlpha Generation Research\nMLPF&S\nAnthony Cassamassino\nStrategist\nMLPF&S\n+1 212 449 6874\nanthony.cassamassino@baml.com\nDerek Harris\nStrategist\nMLPF&S\n+1 646 743 0218\nderek.harris@baml.com\nEight Buys and two Underperforms\nOur 1Q17 list includes eight Buys and two Underperforms across six sectors.

The list\nreflects primarily a bottoms-up approach, with calendar-specific events noted for most\nstocks. We constructed our list by canvassing BofAML Fundamental Equity Research\nanalysts in order to find 10 BofAML-covered stocks which we think will significantly\noutperform or underperform peers during the quarter. We considered only Buy-rated\nnames for outperform ideas and Underperform-rated names for underperform ideas. We\nthen narrowed the list after consulting our Equity Research colleagues.\nTo be eligible for the list, the stock must be covered by BofA Merrill Lynch AMRS\nfundamental equity analysts with a rating of Buy or Underperform, for long and short\nstock recommendations, respectively.\nStocks will be chosen on a discretionary basis by the Alpha Generation team, which\ncurrently includes strategists with experience choosing stocks for BofAML’s US 1 list.\nStocks will be chosen for the list using a bottoms-up approach after taking into account\nthe views of the relevant BofA Merrill Lynch Fundamental Equity analyst and upcoming\ncatalysts. Diversity of the list and BofAML macro views will also be factors in choosing\nstocks for the list.\nStocks on the list will generally remain on the list during the quarter. However, a stock\nwill be removed interim quarter if considered ineligible due to a change in the stock’s\nfundamental rating, or if the stock is no long covered by BofA Merrill Lynch fundamental\nEquity Research.

PF 2018 earnings\nshould be close to $11.50 (vs $9.70 consensus), even before taking into account the\nupside from tax reform (+15% to EPS) and rising interest rates (+5%). In the event that\nthe deal breaks, we see little downside and potential upside in 1Q17 in the form of\ncapital deployment (AET remains underlevered and in the absence of a deal could look to\naggressively repurchase stock). Current estimates do not include share repurchase and\nbased on its history of repurchasing shares using free cash flow and its balance sheet\ncapacity, we expect AET to repurchase a significant amount (~10%) of its shares in\n2017 post deal break, providing initial downside support and ultimately driving upside to\nStreet estimates.\nTable 1: Aetna key stock data\nIndustry\nManaged Care\nMarket Cap (mn) $44,657\nPrice $124.45\nP/E (2017) 14.4x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 70.0%\nShort interest % of float 2.25%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nDeregulation/Gov’t Legislation: Repeal and Replace of the ACA creates some\nuncertainty, but neither AET nor HUM derive a significant amount of EPS from the ACA.\nMeanwhile, Republicans have historically supported Medicare Advantage (80% of HUM’s\nrevenue), and we expect a stronger rate environment under this Administration than\nover the past 8 years.\nTax Policy: As a domestic only company with a relatively high tax rate (est. 35% in\n2017), AET would benefit from tax reform. We believe that some benefit would be lost\nto minimum MLR rebates or competition, but if taxes are lowered 15%, then we assume\nthat they keep about 2/3 of the benefit (19% to EPS).\nCatalysts: Deal resolution, capital allocation update, tax reform, rising interest rates.\nLatest report: MCO rally has just begun; beneficiaries of the non-Health\nCare upside from Trump\n1Q risks: Risks to the downside are courts not approving the HUM acquisition, lowerthan-expected\nmembership growth and higher than expected cost trend. CMS will issue\nthe rate update for 2018 for Medicare Advantage in late February, a reg which we\nexpect to be benign, but which could be worse than expected.\nCompany Description: Aetna is one of the nation's largest managed care organizations,\ncovering roughly 23 million members. The company focuses on three main business\nsegments: Health Care (health insurance, dental, behavioral health and pharmacy benefit\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 3\nproducts), Group Insurance (including life, disability and long term care insurance\nproducts) and Large Case Pension (a legacy business which is largely in runoff).\nDover (DOV)\nAndrew Obin +1 646 855 1817\nResearch Analyst, MLPF&S\nBuy, PO $85\n1Q investment thesis\nWe think the Street is underestimating ’17 EPS upside potential from Energy recovery\ngiven the segment’s close correlation to N.A. rig count and short-cycle nature of the\nbusiness, as well as incremental accretion from Wayne acquisition. DOV is expected to\nhost an analyst dinner on January 12 th which will provide a 4Q update and preview 2017\nresults. We think the meeting will be a positive catalyst for the stock, providing more\nvisibility on Energy orders post-OPEC meeting, highlighting sustainability of the EMV\ncycle in Wayne into ’19. Investors will also likely get an update on execution turnaround\nin the Refrigeration business, removing one of the biggest overhangs on the stock.\nTable 1: Dover key stock data\nIndustry\nIndustrial Machinery\nMarket Cap (mn) $11,921\nPrice $75.19\nP/E (2017) 19.6x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 25.0%\nShort interest % of float 1.54%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nDeregulation/Gov’t Legislation:\nWe expect Trump’s administration to prioritize US energy independence, with\nderegulation benefiting domestic shale produces, which should be an attractive tailwind\nto DOV’s Energy segment.\nTax Policy:\nOur estimates are based on 29% tax rate in ‘17/18. We calculate that under Ryan’s\nproposed plan, we can see about 19% upside to EPS. We estimate that under Trump’s\nproposed plan, we can see about 24% upside to EPS.\nCatalysts:\nJanuary 12 th – investor dinner with management\nJanuary 26 th – 4Q results\nRig count release\nLatest report: Dover Corp: Adjusting for Wayne, EMV cycle extension; Rig\ncount going up, LII read-across\n1Q risks: With so much of DOV’s EPS upside tied to Energy segment recovery, we view\noil price volatility (from stronger US$ or other unexpected macro headlines) as the\nbiggest risk to our thesis. Weaker-than-expected execution in Refrigeration or Fluid\nbusiness would be another risk, offsetting Energy upside.\n4 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nCompany Description: Dover is a diversified, global manufacturer of industrial products.\nIt comprises more than 30 independent companies that operate in four segments:\nRefrigeration & Food Equipment, Fluids, Energy, and Engineered Systems.\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\nRonald Epstein +1 646 855 5695\nResearch Analyst, MLPF&S\nBuy, PO $200\n1Q investment thesis\nGeneral Dynamics is a defensive large cap value stock with potential cyclical growth.\nThe company has a history of annual dividend increases with a dividend yield of 1.7%.\nConcerns about weakening demand for Gulfstream business jets in General Dynamic’s\nAerospace segment have weighed down sentiment. However, using a sum-of-the-parts\nanalysis that values GD’s defense businesses in line with the pure play defense average,\nthis would imply that GD’s Aerospace segment is trading at a significant discount to the\nmarket at 12x P/E multiple on 2018E earnings. Considering the strength in Gulfstream’s\nproduct portfolio and margin performance, we would expect Aerospace to trade at least\nat 18x P/E multiple on 2018E earnings.\nTable 1: General Dynamics key stock data\nIndustry\nAerospace & Defense\nMarket Cap (mn) $57,215\nPrice $173.21\nP/E (2017)* 17.9x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 76.2%\nShort interest % of float 1.02%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nGov’t Legislation: 56% of sales are from the US government\nGeneral Dynamics’ primary customer is the US Department of Defense, which accounted\nfor 47% of total sales in 2015. The remaining 9% are to other non-DoD US government\nagencies like the intelligence community. For the military, which is a defensive sector,\nGD is engaged in engineering, manufacturing, and support of land and expeditionary\ncombat vehicles and systems, armaments, munitions, and shipbuilding and marine\nsystems. Major products include Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarine and Ohio\nclass ballistic nuclear submarine replacement, Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyer,\nAbrams M1A2 tank, Stryker 8-wheeled assault vehicle, medium-caliber munitions and\ngun systems, tactical and strategic mission systems. The company also provides\ninformation systems and technologies.\nDisruptor: Gulfstream G650 has unrivaled performance in the most profitable\nbusiness jet market segment\nThere is no direct competitor aircraft currently in service in the market to match the\nperformance of the Gulfstream G650/650ER. The G650ER has a range of 7,500 nautical\nmiles at Mach 0.85, but can fly faster at Mach 0.90 with a range of 6,400 nautical miles.\nThe Dassault Falcon 8X has a range of only 6,450 nautical miles. Meanwhile,\nBombardier’s response to the G650 has been delayed another year with the entry into\nservice of the Global 7000 (range of 7,300 nautical miles) in 2H18. Gulfstream book-tobill\nin 3Q16 was 1:1 on a dollar value basis and 1.2:1 on an aircraft unit basis. In our\nview, market share gains in a soft demand environment could provide Gulfstream a solid\nfoundation to bridge the Gulfstream G450/550 to the G500/600.\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 5\nCatalysts: Stable Aerospace earnings & US defense spending\nOperating weakness for Bombardier’s Global family, which competes with the\nGulfstream family, has weighed down investor sentiment for large cabin business jets\nand General Dynamics. However, Gulfstream’s more conservative production rates,\nattractive product positioning, higher quality backlog, and better operating performance\ncompared to Bombardier lower Gulfstream’s near- and medium-term earnings risks, in\nour view. The key catalyst for General Dynamics is the upcoming earnings result that\ndemonstrates how EBIT in the Aerospace segment remains stable despite a more tepid\nmarket outlook from Bombardier.\nWe continue to view GD as a beneficiary of positive inflection in US defense spending.\nWe expect the recent Republican victory in the White House and the Senate to be seen\nas incrementally positive for defense. Political control is a key driver of defense\nspending, and defense stock valuations are tied to changes in defense spending related\nto the modernization accounts. Our Political Control Model (PCM) analysis highlights a\nRepublican President and Republican Senate is the best case for Budget Authority in\ndefense modernization accounts. Our PCM analysis suggests that the Republican sweep\ncould increase the Budget Authority for defense investment accounts by a CAGR of 12-\n13% (FY17E-21E). This compares to the BofAML forecast of a 5% CAGR and the FY17\nGreen Book forecast of a 1% CAGR.\nAdditionally, GD’s Marine Systems segment is a direct beneficiary of the US pivot to the\nPacific. The Pacific is a hotbed of maritime activity particularly as China expands its\nterritorial waters. As the US focus on naval superiority strengthens, we might see upside\nto shipbuilding spending.\nLatest report: General Dynamics: Gulfstream still undervalued; raise PO to\n$200 and reiterate Buy 30 November 2016\n1Q risks: large cabin business jets market deterioration and US defense spending\nThere is risk of market deterioration in large cabin business jets that could increase\nearnings risks for Gulfstream. Additionally, delays in government contracting or lower\nthan expected increase in US defense spending could provide downside risks to our\nestimates.\nCompany Description\nGeneral Dynamics is a major US government contractor engaged in combat vehicles and\nsystems, armaments, munitions, ordnance, shipbuilding and information systems and\ntechnologies.

To offset this slow growth, ConEd has been increasing the complexity of its\nbusiness by purchasing gas and electric transmission assets which have higher growth\npotential but face more market risk (most notably the JV with Crestwood in the\nStagecoach midstream pipeline system). Furthermore, the regulatory regime in New\nYork is undergoing a fundamental shift as the Reforming Energy Vision (REV) program is\nimplemented. REV seeks to fundamentally change how utilities are compensated by\ncreating more of a ‘platform’ for energy delivery. Slow growth, changing business mix,\nand new regulatory constructs add considerable risk to what used to be a “go to” vanilla\nregulated utility.\nAn overvalued Sector and Potential Catalysts\nFor a long time, ConEd was viewed as the quintessential utility and, during the run-up in\nUtility valuations in 2016 its shares outperformed despite its weakening fundamentals.\nAs the story becomes more complex and the utility sector adjusts to lower valuation we\nwould expect ED to underperform with a similar symmetry to other utility stocks.\nLatest reports:\nRecent BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Reports\nTitle: Subtitle Primary Author Date Published\nUtilities: Fed promises more hikes; utes face more downside Brian Chin 15 December 2016\nrisk in early 2017\nUtilities: Alternating Currents Weekly Brian Chin 18 December 2016\n1Q17 risks: Risks to our thesis are primarily macro related.

Along with the tailwind from\nrenewed OPEC support for oil prices, we view the broader energy sector as a\nmomentum play in the early part of 2017 where stock specific catalysts can re-emerge\nto differentiate relative performance within the large cap US oils. We view Hess as the\nmost catalyst rich large cap US E&P for 2017 with a return to growth and\ndisproportionate exploration risk from a company with the highest cash margins in the\nsector, second best balance sheet and significant oil leverage to our base case that is an\noil recovery in 2017.

The exception is the potential for more receptive backdrop\nfor infrastructure development that can improve regional pricing through improved\naccess to takeaway capacity.\nTax Policy:\nFor the majority of the US E&P’s, changes in corporate tax rates have negligible impact\ngiven that substantial net operating losses and deferred tax credits means that cash\ntaxes remain de minimis for the foreseeable future.\nCatalysts:\nNews flow starts with an expected capex budget unchanged from 2016 at ~$2bn, the\ncompany has stated it expects a return to drilling in the Bakken with a stated ramp up to\n6 rigs from 2 currently returning the play to growth in 2017..

The potential for negative impacts from\nmandatory open access and rate of return calculation adjustments may be reduced given\nthe change of administration, which would be a positive for the railroad group.\nTax Policy:\nGiven their domestic focus, Transportation companies are the highest effective tax\npayers in the Industrial and Basic Materials group, with the U.S.-based railroads\naveraging a 37% effective tax rate. At a 20% tax-rate, EPS would jump nearly 30%\n(though full capex expensing could reduce EBIT to offset a sizeable portion of the gain).\nAdditionally, cross-border tax increasing cost of goods sold for manufacturing goods\ncould slow GDP, impacting carload growth over time.\nCatalysts:\nNear term catalysts include accelerating carload growth, coal turning positive for the rail\nindustry this week, after 90 consecutive down weeks, and NS’s upcoming January\npromise for additional details on its targeted efficiency gains. The company is set to\npost a sub-70% operating ratio for only the 2 nd time in the past 20 years, a target we\nwould expect to improve further in 2017 and beyond.\nLatest report: Raise estimates and PO to $122; Volumes trending above\ntarget\nOctober Upgrade report: Time to look at things differently; Raise to Buy\n1Q risks: Norfolk Southern has posted 9 consecutive weeks of carload growth,\nindicating underlying economic growth, with relatively easy comps into 1H17. Thus, risk\nincludes carload growth slowing or turning back negative, as well as increased concern\non macro GDP growth rates given fear about new fiscal policies (cross-border tax, full\ncapex expensing) which could compress EPS. Additionally, if the expected discussion on\nefficiency gain details in January is not provided as expected, investors could lose\nconfidence that management will stick with and/or meet its 2020 target. Additionally, if\ncorporate tax reform is not passed, multiples that have expanded on some reduced tax\nrate could re-compress.\nCompany Description: Norfolk Southern Railway operates a 21,300 route mile railroad\nnetwork in 22 eastern states, District of Columbia, and Ontario, Canada. We target it to\ngenerate $10 billion in 2016 revenues and a sub-70% operating ratio (hitting that target\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 11\nfor only the 2 nd time in the past 20 years). We target it to move 7.22 million carloads in\n2016, with an average revenue per car of $1,371. Coal represents 14% of total\nrevenues, down from 36% 2 years prior. Intermodal represents 22% of revenues, and\nAg/Consumer/Gov’t represents 16% of revenues.\nSVB Financial Group (SIVB)\nEbrahim H. Poonawala +1 646 743 0490\nResearch Analyst, MLPF&S\nBuy, PO $190\n1Q investment thesis\nWe view SIVB as the best positioned bank in our coverage universe by a wide margin to\nbenefit from the combination of 1) rising interest rates – with SIVB ranking among the\nmost rate sensitive banks in the mid-cap banks group 2) stronger economic growth -\nwith SIVB's 2017 guidance (issued before the US elections) already calling for double\ndigit revenue growth 3) de-regulation 4) tax reform. Our '17e EPS of $9 and '18e EPS of\n$12 imply YoY EPS growth of 24% and 33% respectively. SIVB trades at 18x our '17e\nEPS and 2x YE17e TBV. Our PO of $190 implies P/'17e EPS of 20x (and 16x ‘18e EPS)\nand P/YE17e TBV of 2.4x. This compares to an average P/E of 22.7x and P/TBV of 2.6x\nthat the stock traded at heading into and during the initial stages of the 2004-2006\ninterest rate cycle.\nTable 1: SIVB key stock data\nIndustry\nCommercial Banks\nMarket Cap (mn) $8,584\nPrice $170.38\nP/E (2017) 19.1x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 77.8%\nShort interest % of float 4.68%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nDeregulation/Gov’t Legislation: Among the one legislative action on the regulatory\nfront that appears likely to be passed under the new administration is the increase in\nthe $50bn SIFI asset threshold which brings with a heightened level of regulatory\nscrutiny (such as undergoing the CCAR stress test). While we were not concerned about\nSIVB's ability to transition into a CCAR bank, the removal of this should no doubt serve\nas a positive. At $43bn in assets, becoming a CCAR bank had been weighing on investor\nsentiment. With expectations for this threshold to be pushed higher, this should no\nlonger be a significant concern when thinking about SIVB's growth trajectory. Another\nissue that has not been discussed much but could occur is any changes in the Volcker\nrule that would allow the bank to once again participate in investing capital in PE/VC\nfunds. We view this restriction as an unintended consequence on SIVB stemming from\nthe Volcker rule and the ability once again participate in these funds would be a\nsignificant positive given the potential for getting equity exposure in the early stages of\nthe life cycle of start-up companies.\nTax Policy: With SIVB paying an effective tax rate of 40.6% in 2016 YTD, the bank will\nundoubtedly be a beneficiary from a lower corporate tax rate. While we believe it is too\nsoon to adjust estimates for this, we note that a 500bp reduction in the tax rate would\nequate to 8.4% upside to SIVB's 2018 EPS estimate. Moreover, the potential for\nhundreds of billion dollars in tax repatriation by the US tech giants also augurs well for\ngreasing the wheels for the start-up sector. While some of this repatriated capital will\nno doubt go to buy backs and higher dividends, we expect some of this to flow into the\nstart-up space as tech giants pursue M&A. At the very least it mitigates the risk of any\n12 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nsignificant credit issues for the banks as weaker firms (who are clients) will be better\npositioned to sell themselves to the tech behemoths looking for innovative ideas.\nCatalysts: 1) Improving expectations around rising rates (on back of better macroeconomic\ndata) will continue to serve as a tailwind for the stock 2) A strong tech IPO\nmarket – as SIVB stands to benefit from equity exposure to 1000+ start-up companies\n3) Clarity around a tax reform bill once the new administration takes office in January\nshould lead to the markets pricing-in a lift to forward EPS and 4) updated 2017\nguidance could reflect a stronger outlook vs. management’s preliminary guidance\nprovided in Oct 2016.\nLatest report: On its way to regaining its premium multiple\n1Q risks: Downside risks are 1) reversal in the outlook for higher rates 2) a sharp selloff\nin the equity markets that could derail IPO activity and 3) disappointment on the\npace of policy actions under the new administration.\nCompany Description: SVB Financial Group is a financial holding company that serves\ncompanies in the technology, life science, venture capital, private equity and premium\nwine industries.

The company has been one of the\nlargest share gainers in industrial/auto semis entering a seasonally strong period for\nspending. Unlike peers, Texas instruments has no distraction from M&A while\nmaintaining a grossly under-levered balance sheet (<0.1x net debt/EBITDA vs comps at\n2x-4x). We expect TXN to continue to generate industry leading FCF while growing its\ndividend at 20%+ CAGR. We look toward the strategy update call in early February as\nthe next catalyst for the stock.\nTable 1: Texas Instruments key stock data\nIndustry\nSemiconductors\nMarket Cap (mn) $73,899\nPrice $74.15\nP/E (2017) 20.1x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 35.3%\nShort interest % of float 1.75%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\nDeregulation/Gov’t Legislation: 60% of TXN’s sales are exposed to the industrial,\nautomotive, and communications equipment end markets. We think these markets could\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 13\nsee the most uplift in spending from any potentially large fiscal stimulus and\ninfrastructure spending under the new US administration.\nTax Policy: Unlike most semis, TXN reports its financials on a pure GAAP basis and its\ntax rate at 30% is one of the highest in the industry. We think TXN stands to\ndisproportionately benefit from the looser tax policies foreshadowed by the upcoming\nadministration. Specifically, a 10% drop in the corporate tax rate would lead to 15%\nhigher EPS for TXN in 2017, all else equal.\nCatalysts: (1) Seasonally stronger period for industrial/automotive spending – 46% of\nTXN’s revenue come from these end markets; (2) Annual strategy and capital allocation\npolicy update call with shareholders which is likely to occur at the beginning of February.\nLatest report: The new \"industrials\": growth recovery plus pricing power,\nBuy TXN, ADI, MCHP, ON\n1Q risks: (1) Still somewhat large (>10%) exposure to consumer electronics could create\nnear-term volatility in topline results; (2) Historically lumpy communications equipment\nspending trends; (3) Larger than expected slowdown in North America automotive unit\nproduction\nCompany Description: Texas Instruments is a broad-based supplier of semiconductor\ncomponents, ranging from digital signal processors, to high-performance analog\ncomponents, to digital light-processing technology and calculators. 65% of TXN sales\nare exposed to the well diversified, business-to-business Industrial, Automotive,\nCommunications Infrastructure, and Enterprise markets.\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\nNat Schindler +1 415 676 3574\nResearch Analyst, MLPF&S\nUnderperform, PO $41\n1Q investment thesis\nDespite easier y/y comps in 2017, we see risk that Click-based & Transaction Hotel\nrevenue continues to decline as 1) higher monetizing desktop traffic structurally\ndeclines, 2) mobile monetization remains at 30% of desktop traffic and is unlikely to\nmeaningfully close the gap, and 3) Instant Book is unlikely to help reverse the revenue\nand earnings trend. At the same time, TRIP has been accelerating marketing spend,\nimplying increasing acquisition costs, with further ad spend ramp in ‘17. TRIP noted\n2017 EBITDA margin will decline further from 2016 levels as ad spend ticks up to reaccelerate\ngrowth.\nTable 1: TripAdvisor key stock data\nIndustry\nOnline Travel\nMarket Cap (mn) $9,071\nPrice $46.95\nP/E (2017) 32.5x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 14.3%\nShort interest % of float 10.30%\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\n14 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nTax Policy: TRIP has a ~25% tax rate. Trump’s tax plan calls for a reduction in the\nbusiness tax rate from 35% to 15%, with elimination of most corporate tax\ndeductions/credits (except for the R&D credit). While it’s unclear what elements of the\ntax plan will eventually be executed, Trump’s intent is clear and we believe companies\nwith the highest tax rate have the most to gain. We see less incremental benefit to\nmany of the global companies who already enjoy optimized tax rates (22% average tax\nrate across our coverage), but many companies will have more incentive to bring back\nIntl profits for buybacks with lower US tax rates.\nCatalysts: 4Q’16 Earnings (early February) will feature initial 2017 guidance. TripAdvisor\nnoted on the 3Q’16 earnings call that 2017 EBITDA margin will decline further from\n2016 levels as ad spend ticks up to re-accelerate growth, however it is unclear how\nmuch margin deterioration TripAdvisor will guide to. We think the deterioration in the\nguide will be higher than the Street’s expectations, driving further downside estimate\nrevisions.\nLatest report: TripAdvisor: 2017 PM Level Outlook\n1Q risks: There is downside risk to Street estimates if hotel shopper growth comes in\nbelow expectations, mobile monetization gap widens, and if initial 2017 guidance\ndisappoints. We remain cautious on IB as an attempt to solve a very large problem: the\ncontinued transition of users consuming TripAdvisor’s content on their mobile phones\ninstead of their desktops. On mobile phones, users are much less likely to transact or\nclick on an ad than on desktops.\nA risk to the short thesis: There has been frequent speculation in the press that\nTripAdvisor may be a takeout candidate in the rapidly consolidating online travel market,\nwith Priceline frequently named as the likely suitor.\nCompany Description: TripAdvisor is the largest global online travel media company\nwith over millions of members and hundreds of millions of user reviews. The company's\nportfolio of web properties attracts over 300 million unique visitors per month\nworldwide.\nPrice objective basis & risk\nAetna Inc (AET)\nOur Price Objective of $149 is based on a 50/50 blend of our standalone AET valuation\n($138, 13.1x 2018E EPS of $10.50 when including share repurchase) and AET pro forma\nHUM valuation ($160, 14x 2018E EPS of $11.40). Our AET standalone valuation multiple\nreflects AET's historical average discount to the S&P 500. Our AET pro forma HUM\nvaluation multiple of 14x reflects upside levers to HUM synergy guidance and to reflect\nthe improved long-term growth profile of the company. Risks to the upside are\nregulatory approval of the HUM acquisition, better-than-expected membership growth\nand lower than expected cost trend. Risks to the downside are regulators not approving\nthe HUM acquisition, lower-than-expected membership growth and higher than\nexpected cost trend.\nConsolidated Edison (ED)\nOur price objective of $59 is predicated on shares of ED achieving 13.0x our 2019 EPS\nestimate. We apply the current group average multiple of 13.5x and apply a 0.5x\ndiscount to reflect a well below average ROE, a slightly below average growth profile,\nand a relatively challenging regulatory environment. This is offset slightly by a lower risk\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 15\nprofile investment outlook. Upside risks to our thesis could stem from more favorable\nchanges to the investment and/or regulatory environment in New York.\nDownside/upside risks: ED, like all utility stocks, is also sensitive to changes in the\nmarket level of interest rates. Utilities historically underperform if bond yields rise, and\noutperform when they fall. Furthermore, ED is a bellwether utility and has historically\noutperformed during market uncertainty as a large liquid \"flight to safety\" stock.\nDover Corp (DOV)\nOur PO of $85 is based on 11.5x EV/EBITDA on our 2017 estimate, which would put\nDOV in line with the multi-industrial peer group average. We view the target multiple as\nconservative, as we expect the Street to focus on EPS growth upside in '17, driven by\nEnergy coming off depressed profitability.\nRisks to our PO are: 1) Highly dependent on acquisition strategy, 2) A reduction in\ncapital spending in the oil & gas market, and 3) Weak global industrial production\ngrowth.\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\nWe derive our PO of $200 using a sum-of-the-parts valuation model. Our model factors\nin 19.5x P/E multiple on 2018E earnings for GD's defense business, which is in line with\npure play defense peers, and 18x P/E multiple on Gulfstream's 2018E earnings. In our\nview, GD's competitive business jet product portfolio and growth outlook in defense\ncould provide near-term and medium-term organic growth. Additionally, the company's\nstrong balance sheet and solid cash generation could sustain dividend growth and share\nrepurchases.\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) A downturn in business jets, due to an exogenous\nfactor. 2) Given that business jets are priced in dollars, an unexpected devaluation in the\ndollar could significantly impact order activity, 3) We are forecasting a declining defense\nbudget, which would then place a cap on the top-line growth for the defense primes. We\nview the Administration change as a potential ceiling to defense stocks as political\ncontrol, in our view, is a key driver of defense spending. Decline in defense spending\nauthorization (a leading indicator), which in turn could impact treasury outlays. Potential\nbudget cuts to the Navy's fleet could encumber GD as well as a slowdown in\nprocurement for the Army (armored vehicles). 4) Poor execution on defense programs\ncould adversely impact margins.\nHess Corp. (HES)\nOur price objective of $80 / share is based on a 5-year outlook which assumes a 5.5x\nDACF multiple and a commodity deck of $67.50 WTI and $70 Brent to which we add\n$10 / sh for Liza in offshore Guyana. The multiple is based on a finite timeline to\ndelivery which is supported by core NAV.\nThe risks to our price objective are: 1) the oil and gas price environment, (2) slowdowns\nin development drilling that leave production below expectations, and (3) news flow\naround HES' exploratory and appraisal drilling activities that could impact the stock.\nMGM Resorts International (MGM)\nOur $33 PO is based on 11.5x our 2017 EBITDA estimate (implied 10x 2018E EBITDA).\nThis is in line with its historical trading range and supported by our detailed sum of the\nparts analysis.\nUpside risks are: a stronger than anticipated recovery in Las Vegas, improving consumer\nsentiment and its 56% ownership stake in MGM China. Downside risks are: balance\nsheet and liquidity risks proving worse than expected, continued Strip competition, and\ncontinuing near-term softness in the Macau market.\n16 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nNorfolk Southern (NSC)\nOur $122 price objective is based on a 19.5x multiple on our 2017 EPS estimate of\n$6.25. We move above the top of its one-standard deviation historical trading range of\n12x-16x given the new management team's move to improve margins, cut costs, and\nraise its ROIC, and as EPS inflects off a volume deflated 19% decline in 2015.\nRisks to our price objective and estimates are the company's ability to derive continued\noperational benefits, a return to significant pricing competition among the rails, slower\nthan expected economic growth, a deterioration to improving service metrics, a heavily\nunionized employee base, inability to exercise pricing power due to regulatory changes\nor legal challenges from customers, external factors (such as weather) impacting\noperations, and the STB installing mandatory reciprocal switching (or open access) to\nthe rail network without proper pricing.\nSVB Financial Group (SIVB)\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $190 price\nobjective and assign a 2.3x multiple to our 2017e TBV and apply a 21x P/E to 17E EPS.\nOur valuation multiples are both in line with high growth peers due to SIVB's high\nprofitability and EPS growth profile. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of\n9.5% and a terminal growth rate of 6%.\nDownside risks are a longer than expected low rate environment and a slowdown in the\ntechnology sector and related IPO activity. Upside risks are sooner than expected rate\nhike, or better than expected pickup in the tech sector.\nTexas Instruments Inc. (TXN)\nOur $82 PO on TXN is based on14x FY17E EV/EBITDA, in line with high quality\ndiversified and analog peers trading at 14x-15x, given TXN's high quality business model\nand strong FCF generation.\nRisks to our price objective: 1) Lumpy telco capex, especially in wireless deployments, 2)\nVolatile market share as design cycle times are very long, 3) Increased R&D spending\npressure to maintain an edge versus the competition, 4) Inventory cycles and potential\ndouble ordering by customers that can often create mismatches between real supply\nand demand, 5) Exposure to several mature markets such as PC and other consumer\nelectronics could limit its growth rate.\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\nOur price objective of $41 is based on 21x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate. This\nmultiple represents a premium to online travel/vertical media comps and in our view\nadequately compensates TripAdvisor for improving margins and growth off a trough\npoint in FY16 into FY17 when the negative impacts of its IB transition peak.\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing competition (e.g. Yelp), 2) macroeconomic\nfactors (e.g. recession in Europe) impacting the travel industry, 3) challenges\nto the credibility of online reviews, 4) Instant Book transition puts pressure on revenue\ngrowth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.\nUpside risks to our price objective are: 1) improved mobile monetization 2) major OTA\nsign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved\nglobal macro environment.\nAnalyst Certification\nWe, Derek Harris, Andrew Obin, Brian Chin, Doug Leggate, Ebrahim H.

For purposes of this Investment Rating Distribution, the coverage universe includes only stocks. A\nstock rated Neutral is included as a Hold, and a stock rated Underperform is included as a Sell.\nFUNDAMENTAL EQUITY OPINION KEY: Opinions include a Volatility Risk Rating, an Investment Rating and an Income Rating. VOLATILITY RISK RATINGS, indicators of potential\nprice fluctuation, are: A - Low, B - Medium and C - High. INVESTMENT RATINGS reflect the analyst’s assessment of a stock’s: (i) absolute total return potential and (ii)\nattractiveness for investment relative to other stocks within its Coverage Cluster (defined below). There are three investment ratings: 1 - Buy stocks are expected to have a total\nreturn of at least 10% and are the most attractive stocks in the coverage cluster; 2 - Neutral stocks are expected to remain flat or increase in value and are less attractive than\nBuy rated stocks and 3 - Underperform stocks are the least attractive stocks in a coverage cluster. Analysts assign investment ratings considering, among other things, the 0-12\nmonth total return expectation for a stock and the firm’s guidelines for ratings dispersions (shown in the table below). The current price objective for a stock should be\nreferenced to better understand the total return expectation at any given time. The price objective reflects the analyst’s view of the potential price appreciation (depreciation).\nInvestment rating Total return expectation (within 12-month period of date of initial rating) Ratings dispersion guidelines for coverage cluster*\nBuy ≥ 10% ≤ 70%\nNeutral ≥ 0% ≤ 30%\nUnderperform N/A ≥ 20%\n* Ratings dispersions may vary from time to time where BofA Merrill Lynch Research believes it better reflects the investment prospects of stocks in a Coverage Cluster.\nINCOME RATINGS, indicators of potential cash dividends, are: 7 - same/higher (dividend considered to be secure), 8 - same/lower (dividend not considered to be secure) and 9 - pays\nno cash dividend. Coverage Cluster is comprised of stocks covered by a single analyst or two or more analysts sharing a common industry, sector, region or other classification(s). A stock’s\ncoverage cluster is included in the most recent BofA Merrill Lynch report referencing the stock.\nPrice charts for the securities referenced in this research report are available at http://pricecharts.baml.com, or call 1-800-MERRILL to have them mailed.\nMLPF&S or one of its affiliates acts as a market maker for the equity securities recommended in the report: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts,\nNorfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\n28 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017\nMLPF&S or an affiliate was a manager of a public offering of securities of this issuer within the last 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM\nResorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nThe issuer is or was, within the last 12 months, an investment banking client of MLPF&S and/or one or more of its affiliates: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess,\nMGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate has received compensation from the issuer for non-investment banking services or products within the past 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp,\nGeneral Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\nThe issuer is or was, within the last 12 months, a non-securities business client of MLPF&S and/or one or more of its affiliates: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics,\nHess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, SVB Financial, Texas Instrument, TripAdvisor.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate has received compensation for investment banking services from this issuer within the past 12 months: Aetna Inc, Consolidated Edison, Dover Corp, General Dynamics,\nHess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S or an affiliate expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from this issuer or an affiliate of the issuer within the next three months: Aetna Inc,\nDover Corp, General Dynamics, Hess, MGM Resorts, Norfolk Southern, Texas Instrument.\nMLPF&S together with its affiliates beneficially owns one percent or more of the common stock of this issuer.
