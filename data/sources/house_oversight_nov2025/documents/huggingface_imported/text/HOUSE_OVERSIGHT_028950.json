That vision was to\nproduce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of\nhumanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and\ninformal, online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to\nbegin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028950",
