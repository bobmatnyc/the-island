  "text": "a vast staff, in effect going into the business of giving away money, yet\nanother business you are unlikely to know anything about.”\n\nAt just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the\nincredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to\nacquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public\nholdings, or obvious paper trails. In essence, the formulation is, how can a\nperson have enough money to merit increasing attention, but no clear way of\nhaving gotten it. Epstein gets stuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he\nis without institutional protection or bona fides. He is a questionable\nsubstrata of wealth. He’s a freelancer.\n\nIn the Epstein telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy\npeople and families.\n\nIn a sense, he’s their instrument, doing their bidding, and for a period\ndescribes himself as recovering money, as something like a private\ndetective. If early in his career he might seem like a sort of George Peppard\n(there’s a resemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later\nhe’s George Peppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.\n\nHe steps up his game and his relationship with the rich. He’s not just\ndoing their bidding or their investing, he’s helping them to imagine the\nambitions of their wealth. They’ve satisfied their business dreams. Now\nthere are the separate challenges and possibilities of their actual wealth.\n\nIn essence, the response to this, as he becomes more public, as a\nfunction of envy and media, is “bullshit.” True, there is no clear alternate\nnarrative. No one is accusing him of anything, accept, sometimes, guilt by\nassociation. (In addition to Robert Maxwell, who will be accused of fraud,\nthere’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high flyer, who went to jail\nfor a Ponzi, for whom Epstein acted as a consultant.) But the\ncharacterization persist: if it’s not clear, it must be murky. Sure, Goldman\nSachs partners and tech fortunes, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-\nlike no-namer?\n\nIn 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television\nacknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting\nnext to Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in London (Diana\nis wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon Carter, into his\nsecond years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and\nCarter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both\nare a function of the age of new money, and both are helped by strategic\nrelationships with the exceptionally wealthy. To say that Epstein, sitting next\nto the Princess, sticks in Carter’s craw would be an understatement. Epstein\nbecomes one of the “what do you know about him” figures in Carter’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022963",
