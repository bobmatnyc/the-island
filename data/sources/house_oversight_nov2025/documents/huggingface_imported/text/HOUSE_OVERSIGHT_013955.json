  "text": "Before the development of tourism, travel was conceived to be like study, and its fruits were\nconsidered to be the adornment of the mind and the formation of the judgment.\n\n— PAUL FUSSELL, Abroad\n\nThe simple willingness to improvise is more vital, in the long run, than research.\n—ROLF POTTS, Vagabonding\n\nU,. Sherwood’s return from Oktoberfest, dazed from killing neurons but the happiest he’s been\n\nin four years, the remote trial is made policy and Sherwood is inducted into the world of the New Rich.\nAll he needs now is an idea of how to exploit this freedom and the tools to give his finite cash near-\ninfinite lifestyle output.\n\nIf you’ve gone through the previous steps, eliminating, automating, and severing the leashes that bind\nyou to one location, it’s time to indulge in some fantasies and explore the world.\n\nEven if you have no ache for extended travel or think it’s impossible— whether due to marriage or\nmortgage or those little things known as children—this chapter is still the next step. There are\nfundamental changes I and most others put off until absence (or preparation for it) forces them. This\nchapter is your final exam in muse design.\n\nThe transformation begins in a small Mexican village, in a parable that’s been shared in various forms\naround the world.\n\nFables and Fortune Hunters\n\nA, American businessman took a vacation to a small coastal Mexican village on doctor’s orders.\n\nUnable to sleep after an urgent phone call from the office the first morning, he walked out to the pier to\nclear his head.

What do you do with the rest of your time?”\n\nThe Mexican looked up and smiled. “I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, take a siesta with\nmy wife, Julia, and stroll into the village each evening, where I sip wine and play guitar with my amigos.\nI have a full and busy life, sefior.”\n\nThe American laughed and stood tall. “Sir, ’m a Harvard M.B.A. and can help you. You should spend\nmore time fishing, and with the proceeds, buy a bigger boat. In no time, you could buy several boats with\nthe increased haul. Eventually, you would have a fleet of fishing boats.”\n\nHe continued, “Instead of selling your catch to a middleman, you would sell directly to the consumers,\neventually opening your own cannery.
