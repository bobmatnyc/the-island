An\nact of obeisance, if not humiliation.\n\nThe otherworldly sense of Trump Tower helped obscure the fact that few in the thin\nranks of Trump’s inner circle, with their overnight responsibility for assembling a\ngovernment, had almost any relevant experience. Nobody had a political background.\nNobody had a policy background. Nobody had a legislative background.\n\nPolitics is a network business, a who-you-know business. But unlike other presidents-\nelect—all of whom invariably suffered from their own management defects—Trump did\nnot have a career’s worth of political and government contacts to call on. He hardly even\nhad his own political organization. For most of the last eighteen months on the road, it had\nbeen, at its core, a three-person enterprise: his campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski\n(until he was forced out a month before the Republican National Convention); his\nspokesperson-bodyperson-intern, the campaign’s first hire, twenty-six-year-old Hope\nHicks; and Trump himself. Lean and mean and gut instincts—the more people you had to\ndeal with, Trump found, the harder it was to turn the plane around and get home to bed at\nnight.\n\nThe professional team—although in truth there was hardly a political professional\namong them—that had joined the campaign in August was a last-ditch bid to avoid\nhopeless humiliation. But these were people he’d worked with for just a few months.\n\nReince Priebus, getting ready to shift over from the RNC to the White House, noted,\nwith alarm, how often Trump offered people jobs on the spot, many of whom he had never\nmet before, for positions whose importance Trump did not particularly understand.\n\nAiles, a veteran of the Nixon, Reagan, and Bush 41 White Houses, was growing\nworried by the president-elect’s lack of immediate focus on a White House structure that\ncould serve and protect him. He tried to impress on Trump the ferocity of the opposition\nthat would greet him.\n\n“You need a son of a bitch as your chief of staff. And you need a son of a bitch who\nknows Washington,” Ailes told Trump not long after the election. “You’ll want to be your\nown son of a bitch, but you don’t know Washington.” Ailes had a suggestion: “Speaker\nBoehner.” (John Boehner had been the Speaker of the House until he was forced out in a\nTea Party putsch in 2011.)\n\n“Who’s that?” asked Trump.\n\nEverybody in Trump’s billionaire circle, concerned about his contempt for other\npeople’s expertise, tried to impress upon him the importance of the people, the many\npeople, he would need with him in the White House, people who understood Washington.\nYour people are more important than your policies. Your people are your policies.\n\n“Frank Sinatra was wrong,” said David Bossie, one of Trump’s longtime political\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019903",
