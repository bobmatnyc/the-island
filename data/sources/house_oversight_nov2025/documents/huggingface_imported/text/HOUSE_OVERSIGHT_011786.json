  "text": "/ BARAK / 29\n\nMinister. But fewer and fewer Israelis were enthusiastic about four more years of\nBibi. But I also was keen to convey the substance of what my premiership would\nbe about. Domestically, I spoke of the need to narrow gaps in education and\nopportunity — particularly, though not only, the continuing disadvantage of many in\nthe Sephardi communities who had arrived in the early years of the state. | wanted\nto try to build bridges between the secular and religious as well. My hope was to\nbegin to recreate the “One Israel” of my youth.\n\nIn terms of policy, I believed my primary job would be deliver “security and\npeace” — in that order. I declared my commitment to continue, and build on, Oslo\nand to make a new push in negotiations with Syria. Deliberately following the\nmodel Philip Gould had used in Tony Blair’s election campaign, we also\ndistributed nearly a million copies of a six-point policy “pledge card”. It included a\npromise to hold a referendum on any peace deal we reached with Syria or the\nPalestinians, as well as several domestic policy pledges, including an end to\ndiscrimination against Russian immigrants whose Jewish religious status had been\ncalled into question.\n\nYet the most widely reported promise was that I would pull out all Israeli troops\nfrom Lebanon within a year. I realized that even among those who knew that made\nsense, voices would be raised both in the Knesset and the Aivra against\nwithdrawing. As with the Bar-Lev Line before the 1973 War, the longer the\n“security zone” was in place, the more difficult that politicians had found it to say\nit was a mistake. Yet it had now been there for nearly two decades. The main\nargument for keeping it — that it protected the security of northern Israel — was\nundermined by the fact that thousands of Katyusha rockets had been fired over it.\nAnd in the low-grade war we were fighting against Hizbollah inside the security\nzone, around 20 Israeli soldiers had been dying each and every year. When Id first\nvisited our positions in south Lebanon in the early 1980s, chatted with the troops\nand asked them how they were doing, the invariable response was: we’re OK.\nWe’re just worried about our young kids back home. Now, those children were\nmanning the same outposts, facing the same danger, in a sliver of land on which\nwe had no claim, which we had no desire to hold, and which was, at best, of\nquestionable security value.\n\n315\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011786",
