  "text": "6. Knock off Ford before the election by Squeaky Fromme, Sara\nJane Moore, whoever.\n\n7. Replace Ford again with Rockefeller, declare martial law and\ncancel the election. Alternatively, this could be done by killing\nJimmy Carter before the inauguration.\n\nNow | realize how naive | was. Granted, Carter is more progressive\nthan | am—after all, politics is the art of finding a balance between the\nstatus quo and the force of evolution—but it became crystal clear to me\nthat he had made some kind of deal. The intelligence-gathering system\nknew about G. Harrold Carswell’ s tragic gay problem. Now, /e would\nhave been a fine prospect for blackmail: “We have this photo of you and\na friend in the men’ s room, Justice Carswell, but don’ t worry, we won’ t\nleak it.” | wonder, if | had been successful in appointing him to the\nSupreme Court, how would he have voted on the constitutionality of\nentrapping homosexuals? Anyway, my suspicions were aroused when it did\nnot come out in the media until after the election—immediately before\nCarter’ s inauguration when it was too late to do us any good—that his\nson Jack had been discharged from the Navy because of marijuana.\n\nOur hammer over George McGovern’ s head in 1972 was that his\ndaughter had been hospitalized for an LSD freakout. We never had to\nresort to using that particular bit of intelligence, however, despite the fact\n\nthat it was wewho had arranged for her to be “dosed” in the first place.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015117",
