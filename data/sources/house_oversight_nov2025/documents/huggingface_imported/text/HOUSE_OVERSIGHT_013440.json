Epstein alleged Edwards abused the court system by threatening to\ndepose Epstein’s powerful friends, which included Donald Trump and President Bill Clinton.\n\nOther claims included that Edwards tried to obtain records from an alleged sex therapist who had never treated Epstein\nand that Edwards used investigative tools that included trespassing on Epstein’s property.\n\nCrow gave Epstein’s attorneys 30 days to refile the lawsuit, which will be the second amended complaint and third\nevolution of the lawsuit.\n\nEpstein also named Edwards’ former boss, convicted Ponzi schemer Scott Rothstein, in the lawsuit, alleging Rothstein\nmade “various representations to potential investors regarding the Epstein actions.”\n\nIn dismissing the lawsuit, Crow said he found “serious problems’ with the complaint. Crow called the lawsuit “vague.\n“You have to know, at this point in time, what he did or didn’t do that was an abuse of process,” Crow said.\n\nEpstein, 58, has confidentially settled more than two dozen lawsuits with young women who allege they were sexually\nabused by him when they were minors.\n\nEdwards filed a counterclaim, alleging Epstein filed the lawsuit to get Edwards to back down from representing the\nvictims.\n\n“Mr. Epstein had to pay more to settle these cases than he would have if Mr. Edwards wasn’t out there putting all this\npressure on him,” said attorney Jack Scarola, who represents Edwards. “That’s Mr. Edwards’ job ... to put as much\nlegitimate pressure on the defendant as he possibly could and he obviously did an extremely effective job.”\n\nEpstein pleaded guilty to two felony charges: soliciting prostitution and soliciting a minor for prostitution. He served 13\nmonths in the county jail and has to register as a lifelong sex offender.\n\nRepresenting Epstein, attorney Joseph Ackerman argued unsuccessfully for a gag order. Ackerman said Scarola has\nrepeatedly made statements to several news organizations about the case.\n\n“Mr. Scarola has constantly referred to Mr. Epstein as a pedophile and there’s been no proof of that anywhere,”\nAckerman said. “Muzzling lawyers who may wish to make public statements has been long recognized as within the\ncourt’s inherent power ... We don’t believe it’s appropriate to wage a media campaign and taint the jury pool.”\nScarola said it would be unconstitutional to impose a gag order.\n\n“There is a complete and total absence of proof that we have engaged in any conduct whatsoever that could be\nprohibited,” Scarola said.\n\nScarola said he and Edwards have been asked to appear on national television as well as received interview requests\nfrom the foreign press. Scarola said he has been selective in his interviews.\n\nThere has been a frenzy in the British press ever since Virginia Roberts, an Epstein victim, spoke to the Sunday Daily\n\nMail earlier this year about being introduced to Prince Andrew and spending time with him at Epstein’s behest. Roberts\nalleged she served as a Sex slave to Epstein when she was a minor.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013440",
