  "text": "understanding depended entirely on past\nexperiences of our own intentions and\nactions, there might be much more\nmisunderstanding and cynicism in the\nworld. However, the capacity to reason,\nhypothesize, and model possible futures\nmay increase social understanding\nbeyond the anchor of purely egocentric\nperspective. We can conceive of\nalternatives to our own goals and\nmotives and relate those alternatives to\nthe actions we observe. To some extent,\nthis process might also involve the motor\nsystem by mentally simulating actions\nand anticipated responses. By imagining\nhow we might act in some situation to\nachieve a goal or the alternative ways we\nmay act given some intention, it may be\npossible to go beyond the limits of our\nown experience. Such constructive\nimagery may well depend on the motor\nsystem, along with other neural systems,\nbut currently there is no scientific\nevidence that such a system might be\nlinked with the operation of mirror\nneurons.\n\nConclusion\n\nWe are equipped to understand\nthe world around us by relating what we\nperceive to our own experiences. With\nrespect to actions in particular, our\nbrains have specialized circuitry to relate\npreviously executed actions to newly\nperceived ones, possibly by performing\nan internal (imagined) simulation of\nthem. There is evidence too that we\nmight understand the emotional states of\nothers by a similar kind of process,\nwhereby our brains activate circuits for\nexperiencing the emotion as a way to\nunderstand that emotion in others. These\nbrain mechanisms might also apply (to a\ngreater or lesser degree) when we try to\nunderstand actions or feelings by non-\nhuman animals or even inanimate\nentities. This could be a partial\n\nPage |82\n\nbiological explanation of\nanthropomorphism, as discussed by\nEpley and Gilpin. Of course as humans\nwe have the ability to go beyond these\nstrict egocentric limitations and\nrecognize and respond to our social\nconnections more explicitly. This ability\nto go beyond the more basic grounding\nof the way we understand others may\nsubserve part of the goal of some\nreligions, discussed by Kathryn Tanner,\nin fostering a more abstract view of our\nconnection to others. While a mirror\nneuron system might help form the basis\nfor some aspects of social understanding,\nthere may well be other invisible forces\nat work supported by these and other\nneural systems in our social brain.\n\nReferences\n\n1.
