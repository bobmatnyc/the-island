  "text": "in the White House for two years and then leave to run Trump’s reelection campaign. “If\nyou can get this idiot elected twice,” Nunberg marveled, you would achieve something\nlike immortality in politics.\n\nBut through another window, Bannon couldn’t possibly remain in place. He seemed to\nhave moved into a heightened state that allowed him to see just how ridiculous the White\nHouse had become. He could barely hold his tongue—indeed, he couldn’t hold it. Pressed,\nhe could not see the future of the Trump administration. And, while many Bannonites\nargued the case for Jarvanka ineffectiveness and irrelevance—just ignore them, they said\n—Bannon, with mounting ferocity and pubic venom, could abide them less and less every\nday.\n\nBannon, continuing to wait for his call to join the president in Bedminster, decided that\nhe would force the situation and offered his resignation to Kelly. But this was in fact a\ngame of chicken: he wanted to stay. On the other hand, he wanted Jarvanka to go. And\nthat became an effective ultimatum.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nAt lunch on August 8, in the Clubhouse at Bedminster—amid Trumpish chandeliers, golf\ntrophies, and tournament plaques—the president was flanked by Tom Price, the secretary\nof health and human services, and his wife, Melania. Kellyanne Conway was at the lunch;\nso were Kushner and several others. This was one of the “make-work” events—over\nlunch, there was a discussion of the opioid crisis, which was then followed by a statement\nfrom the president and a brief round of questions from reporters. While reading the\nstatement in a monotone, Trump kept his head down, propping it on his elbows.\n\nAfter taking some humdrum questions about opioids, he was suddenly asked about\nNorth Korea, and, quite as though in stop-action animation, he seemed to come alive.\n\nNorth Korea had been a heavy-on-detail, short-on-answers problem that that he\nbelieved was the product of lesser minds and weaker resolve—and that he had trouble\npaying attention to. What’s more, he had increasingly personalized his antagonism with\nNorth Korean leader Kim Jong-un, referring to him often with derogatory epithets.\n\nHis staff had not prepared him for this, but, in apparent relief that he could digress\nfrom the opioid discussion, as well as sudden satisfaction at the opportunity to address this\nnagging problem, he ventured out, in language that he’d repeated often in private—as he\nrepeated everything often—to the precipice of an international crisis.\n\n“North Korea best not make any more threats to the United States. They will be met\nwith the fire and the fury like the world has never seen. He has been very threatening\nbeyond a normal state, and as I said they will be met with fire and fury and frankly power,\nthe likes of which this world has never seen before. Thank you.”\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020104",
