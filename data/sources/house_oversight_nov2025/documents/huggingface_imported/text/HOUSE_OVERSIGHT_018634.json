  "text": "Thus, before having such an intense psychological encounter, I should feel that the\nencounter will ultimately -- through the pain and anxiety and tears -- make me feel more\nsupported, more capable, more powerful in the world. One angle on this is to trust my\npartner a great deal, and be sure that he wants the best for me -- to be sure that in the end,\nhe wants me to be as strong as I started... or stronger.\n\nIt's possible that I might not need so much support from my partner, if I get support\nelsewhere in my life: perhaps from friends, perhaps from a Kink Aware therapist, perhaps\nfrom a great job or a solid diet and exercise plan, perhaps even from another partner. (Of\ncourse, if I were planning to get extensive emotional processing support from other\npeople, then I would seek their consent beforehand.)\n\nStill, it seems like the easiest way to get support would be to get it from my partner, who\nwould share more of the experience with me than anyone else. This would also build our\nintimacy, which is usually a major factor in having intense S&M encounters in the first\nplace.\n\nKK ok\n\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nS&M:\n[storytime] Predicament Bondage\n\nI wrote this in early 2011. Amusingly, after I wrote it, one of the top Google queries that\nbrings people to my blog became the phrase \"predicament bondage.\" I think those folks\nare probably looking for porn, and I wonder if my article disappoints them.\n\nte Kk ok\n\nPredicament Bondage\n\nSome people are masochists (who enjoy pain) but not submissives (who enjoy, well,\nsubmitting). Some people are really into discipline (with lots of punishment) but not\nbondage (rope, cages, etc). Some people are sadists (who enjoy inflicting sensations) but\nnot dominants (who enjoy being in control). Some people are switches, who find that\nthey can switch between roles -- they can be dominant or submissive; sadistic or\nmasochistic... Iam an example of a definite switch.\n\nMe, I get positively bored if someone takes a long time tying me up. For other people, 45\nminutes of elaborate knotwork = really hot foreplay. I don't understand this, but that's\ncool; plenty of people don't understand my preferences and we all coexist quite happily\n\nanyway.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018634",
