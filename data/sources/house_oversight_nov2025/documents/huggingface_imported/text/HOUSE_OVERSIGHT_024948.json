  "text": "occurred in the capital markets in the world.\n\nWith regard to your point that the attraction of foreign investment has been among the priorities of economic\nmobility in the UAE; it is an inaccurate assumption. Investment plans have no limits or boundaries. There are\nforeign investments in the UAE, and the=2 OUAE in its turn has countless investments in many regions of the\nworld. Investments imply promising opportunities ina favorable environment. This is what attracted foreign\ninvestment to the UAE, and the investment environment remains favorable in the UAE; the opportunities are\nstill promising, and the UAE 1s still the most important regional center for business and international trade.\nToday, it is more promising than ever before, and the advent of smart investors to the UAE has not stopped.\nBy Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper\n\n\"Security and profit\" are two very important concepts for the investor, and it is known\nthat the UAE has been a breeding ground for the development of capital in recent years.\nThis was reflected on the arrival of the most prominent businessmen, major companies\nand famous brands to the country. The active UAE financial market contributed to the\nsuccess of many companies, which turned into public joint stock companies, with billions\nof dirhams having been pumped into their capital. This means that thousands of\ninvestors were involved in the ownership of shares. Recently, however, we have witnessed\nlegal and financial issues involving prominent names of UAE nationals. What does Your\nHighness have to say with regard to the investment community in the UAE on the\ncapacity of governmental oversight of corporate governance and management of the\nshareholders and their rights?\n\nThese legal issues are evidence of firm government20concern about good corporate governance and its\ncommitment to sound accounting principles, rules of governance and transparency. The government is\nconstantly working to develop bodies, procedures and safeguards. No one 1s above the law in the UAE, and\nwhoever crosses the line will be sought by judicial authorities and legally tried.\n\nBy Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper\n\nIn light of the talk about the scarcity of liquidity in the domestic market, Dubai US$20\nbillion in bonds. Central Bank is subscribing to $10 billion of those bonds. Officials of the\nEmirate stated that there is no current need for the rest of the money. Does this mean that\nthe Government of Dubai has closed the doors for new subscription to a second tranche?\nWill support be provided by the Government of Dubai for the companies as a grant?\n\nThe doors to subscription have not been shut down. The subscriptions so far meet our requirements. The\nsupport given to companies is not a grant, because its origin is the bill, and companies possess productive assets\nthat enable them to meet all the requirements. The problem of these companies is part of the liquidity problem\nthat has afflicted the financial system and banking world.\n\nBy Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper\n\nLooking at the entities that will avail from Dubai government’s financial support, can we\nsay that Dubai government affiliate companies have overestimated their financial\ncapabilities to cover development requirements, then subsequently their administrations\nbecame responsible for the level of these companies’ transparency in handling their\nprojects?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024948",
