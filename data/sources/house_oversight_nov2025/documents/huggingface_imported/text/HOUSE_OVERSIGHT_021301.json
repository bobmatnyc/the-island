  "text": "reciprocal control, characteristic of\nreflex processes, where autonomic\nbalance can be biased toward one or the\nother of the autonomic branches. High\nscores indicate sympathetic dominance\nand low scores parasympathetic\ndominance. Independent estimates of\nsympathetic and parasympathetic control\nwere obtained using standard\nmeasurement procedures, and the level\nof parasympathetic control was\nsubtracted from sympathetic control to\nderive a measure of Cardiac Autonomic\nBalance. A second metric was designed\nto capture an alternative mode of\nautonomic control (Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation) that assesses the degree of\nrelative coactivation (rather than\nreciprocal activation) of both branches.\nThis is a metric that taps into the non-\nreciprocal regulatory influences of\nhigher neural structures. Cardiac\nAutonomic Regulation scores were\nderived by essentially summing\nactivities of the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic branches to afford a\nmeasure of total overall autonomic\ncardiac control. High scores indicate\nhigh activation and low scores indicate\nlow activation of both branches of the\nautonomic nervous system.\n\nIn the 50-68-year-old adults in\nour sample, spirituality was found to be\nassociated not only with a lower\nincidence of heart attack, but a higher\nlevel of Cardiac Autonomic Regulation.\nThat is, people who felt closer in their\nrelationship with God exhibited higher\noverall autonomic regulation—both\nsympathetic and parasympathetic. This\nwas associated, in part, with lesser\ndiminution of parasympathetic control\nand a greater degree of coactivation.\nMoreover, Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation (but not Cardiac Autonomic\nBalance) predicted better overall health\n\nPage |55\n\nstatus and was associated with a lower\nincidence of heart attack. Participants\nwho had low Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation were more likely to have\nsuffered from a heart attack.\n\nCould higher Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation scores explain why\nspirituality was associated with less risk\nfor heart attack? That is, could a pattern\nof autonomic regulation associated with\nspirituality explain the link between\nspirituality and heart attack? In order to\naddress this question, we conducted\nstatistical tests of these linkages. As we\nalready knew, both spirituality and\nCardiac Autonomic Regulation are\nassociated with a lower incidence of\nheart attack. When the predictive effects\nof spirituality were statistically\nextracted, Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation continued to be a significant\npredictor of a lower incidence of heart\nattack. However, when the linkage test\nwas reversed and the effects of Cardiac\nAutonomic Regulation were extracted,\nSpirituality was no longer a significant\npredictor. This indicates that Cardiac\nAutonomic Regulation is a plausible\nmediator that may explain the\nrelationship between spirituality and\nheart attack.\n\nBy capturing higher levels of\nparasympathetic control and the\nassociated autonomic coactivation of the\nsympathetic and parasympathetic\nbranches, Cardiac Autonomic\nRegulation provided a critical metric that\npermitted the study of a previously\n“invisible” and mysterious link between\nspirituality and health outcomes. This in\nno way diminishes the relationship\nbetween spirituality and health, but\nrather offers an important hypothesis as\nto how spirituality may impact\nphysiology and health status.
