Brad has taken it from aD minus toaC minus, IfI were youl\nwould set the goal of an A. just like your paintings. . Like a house you could attempt to renovate it. it\nwill take more time and money. or. in essence as I suggested in dec of 13, start from scratch. A\nfinancail head of office. - brad could move to being richards replacment as trustee. . barry cohen would\nbe perfect but carries the trustee taint now. . take a tax partner from a major firm. to replace joslin,\ncost 1+ mil . keep heather and ssmantha. . bring in full time IT person. ASAP . your lighting\ncontractor in your new townhouse has better IT than your multi billlion dollar antique opersation. data\nbreaches are not your concern. precision is. . either re do the office layout . or get enterly new space.\nthe proposals to focus on following on a monthly basis the values of all your current investments is an\nexample of misplaced prioirties. . Your office is the heart of the familys financial life and temp future,\nit needs a heart operation\n\nDate: Mon, Oct 19, 2015 at 5:10 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023283",
