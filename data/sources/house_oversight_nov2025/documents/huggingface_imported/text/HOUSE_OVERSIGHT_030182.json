Yet such a plan may not withstand legal\nscrutiny. If non-Hamas PA officials failed to honor the agreement and\nHamas gained access to U.S. funds, prosecutors might one day argue\nthat the persons who made the donation knew that such a result was\nlikely and disregarded the risk. Such “willful blindness” could serve\nas the basis of a criminal prosecution. Or, the whole government may\nturn out to be Hamas-affiliated, rendering any such distinction\nmeaningless.\n\nThe Obama administration could also instruct OFAC to grant specific\nexemptions so that the United States could fund particular entities\nwithin the PA. OFAC followed this strategy in 2006, announcing at\nthe time that “consistent with current foreign policy” it was\n“authorizing U.S. persons to engage in certain transactions in which\nthe PA may have an interest.” Mirroring some of the exceptions listed\nunder PATA, OFAC exempted transactions with the Palestinian\njudiciary, non-Hamas members of the Palestinian Legislative\nCouncil, and various entities controlled by Abbas.\n\nAlthough the United States sought to continue supporting non-Hamas\nelements of the PA in 2006, it is doubtful that OFAC could repeat the\nsame tactic now, thanks to the relationship between Fatah and\nHamas. In 2006, Hamas campaigned against Fatah and tensions\nbetween the two camps remained strong after the election. Armed\nconflict broke out the following year despite the creation of a de facto\nunity government, splintering the PA. Should the current\nreconciliation agreement come to fruition, however, it would create a\njoint power-sharing government. As a result, it may be more difficult\nfor OFAC to justify special exemptions on the grounds that certain\nentities within the PA are insulated from Hamas; by all appearances,\nthey will be intertwined.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030182",
