  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n829\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nrecruiting donations to the Holy Land\nFoundation, a known supporter of Hamas,\ndistributing pro-Hamas literature, and fea-\nturing pro-Hamas speakers at their meet-\nings); see also Burnett [, 274 F.Supp.2d at\n107 (noting the complaint in Bow was\nquite specific in its allegation of a causal\nlink). Under a conspiracy theory, the\nPlaintiffs have to allege that the Defen-\ndants were involved in an agreement to\naccomplish an unlawful act and that the\nattacks of September 11 were a reasonably\nforeseeable consequence of that conspira-\ncy. See Bowm IIT, 340 F.Supp.2d at 895\n(framing analysis as what plaintiffs have to\nprove to succeed on summary judgment).\nPlaintiffs do not have to allege that Defen-\ndants knew specifically about the Septem-\nber 11 attacks or that they committed any\nspecific act in furtherance of that attack.\nId.\n\n5. Wrongful Death and Survival\n\n[81] New York Estates, Powers and\nTrusts Law governs Plaintiffs’ claims of\nwrongful death and survival. “The per-\nsonal representative ... of a decedent who\nis survived by distributees may maintain\nan action to recover damages for a wrong-\nful act, neglect or default which caused the\ndecedent’s death against a person who\nwould have been liable to the decedent by\nreason of such wrongful conduct if death\nhad not ensued.” N.Y. Est. Powers &\nTrusts § 54.1 (McKinney 2002); see also\nN.Y. Est. Powers & Trusts § 11-3.2(b)\n(McKinney 2002) (outlining survival claim:\n“No cause of action for injury to person or\nproperty is lost because of the death of the\nperson in whose favor the cause of action\nexisted. For any injury an action may be\nbrought or continued by the personal rep-\nresentative of the decedent.”). According-\nly, the Court finds that if Plaintiffs are\npersonal representatives and their allega-\ntions sufficiently allege that Defendants\nsupported, aided and abetted, or conspired\n\nwith the September 11 terrorists, they will\nhave also stated claims for wrongful death\nand survival.\n\n6. Assault and Battery and Inten-\ntional Infliction of Emotional Dis-\ntress\n\n[82] The Federal Plaintiffs bring\nclaims of assault and battery and inten-\ntional infliction of emotional distress. The\nBurnett and Ashton Plaintiffs also allege\nclaims of intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress. The statute of limitations for\nassault and battery and intentional inflic-\ntion of emotional distress is one year.\nHolmes v. Lorch, 329 F.Supp.2d 516, 523\n(S.D.N.Y.2004); N.Y. C.P.L.R. 2150)\n(McKinney 2002). The Federal Plaintiffs\nfiled their complaint on September 10,\n2008, nearly two years after September 11,\n2001. Accordingly, their assault and bat-\ntery and intentional infliction of emotional\ndistress claims are dismissed against the\nSAAR Network and Arab Bank.\n\n[83, 84] “Under New York law, a claim\nfor intentional infliction of emotional dis-\ntress requires a showing of () extreme\nand outrageous conduct; (2) intent to\ncause, or reckless disregard of a substan-\ntial probability of causing, severe emotion-\nal distress; (8) a causal connection be-\ntween the conduct and the injury; and (4)\nsevere emotional distress.” Stuto v. Fle-\nishman, 164 F.3d 820, 827 2d Cir.1999)\n(citing Howell v. New York Post Co. 81\nN.Y.2d 115, 121, 596 N.Y.S.2d 350, 612\nN.E.2d 699 (1998)). “ ‘Liability has been\nfound only where the conduct has been so\noutrageous in character, and so extreme in\ndegree, as to go beyond all possible bounds\nof decency, and to be regarded as atro-\ncious, and utterly intolerable in a civilized\nsociety.” Jd. (quoting Howell, 81 N.Y.2d\nat 122, 596 N.Y.S.2d 350, 612 N.E.2d 699).\nCourts are to determine whether the al-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017894",
