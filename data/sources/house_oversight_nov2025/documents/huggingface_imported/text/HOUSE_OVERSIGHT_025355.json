  "text": "Honorable Mark Filip\nMay 19, 2008\nPage 3\n\nprivate practice in South Florida with personal relationships to some of the prosecutors involved.\nFederal prosecutors then leaked highly sensitive information about the case to a New York\nTimes reporter! The immediate result of this confluence of extraordinary circumstances is an\nonslaught of civil lawsuits, all save one brought by the First Assistant’s former boutique law firm\nin Miami.\n\nThe facts in this case all revolve around the classic state crime of solicitation of\nprostitution? The State Attorney’s Office in Palm Beach County had conducted a diligent\ninvestigation, convened a Grand Jury that returned an indictment, and made a final determination\nabout how to proceed. That is where, in our federal republic, this matter should rest.\nMr. Epstein faces a felony conviction in state court by virtue of his conduct, and the only reason\nthe State has not resolved this matter is that the federal prosecutors in Miami have continued to\ninsist that we, Mr. Epstein’s counsel, approach and demand from the State Attorney’s Office a\nharsher charge and a more severe punishment than that Office believes are appropriate under the\ncircumstances. Yet despite the USAO’s refusal to allow the State to resolve this matter on the\nterms the State has determined are appropriate, the USAO has not made any attempt to\ncoordinate its efforts with the State. In fact, the USAO mandated that any federal agreement\nwould be conditioned on Mr. Epstein persuading the State to seek a criminal punishment unlike\nthat imposed on other defendants within the jurisdiction of the State Attorney for similar\nconduct.\n\nFrom the inception of the USAO’s involvement in this case, which at the end of the day\nis a case about solicitation of prostitution within the confines of Palm Beach County, Florida, we\nhave asked ourselves why the Department of Justice is involved. Regrettably, we are unable to\nsuggest any appropriate basis for the Department’s involvement. Mr. Epstein has no criminal\nhistory whatsoever. Also, Mr. Epstein has never been the subject of general media interest until |\na few years ago, after it was widely perceived by the public that he was a close friend of former\nPresident Bill Clinton.\n\nThe conduct at issue is simply not within the purview of federal jurisdiction and lies\noutside the heartland of the three federal statutes that have been identified by prosecutors-~18\nU.S.C. §§ 1591, 2422(b), and 2423(b).\n\n1 One of the other members of Mr. Epstein's defense team, Jay Lefkowitz, has personally reviewed the reporter’s\ncontemporaneous notes.\n\n2 Although some of the women alleged to be involved were 16 and 17 years of age, several of these women\nopenly admitted to lying to Mr. Epstein about their age in their recent sworn statements.\n\nA00 1440\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025355",
