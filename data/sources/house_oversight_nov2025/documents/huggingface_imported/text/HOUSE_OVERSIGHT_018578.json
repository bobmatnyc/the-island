  "text": "needs. Surely that understanding of sexual roles vs. other needs could be adapted to the\nservice of gender identity. Yet so many BDSMers still fall prey to the same old gendered\npreconceptions, and talk nonsense about how \"all women are naturally submissive\" or\nwhatever.\n\nDon't get me wrong: of course anyone would deserve plenty of blame if they refused to\nlet go of their entitlement, or chose not to examine the ways their behavior might\nsupport an oppressive system. But I think men exist who are willing to do those things,\nyet feel blocked from relevant discussions because participating creates anxiety about\ntheir sexual or gender identity. It strikes me as unreasonable to attack them for that.\nChoosing to present one's sexuality and/or gender identity in a normative way is not in\nitself a sin. It's not fair to expect people to fit themselves into a box that doesn't suit them\n-- not even for The All-Important Cause of better understanding sex and gender.\n\nWhere can we find ideas for how men can be both supportive and non-oppressive, and\novertly masculine? How can we make it to normative men's advantage to analyze\nmasculine norms? What does it look like to be masculine, but liberated from the\nstrictures of stereotypical masculinity? How can we contribute to a Men's Movement that\nencompasses all three bases -- being perceived as masculine, acknowledging male\nprivilege, and deconstructing the problems of masculinity?\n\nte Kk ok\n\nQuestions I Want To Ask Entitled Cis Het Men, Part 3: Space for Men\n\nI'm about to assert something that makes me nervous, because I worry that people are\ngoing to stick me in the \"asshole MRA\" box. Don't get me wrong: I certainly don't think\nthat women have it better, overall, than men do. But I do wonder whether it might be\ngood for feminists to acknowledge that -- although we don't experience nearly as\nmuch privilege as men -- there are a lot of advantages women experience that men don't.\n\nBecause women aren't seen as threatening, we have an easier time doing confrontational\nthings like approaching strangers on the street. Because women aren't seen as fighters, we\nstand a lower chance of being mugged than men do. Because women are seen as\nemotional, we're given a huge amount of social space to consider and discuss our\nfeelings. I can work with and be affectionate with children far more easily than a man\ncould. I can be explicit and overt about my sexuality without being viewed as a creep.\n\nAnd there are at least a few recurring complaints about how trying to be masculine can\nsuck. First and foremost: that men don't feel they've been taught to process their\nemotions, or don't feel allowed to display them. Another: that they're perceived as less\nmanly if they don't achieve success through a career, especially if they aren't the main\nbreadwinner for their family. A third: that men are expected to be sexually insatiable, or\nalways to be sexually available.\n\nOf course, it's worth noting that the advantages women experience are almost always the\nflip side of unfortunate stereotypes. For instance, one might say that women get more\nsocial space for emotion because we're stereotyped as irrational and hysterical. But that\ndoesn't change the fact that most of us easily grasp that space, while most men don't. And\nif we can reject the Oppression Olympics for just one minute and stop thinking about\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018578",
