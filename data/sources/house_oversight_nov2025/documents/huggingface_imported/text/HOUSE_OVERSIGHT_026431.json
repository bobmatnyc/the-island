Edmond de Rothschild has an outstanding track record,\nhistory and presence in European infrastructure, as well as being one of Europe’s most recognized financial\nadvisors to the infrastructure market. We have developed deep expertise in the infrastructure sector and\nsought secure, well-managed assets, generating stable, long-term returns for investors.\n\nWe have done so by initiating and backing two experienced and highly-respected managers in the industry,\nTIIC and BRIDGE. TIIC is an equity investor in transport and social infrastructure. BRIDGE is an infrastructure\ndebt provider. Both managers are covered in more detail below. Edmond de Rothschild has been heavily\ninvolved in the launch of the below funds, providing crucial support in fund structuring, due diligence,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026431",
