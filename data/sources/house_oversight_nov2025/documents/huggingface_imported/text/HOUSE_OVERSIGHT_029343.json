  "text": "The freshman congressman from Brooklyn and a sliver of Queens is an ambitious work horse who always\nappears to have his eye on the prize.\n\n\"I'll be shuffling back and forth between budget and judiciary for the better part of the morning, making sure we\ntime it correctly so that I'm able to ask questions in both situations,\" he said.\n\nHe's a big change from Congressman Ed Towns, who retired after holding the seat for 30 years.\n\nOn any given day, Jeffries is traveling through the Capitol, attending hearings on the Judiciary and Budget\ncommittees, two of the most prominent in the lower chamber.\n\nFor Jeffries, those two assignments allow him to serve as a counterweight to the Republican leadership and to\ntalk up the President, whom he and his district overwhelmingly support.\n\n\"My job, I believe, is to help the administration of Barack Obama help us back at home,\" Jeffries said.\n\nIn his first four months, Jeffries has championed himself as a progressive, introducing legislation to help student\nloan recipients and voting against a bill Friday to ease the impact of automatic spending cuts to the FAA\nbecause it didn't stop cuts to programs that are impacting the poor.\n\nIn the months and years ahead, Jeffries says there's plenty to do.\n\n\"There's no shortage of the people's business down in Washington, D.C. and that's why the job is one that is a\nserious endeavor,\" he said.\n\nA serious endeavor that is also very much on message.\n\nYou are subscribed to this mailing list as I Please click here to modify your message\npreferences or to unsubscribe from any future mailings.
