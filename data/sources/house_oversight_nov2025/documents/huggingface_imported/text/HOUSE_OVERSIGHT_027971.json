  "text": "they have to accomplish this all on their own. A// of us must assume that. Keep\ncool. Stay focused. Rely on your instincts. We’re ready for this mission. And\nwe are going to achieve it.”\n\nOne minute after four in the afternoon, we got the word to go. I was in the\nlead buggy, consciously trying to look like a civilian, not a soldier. It was about\na mile-and-a-half to the aircraft. I glanced back at the others. Like me, many of\nthem had been awake for 30 hours or more, in some cases nearly 48 hours. The\nair marshals had been plucked off long-haul flights on which relaxation, much\nless sleep, was not an option. As before any mission, I knew everyone would be\nthinking about what was about to happen. They also realized that if we failed,\nthe passengers trapped inside the plane would be at the mercy of terrorists\narmed with AK-47s and explosives. But I was confident that any apprehension\nwould be overtaken by adrenalin when as the assault began.\n\nAs we got closer, Shai Agmon radioed me. He said two or three people, not\nthe terrorists, had come out of the plane. One seemed to be the Red Cross man.\nThey were about 120 yards away from the aircraft. As soon as he’d signed off, I\ngot word from the command post in the control tower that it was indeed the Red\nCross representative, along with two of the flight crew. They’d been chosen by\nthe terrorists to do security checks on the “maintenance” men.\n\nI brought the convoy to a halt. The Red Cross man gave each of us a fairly\ncursory body search before waving us on. Then, he got to Bibi. Though I had\nsomehow failed to notice, he had left on his red sayeret boots. In Israel, that was\nthe equivalent of a neon sign saying: “I am a paratrooper.” Although the Red\nCross man noticed the boots, he at first made no comment. Then, rolling up the\npants leg of Bibi’s overalls, he saw his Beretta — not inside his waistbelt, but\ninside the boot. The next thing I heard was an angry spurt of French as the man\ncalled the control tower. For a moment, I feared the mission was over, with\npotentially fatal repercussions for the hostages. But whatever explanation the\nRed Cross man was given — presumably by Dayan himself, who would not have\nheld back in conveying what was at stake — it dissuaded him from taking further\naction.\n\nAs we were returning to the buggies, the Red Cross man told me that\n“Captain Rifa’at” had ordered us to pull up to the generator on the side of the\nplane. Each of us would then have to walk forward and open the front of our\noveralls so he could make sure we weren’t armed. I passed back four orders to\nthe rest of the men. First, with no exceptions, move your pistol to the back of\nyour belt. Second: I’Il be the first to go through the inspection. Third: watch\n\n123\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027971",
