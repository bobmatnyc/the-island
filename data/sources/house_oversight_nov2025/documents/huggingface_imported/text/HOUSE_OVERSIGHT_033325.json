  "text": "other in fickle and short-lived alliances, ultimately their goals will collide and the\nrelationship deteriorates into mutually self-defeating conflicts. This, too, acts as\nnegative selection and maintains the low frequency of this peculiar phenotype.\n\nOn the other side of the conflict is the selective pressure on the rest of society.\nBecause sociopaths are rare, the intensity of the pressure on society to detect and\nneutralize them is correspondingly weak. Weak pressure leads to poor adaptation,\nwhile sociopaths experience strong pressure and become highly adapted. However,\nas the sociopath phenotype finds evolutionary success, the pressure flips back the\nother direction as the rest of society experiences increasing pressure, adapts, and\nthen pushes the frequency of the sociopaths back down to the basal level. In human\nculture, this pendulum swings in both the long time scales of genetic evolution and\nthe short time scales of cultural evolution. In both contexts, the conflict is cyclical.\n\nWith this evolutionary framework in mind, we can now return to the question of\nPresident Trump. Clearly, he attracts devoted supporters. When it serves him, he\ncan be affable, charming, and flattering. He reads people well and can maneuver\nthrough his relationships in order to obtain the best “deal” for himself. While many\nquestion his capacity for emotional empathy, his skills in cognitive empathy are\nundeniable.\n\nHowever, he also has maintained an unwavering pursuit of wealth, influence, and\npower, even by his own admission. He has never participated in regular religious\nobservance, is not outwardly pious, and shows no allegiance to political party. It is\nwell documented that his views have shifted, sometimes repeatedly, on the most\ncentral political questions of the day such as abortion, government involvement in\nhealthcare, military interventionism, federal drug policy, and LGBTQ rights. While\nonly his critics view him as racist and xenophobic, even his supporters see him as\nfiercely nationalistic and his own campaign slogan of “America First” underscores\nthis. And finally, he aggressively pursues his own biological fitness through the\nplacement of his children in top positions in both his business enterprises and his\npresidential administration. Thus, an evolutionary analysis reveals that he is clearly\nnot a psychopath.\n\nWhether or not he is a narcissistic sociopath, then, depends on the answers to\nquestions about his conscience or lack thereof, commitment to truth and\ntransparency, sincerity in his religious beliefs, fidelity to political ideals, and\ntendency to cheat, deceive, and coerce. These questions are more like Rorschach\ntests in which his supporters and detractors come to the exact opposite conclusions.\nHowever, for the most part, the answers to these questions do not require a\npsychological analysis of the President. There is abundant evidence in the public\nrecord.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033325",
