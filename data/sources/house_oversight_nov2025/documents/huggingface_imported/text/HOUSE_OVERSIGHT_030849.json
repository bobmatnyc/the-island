Morgan View\n28 March 2013\n\nJan Loeys\n(1-212) 834-5874\njan.loeys@jpmorgan.com\n\nLocal issues must be monitored and understood, though, to decide how to\nallocate capital and risk. Just to review a few, Japanese policy makers\ncontinue to present a concerted plan to reflate their economy through\nmonetary, fiscal and structural measures. The strong control of the\ngovernment and its high approval rating are steadily raising the chance of\nsuccess. We stay overweight Japanese equities and grow wary of the short yen\ntrade, as capital inflows and rising growth expectations (chart of right) are\nultimately bullish for the currency. Watch next week’s BoJ meeting, led by\nnewly appointed Governor Kuroda, for new reflationary measures.\n\nThe Euro area economy remains in recession, while policy makers are\nmaking little effort to reverse the contraction. We monitor signs of any large\ndeposit flight post Cyprus over coming weeks and months to judge whether\nthe bailout may actually be worsening conditions in the Euro. Economic\nforecast momentum remains negative (chart of right). These are good reasons\nto underweight the Euro area, if not all of Europe, across asset classes, against\nthe rest of the world.\n\nThe US, in contrast, is seeing better spending from both corporates and\nconsumers than we could have expected post Fiscal Cliff and sequestration.\nBut given the huge amount of fiscal drag, which is a fact, we want to see\nanother 1-2 months of data before extrapolating the good news. It did support\nUS equities in recent weeks, which continue to benefit from US corporates\nissuing debt to buy their own shares and others', through M&A. This corporate\nrotation from debt to equities is almost exclusively a US flow, which helps\nexplain US equity outperformance.\n\nAcross risk assets, we are similarly seeing huge delinking, with equities\nrallying greatly and commodities and credit seeing no gains (chart p. 1), very\nmuch unlike last year. Commodities are delinking as there are no growth\nupgrades in EM, and inflation concerns are concentrated on two countries, UK\nand Japan. Credit is delinking as most investors are massively overweight\ncredit versus equities, as evidenced by the disparity in buying flows in 2011-\n12. Relevering by US corporate and the Fed debating the end of QE are\nsignaling that the 3-decade long rally in bonds is likely over. Investors are\nstarting to dollar-average away from bonds to equities.\n\nFixed Income\n\nBonds rallied again, except for Euro area peripherals, the source of this\nweek’s market concerns. The imposition of capital controls on Cypriot\ndeposits is to be sure a watershed moment, but for now not one we expect to\nspark significant deposit withdrawals elsewhere. Meanwhile, the most likely\noutcome to the Italian impasse appears to be new elections in the autumn.\nWith seemingly little prospect of a material rise in yields on the safest assets,\nwe think the search for carry evident across the full gamut of asset markets\nwill see peripheral spreads narrow over time.\n\nTen-year JGB yields have rallied to within a few bps of their all-time low,\nahead of next week’s inaugural meeting for the new BoJ leadership. We do\nindeed expect aggressive easing, with JGB purchases out to 30 years, but\nthink this will be trumped by profit taking in JGBs after the fiscal year end.\n\nOur latest Inflation Expectations Survey (F. Diamond, K. Gupta) was out\nyesterday. One interesting result is that almost 90% of respondents believe the\nBoJ has less than a 50/50 shot of hitting its 2% inflation target in two years, a\nreflection of the formidable challenge of sparking inflation expectations after\ntwo decades of falling prices.\n\nJ.P Morgan\n\n2013 Japan GDP growth forecasts: JPMorgan and\n\nConsensus\n2.0\n1.8\n1.6\n1.4\n1.2\n1.0\n0.8\n0.6\n0.4\n0.2\n0.0\n\nJan-12 9 Apr-12— Jul-12) = Oct-12.
