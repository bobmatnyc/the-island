Hi Darren:
I hope you are well.

Since we are no longer working for Jeffrey, ’'m forwarding this Daily News request to you so you can handle it as you see
fit.

Many thanks,

Howard

Howard:

We’re working on a story for our Sunday column about Jeffrey Epstein. I thought I might send
my questions to you tonight, so you’d have them first thing tomorrow.
