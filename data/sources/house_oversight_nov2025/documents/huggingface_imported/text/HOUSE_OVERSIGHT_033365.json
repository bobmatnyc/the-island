  "text": "5/29/2019 Opinion | Trump Hands China an Easy Win in the Trade War - The New York Times\n\nEhe New ork Gimes\n\nTrump Hands China an Easy\nWin in the Trade War\n\nThe president's tough rhetoric plays into Chinese economic\nnationalism.\n\nBy Kevin Rudd\n\nMr. Rudd, a former prime minister of Australia, is the president of the Asia Society Policy\nInstitute.\n\nMay 29, 2019\n\nWhen President Trump tweeted on May 5 that the China trade deal was off, the historical echoes\nin Beijing were loud and clear. Almost exactly 100 years earlier, China’s “May Fourth Movement”\nof 1919 was a direct response to the actions of President Woodrow Wilson at the end of World War\nI. Wilson had promised China, an American ally, that German colonies in Shandong would be\nreturned to Chinese sovereignty, but instead handed them to Japan. China exploded with anti-\nAmerican, nationalist sentiment. One of the eventual consequences was the establishment of the\nChinese Communist Party, which for the last 70 years has ruled the country.\n\nThus, Mr. Trump has handed Xi Jinping a remarkably effective nationalist card to play at a time\nwhen he has been under pressure at home because of a slowing economy. The Chinese media is\nnow full of accounts of the country’s economic resilience and appeals to patriotism, even invoking\nthe spirit of the Korean War, when, according to the official narrative, China was able to stare\ndown the vastly superior American military.\n\nAnd just in case people didn’t get the point, Mr. Xi recently visited Jiangxi, the starting point of\nthe Long March in 1934, in which the Communist Party endured many hardships but ultimately\nemerged victorious.\n\nI can almost hear members of the Trump administration groaning. Why on earth would they need\nto take into consideration events in China’s ancient past?\n\nThe answer depends on what Mr. Trump’s primary objective is. If it’s to sound tough to American\nvoters, he may well have a winning formula. But if it’s to bring about a substantive change in\nChina’s negotiating posture toward a bilateral trade agreement, one that might usher in changes\nin China’s trade policy, addressing questions of forced technology transfers, intellectual property\ntheft, industrial subsidies, currency manipulation and a phalanx of other non-tariff barriers, I’m\nnot so sure.\n\nhttps:/Avww.nytimes.com/2019/05/29/opinion/trump-china-trade-war.html 1/3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033365",
