  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\nof criticism in the media to justify a tenuous claim\nof pluralism. In recent years, tolerance for ideas\nand opinions that are not aligned with those of\nthe regime has steadily eroded. In Russia, a bad\nsituation became much worse after the invasion\nof Ukraine in 2014. Those who criticized or even\nraised questions about the morality or wisdom of\nthe Kremlin's actions were persecuted, dismissed\nfrom employment, and banned from media com-\nmentary. Putin also expanded the zone of media\ncontrol from the mainstream television and print\nsectors to the internet.\n\nIn Venezuela, one opposition or independent\nvoice after another has been neutralized, as key\nnewspapers and television stations were sold,\nunder duress, to businessmen with ties to the\ngovernment. The new and often opaque owners\ngenerally watered down political reporting and\nforced out prominent journalists.’\n\nEven before the 2016 coup attempt, media free-\ndom in Turkey was deteriorating at an alarming\nrate. The government, controlled by President\nRecep Tayyip Erdogan’s Justice and Develop-\nment Party, aggressively used the penal code,\ncriminal defamation legislation, and antiterror-\nism laws to punish critical reporting. Journal-\nists also faced growing violence, harassment,\nand intimidation from both state and nonstate\nactors. The authorities also used financial and\nadministrative leverage over media owners to\ninfluence coverage and muzzle dissent.’\n\nWar propaganda: For some time, propaganda\nfrom Russia, China, and other authoritarian\ncountries stressed a hostility toward liberal val-\nues and democracy, framed around a relentless\nanti-Americanism. There were, however, certain\nredlines that propagandists were unlikely to\ncross. They would criticize American foreign\npolicy and blame it for a country’s problems.\n\nBut only rarely would they accuse Washington\nof warlike intentions, and they seldom if ever\nmade military threats themselves. Since the\ninvasion of Ukraine and the resulting economic\nsanctions imposed by the United States and the\nEU, Russian propaganda has assumed an uglier,\nmore menacing tone. The same Is true in China,\nwhere official expressions of hostility toward the\nUnited States and “Western” democratic values\nintensified—indeed took on a histrionic and\nbelligerent character—after the ascension of Xi\n\nJinping as Communist Party leader. In Turkey,\nprogovernment commentators have accused\nthe U.S. government and even an American\nthink tank of involvement in the failed coup of\n2016. °\n\nClosing doors to the outside world: More\n\nthan anything else, modern authoritarianism is\ndistinguished from traditional autocracy by its\nopenness to relatively normal relations with the\noutside world. China, for example, long sought\nto balance calibrated repression at home with\nparticipation in an impressive array of global in-\nstitutions. Beijing welcomed the establishment\nof local branches of foreign, mostly American,\nuniversities, joint research ventures with foreign\nscholars, and even the involvement of foreign\nNGOs in areas such as legal reform and envi-\nronmental conservation. While more ambiv-\nalent about the international media, Chinese\nauthorities did give unprecedented freedom of\nmovement to foreign journalists in the period\nsurrounding the 2008 Beijing Olympics. Russia\nwas less welcoming to foreign involvement in\nthe country, whether by governmental or private\nentities, but for a time it maintained academic\nexchanges with the United States and European\ncountries, grudgingly tolerated foreign NGOs,\nand took some pride in the freedom of Russians\nto travel freely abroad.\n\nConditions have deteriorated over the past\nseveral years. In Russia, the government re-\nduced trade with Europe in response to sanc-\ntions, imposed travel restrictions on millions of\npublic-sector employees, smeared domestic\nhuman rights organizations as “foreign agents”\nfor accepting international funding, and began\nblacklisting foreign NGOs as “undesirable.” Chi-\nna has increased regulatory and legal pressure\non foreign companies, bullied foreign countries\ninto repatriating Chinese political refugees,\nsignificantly increased regulatory restrictions on\nforeign NGOs, and sharply curbed journalistic\nfreedom for foreign correspondents.\n\nPropaganda and official rhetoric in both\ncountries has increasingly portrayed them as\nbesieged fortresses, threatened on all sides by\nhostile foreign powers, spies, separatists, and\ntraitors who seek to topple the government and\ndeny the nation its rightful place in the world. In\nthis environment, any interaction with foreigners\n\n54\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019288",
