  "text": "The South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu, and the ADIZ\n\nSome may argue that China is clearly adopting a more assertive policy in\nEast Asia — using the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands\ndispute, or the Air Defense Identification Zone as examples. However,\nthere is a difference, and this has to do with the “sphere of influence” of\nChina and, more specifically, with the sovereignty and integrity of\nChinese national territory (as Beijing defines it). For the CCP, the Syrian\ncrisis is a “pure” foreign policy issue, as the Chinese government has no\nterritorial claim in Syria or in the Middle East in general. On the other\nhand, Beijing has always considered the South China Sea and the\nSenkaku/Diaoyu islands as part of its sphere of influence and by\nvigorously defending its claims on those territorial disputes, the CCP\npurports to do nothing but protect its territorial integrity. It’s arguable that\nthis concern with territory has been the very first priority of China\nthroughout its history. The debate over the East China Sea ADIZ, which\nChina established in November, can also be related to the territorial\nintegrity of the Middle Kingdom. However, Western criticisms should be\nbalanced against the knowledge that the ADIZ is an American invention\n(1950), which South Korea (1951) and Japan (1969) adopted long before\nChina did. At any rate, the South China Sea, the Senkaku/Diaoyu islands,\nand the ADIZ issues are domestic issues for the CCP, rather than “pure”\nforeign policy matters.\n\nThis article doesn’t seek to take a normative position. Rather, the point is\nthat in the Syrian crisis China has followed a consistent foreign policy, in\nline with its principles and traditions. The outcome of this policy may not\nsatisfy many Western actors, but that is not enough to accuse China of\nfollowing a more assertive foreign policy toward Western powers and the\nU.S. in particular. Of course, the new status of China in the international\ncommunity allows it to make its voice heard, instead of the silence that\nmay have prevailed before its economic arrival. But the considerations of\nthe CCP as it formulates its foreign policy have remained the same since\nthe creation of the PRC. In the future, China is likely to be more capable\nof achieving its goals in its “domestic” Northeast Asian claims, but there\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031589",
