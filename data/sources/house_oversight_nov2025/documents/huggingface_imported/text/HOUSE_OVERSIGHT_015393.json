  "text": "When my young daughter Holly came out to stay with me that\nsummer, she decided to join me on my silent day. We communicated with\nhandwritten notes. Holly wrote, Does /aughter count? Since we were\nmaking up the rules as we went along, | answered, Yes, but no tickling.\nNaturally she tried to make me laugh, but | held it in - and got a rush.\n\nAll the energy that normally gets dissipated into the air with\nlaughter seemed to surge through my body instead. | decided to stop\nlaughing altogether, just to see what would happen. The more | didn't\nlaugh, the more | found funny. And, paying closer attention to others, |\nrefined my appreciation of laughter as another whole language that could\noften be more revealing than words. Sometimes | would get a twinge of\nguilt if | nearly slipped and laughed, and | remembered what | had always\nknown, that children must be taught to be serious. When | mentioned my\nlaugh-fast to Dick Gregory, still on his food-fast, it didn't sound so far-\nfetched to him.\n\nThat's two things people do out of insecurity,” he said. “Eating\nand laughing.”\n\n“Well, what would happen to us if everyone in our audiences\nrealized that?”\n\n“Brother, we'd go out of business.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015393",
