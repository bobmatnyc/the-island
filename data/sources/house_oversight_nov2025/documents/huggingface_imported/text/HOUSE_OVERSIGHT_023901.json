  "text": "Defining Intelligence 155\n\none must be able to explain one’s reasoning clearly to those who ask.\nAnd, one must have a knowledge base of relevant information to draw\nupon. But our education system, in concentrating only on the knowl-\nedge base and not on independent reasoning from that knowledge\nbase, has ensured that the knowledge base remains incomprehensible\nto most people and therefore is immediately forgotten after school is\nover.\n\nIt would be a good idea to eliminate IQ tests as a measure of intel-\nligence and begin to teach people to do diagnosis, to plan well, to be\nable to determine causality, and to clearly explain their reasoning to\nothers.\n\nThose that cannot learn to do this would rightly be called stupid,\nbut those who can would rightly be called intelligent.\n\nDegrees of intelligence would be about one’s ability to do this for\nmore and more complex issues in complex domains.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023901",
