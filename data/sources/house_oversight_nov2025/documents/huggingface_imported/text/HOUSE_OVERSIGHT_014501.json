When correc-\ntions officers pulled apart the sneak-\ners, they discovered two small plastic\nbags of marijuana, according to the\npress release.\n\nAny material that ends up in the\nhands of prisoners is thoroughly\nsearched as a matter of routine, Mull-\ngrav said.\n\n“We search any item that goes to\nthe inmates,” he said. “Generally\n\nspeaking, it’s pretty thorough.”\n\nGordon, 32, has been in jail\nsince police charged him with first-\ndegree attempted murder and first-\ndegree assault following a Nov. 29\nshooting on St. Croix, authorities\nhave said.\n\nGordon’s name also matches that\nof a man charged in 2010 with the\nmurder of 19-year-old Kendal Wood.\nGordon’s trial languished in the Su-\nperior Court on St. Croix for almost\nthree years, and he was most recently\ngranted a continuance in 2013.\n\nThe disposition of the murder\ncase involving Gordon couldn’t be\nimmediately ascertained Monday\nevening.\n\nGordon had been released on elec-\ntronic monitoring and house arrest\npending trial in 2013, according to\ncourt documents at the time.\n\nHe was being held on $500,000\nbail in his most recent arrest, police\nsaid.\n\n— Contact Brian O’Connor at\n340-714-9130 or email boconnor@\ndailynews.vi.\n\nFederal judges from Philadelphia in the Virgin Islands to hear cases\n\nBy BRIAN O’CONNOR\nDaily News Staff\n\nThe 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Ap-\npeals will sit this week in the federal\ncourthouse on St. Thomas.\n\nJudges Kent Jordan, Michael Cha-\ngares and Thomas Hardiman will hear\na range of appellate cases, ranging\nfrom a local prisoner challenging his\ndetention as unconstitutional to an es-\n\ntate battle over an inheritance in which\ntwo separate federal cases were merged\ninto one.\n\nThe judges fly in from Philadelphia\nto hear argument on issues they decide\nat a later date.\n\nAppellate court argument is based\naround rapid-fire questions from the\nempaneled judges, unlike civil or\ncriminal court, which frequently is\ndominated by long exchanges between\n\nattorneys and witnesses.\n\nThe appellant attorney gets four min-\nutes to make a case, followed by four\nminutes from the appellee, followed by\nfour minutes of rebuttal from the appel-\nlant attorney, though judges’ questions\ncan sometimes turn four minutes into\neight.\n\nFor example, Ronald Gillette, incar-\ncerated in 2008 on multiple counts of\naggravated rape and unlawful sexual\n\nSince 1985 NATURAL FOOD Grocery & Deli\n\nVeggie Burgers » Vegan Soups « Salads « Spinach Lasagna\nBroccoli Quiche « Daily Vegan Platter « Organic Carrot Juice\n\nWheat Grass Juice » Huge Deli Sandwiches\n\nGet Order To Go: |\n(340) 775-3737\n\nMandela Circle\nSt. Thomas\n\nWhy buy your vehicle from STRAKER MOTORS?......\n\n- Friendly and honest sales staff\n\n: No high pressure sales tactics\n\n* Huge inventory of extra clean\n\npre-owned vehicles\n\n* The most popular makes and\nmodels of Cars, SUV's, Trucks\n\n* On the spot financing makes\n\nbuying easy\n\n- Locally owned and operated\n\n+ FREE SHIPPING TO ST. THOMAS\n\nSTRAKER\nMOTORS\n\n254 Estate Glynn, Northside Road, St. Croix\n340-713-2277\nwww.strakermotors.com\n\ncontact against two children, is seeking\nan appeal on a motion denying his re-\nlease from custody.\n\nGillette’s attorney, Joseph DiRuzzo\nIII, began on Monday by making his\ncase that the motion, ordered by Chief\nDistrict Court Judge Wilma Lewis,\nconstituted a final judgement and thus\nwas worthy of an appeal. DiRuzzo\nsought a three-judge panel to overturn\nLewis's order.\n\nIt didn’t take long for Jordan to ask\na question.\n\n“How can it be a final order if there\nare still claims in the case, if you’re still\nseeking relief, which you are?” he said.\n\nDiRuzzo had a response.\n\n“The denial of a three-judge panel\neffectively throws Mr. Gillette out of\ncourt,” he said. He started to add to this,\nbut Jordan cut him off.\n\n“There are claims for relief, they still\nexist,” he said. “I’m struggling to see\nhow this is a final judgement.”\n\nOrders relating to the change in\nthe reduction of a prison population\nessentially rely on three-judge pan-\nels to be valid, DiRuzzo said. Pris-\non orders issued by a single judge\nare subject to challenge on appeal,\nDiRuzzo said.\n\n“IT would submit that three-judge\ncourts are desirable in confrontations\nbetween state and federal power,” he\nsaid.\n\nKimberly Salisbury was the Assis-\ntant Attorney General arguing for the\nappellee. Her job on Monday was to\ntell three federal judges that it wasn’t\ntheir job to decide Gillette’s case.\n\n“This particular order is just simply\nnot final,” she said, at one point.\n\nHowever, Hardiman had a question.\n\nIf there was an order short of Gil-\nlette’s release that could make the\nprison resolve the Eighth Amendment\nviolations that put the prison under a\nfederal consent decree for decades to\nresolve, Lewis or another judge could\nstill make the determination. The pris-\non has completed only 14 percent of\nthe new consent decree ordered in 2013\naccording to testimony.\n\n“What would that order look like?”\nHardiman asked.\n\nSalisbury struggled with an answer.\n\nJordan tried to steer the argument\nback to the facts of the case.\n\n“Does the fact that a 2013 consent\ndecree superseded and replaced the\noriginal, does it mean the three decades\nof prior noncompliance is to be ig-\nnored?” he said. “You're not even a fifth\nof the way completed. At what point is\nenough enough?”\n\nComplying with the consent decree\nwill take time, Salisbury said.\n\n“According to the Bureau of Correc-\ntions, we're not there yet,” she said.\n\nChagares jumped in, and compared\nGolden Grove Adult Correctional Fa-\ncility to a luxury cruise liner.\n\n“Tt’s like your big cruise ships out in\nthe bay,” he said. “It takes a long time\nto turn around. But this is a really long\ntime.”\n\nHearings will continue today before\nthe Third Circuit at the DeLugo Federal\nBuilding on St. Thomas at 9 a.m. An-\nother session is set for Thursday start-\ning at 10:30 a.m.\n\n— Contact Brian O’Connor at\n340-714-9130 or email boconnor@\ndailynews.vi.\n\nCaribbean Lottery\n\nPick 3 (Dec. 12) _\nMorning\n\n1st prize 5\n\nMidday\n\n1st prize 8\n\nSunset\n\n1st prize\n\nEvening\n\n1st prize\n\nMorning\n1st prize\nMidday\n\n1st prize\nSunset\n\n1st prize\nEvening\n1st prize\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014501\n\nPick 4 (Dec. 12)\n\nMega Millions\n(Dec. 9) Next draw: Tonight\n19 27 47 67 68\nMega Ball: 1\n\nPowerball\n\n(Dec. 10) Next draw:\nWednesday\n\n12 21 32 44 66\nPowerball: 15\n\n4362\n\n2304\n\n8096\n\n7580",
