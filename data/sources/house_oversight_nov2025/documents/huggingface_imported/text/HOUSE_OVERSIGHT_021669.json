  "text": "~ Jeffrey Epstein, Billionaire eo Goes Free - The Daily Beast\n\nPage 1 of 4\n@\n\nPRINT\nI! BLOGS & STORIES\nBillionaire Pedophile Goes Free\nby Conchita Sarnoff\n\nJuly 20, 2010 | 11:05pm\n\nREAD THIS SKIP THAT\n\nHedge fund mogul Jeffrey Epstein became a free man Wednesday, five years after he was first\naccused of sexually abusing underage girls. After months of reporting, The Daily Beast’s\nConchita Sarnoff reveals exclusive details of the investigation and the legal wrangling that saved\nhim from a long prison term. She reports:\n\n* Palm Beach's police chief objected to Epstein’s “special treatment” and gave The Daily Beast an\nexclusive look at his nine-hour deposition about the investigation.\n\n¢ Earlier versions of the U.S attorney’s charges, including a sealed 53-page indictment, could have\nlanded Epstein in prison for 20 years.\n\n¢ Victims alleged that Epstein molested underage girls from South America, Europe, and the former\nSoviet republics, including three 12-year-old girls brought over from France as a birthday gift.\n\n* The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein’s private jets, which would be\nevidence of sex trafficking—a much more serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was\nconvicted of.\n\n« Epstein’s attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered\nprivate investigators to follow and intimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.\n\n* Then-Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told The Daily Beast that he “would have instructed the\nJustice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.”\n\nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of\nprivilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach,\nwhich has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\n\nDuring Epstein’s term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private\nCaribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—13 months in the Palm\nBeach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen\nlawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven\nvictims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an\namount that will hardly dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\n\nWith that, the known victims of Epstein’s sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is\nclosed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving assets out of the U.S. and\nmay well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile.\n\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis\n\nSiE-ma-lo%oba WIQXL,\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-20/jeffrey-epstein-billionaire-ped... 7/23/2010\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021669",
