  "text": "in the late 1970s. A meritocracy on steroids, or, as\nVanity Fair would baldly dub it, the new establishment,\nan increasingly parallel world, a self-invented one, at\nfurther and further remove from the ordinary one.\nEpstein’s is just one version, albeit picaresque and\nlouche, of this shared story.\n\nEpstein often tells, with some obvious marvel, his\nmiddle class to riches tale: born in 1953 in Coney\nIsland, father worked for the city’s Parks Department,\nmother a housewife.\n\nThe captain of the math team at Lafayette High\nschool in Bensonhurst, he went on to Cooper Union\nwhere the tuition is free. He dropped out after two years\nand began taking classes at the NYU’s Courant Institute\nof Mathematics. Then, without a college degree, hence\nby a slight of hand, he got a job teaching math and\nphysics at Dalton in 1974. (A few years ago, during a\nchance encounter with a former Dalton math department\nchairman, Margo Gumport, I asked her about Epstein.\nShe said he was the most brilliant math teacher at\nDalton in her 50-year career and that she had often\nwondered what had become of him.)\n\nDalton was his first exposure to the wealthy. They\nhave, he concluded, just as many problems as the people\nin Coney Island, but different ones, almost invariably\ninvolving divorce and money. “I found it interesting as a\nscience experiment,” he recalled recently as we chatted\nabout his life. “It did not really involve me. I could just\nstand back and watch.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022909",
