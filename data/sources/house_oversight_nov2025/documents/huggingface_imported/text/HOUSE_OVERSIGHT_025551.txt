Can Alts Unlock Value with
C-Corp Conversions °

We think APO could unlock the most value by converting to a C-corp with 26%
in our upside case vs. -14% in our downside case. ARES could be the first to
convert, but this is largely priced in. These firms have more sticky management
fee-related earnings vs. BX/CG/KKR that may see Less benefit.
