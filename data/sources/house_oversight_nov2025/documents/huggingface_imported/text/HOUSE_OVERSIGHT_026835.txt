Congratulations Vinoda ! The French version of the paper was published today in the Senegalese major
newspapers. You can see it also in Seneweb.com .

Many thanks for the good work with my best regards.

Objet : RE: Revised letter. Arbitrary detention of Mr. Wade

We have had some positive feedback from the article. Now the issue certainly has more visibility in Washington. Bob is
in the process of setting up the meeting with Tom at the State Dept regarding the Human Rights Report for 2016. Will
send more as we get more details.
