  "text": "Suppose for example that cash flow rate is known to be 4%. Using (7.2), we would\n\nfigure\n\n1 100\nyears purchase = —_———— = yer oN 2 SO 525 years.\nA%/year 4% 4/100 4.\nThat allows (7.1) to be reexpressed as\ncapital = (cash flow) x (years purchase). (7.3)\n\nWhere cash flow and cash flow rate are assumed constant over time, they become\nidentical to profit and rate of return. Sumerians realized that return is the universal\nmaximand, three millennia before Turgot wrote that down, and that competition\ntended to equalize it to a current market norm. Then it would also equal years\n\npurchase.\n\nPetty was searching for the rationale of years purchase, and found it in the\n\ngeneration length. Petty’s idea I think, and mine anyhow, could begin with\n\ncapital = means of accomplishing goals= means of lineage survival= fitness. (7.4)\n\nNature’s way is transmission of all fitness, meaning total capital for humans, to the\nnext generation. Nature cares just as much for later generations, but trusts each\ngeneration of immediate descendants to know best what their own immediate\ndescendants will need for that long-range goal. Each passes the baton and retires.\nWe invest everything in the next generaton precisely because we care about the\n\nones after. Hamilton’s rule reflects this reality. Grandoffspring are only % related to\n\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 18\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011077",
