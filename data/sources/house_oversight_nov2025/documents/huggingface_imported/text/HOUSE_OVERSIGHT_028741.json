  "text": "NYT\n\nAn Assassination in Tunisia\nEditorial\n\nFebruary 8, 2013 -- Tunisia is where the Arab Spring began just over two\nyears ago. Until now it has set an encouraging example of progress toward\ndemocracy and pluralism. Free elections brought to power a coalition\ngovernment pledged to pragmatic cooperation between a moderate-led\nIslamist party, Ennahda, and smaller, secular coalition partners.\n\nProgress has not always been smooth. But just as Tunisians inspired\npeople in neighboring countries like Egypt and Libya to rise up against\ntheir corrupt and repressive dictators, they also seemed, for many, to point\nthe way toward a democratic future accommodating both religious beliefs\nand the rights of the secular under the rule of law.\n\nThose hopes have been severely shaken by the murder on Wednesday of\nChokri Belaid. Mr. Belaid, a human- rights activist and one of Ennahda’s\nmost outspoken critics, had publicly challenged the party’s failure to\ninvestigate or prosecute violent acts of intimidation carried out by\nshadowy gangs of religious extremists. Mr. Belaid’s killers have not yet\nbeen identified. But suspicion now falls on those same extremist groups,\nwhich had issued public threats against Mr. Belaid and other prominent\nsecular leaders — without any serious government response.\n\nThousands gathered for Mr. Belaid’s funeral on Friday amid a nationwide\ngeneral strike called by his trade union supporters. Tensions are high.\nWhat is urgently needed is a credible, independent investigation of Mr.\nBelaid’s murder, followed by prosecution of the killers.\n\nGiven Ennahda’s record of selectively ignoring Islamist violence, that\ninvestigation cannot be left to its appointees alone. A preferable\nalternative would be to reconstitute the broad-based, multiparty\ncommissions that successfully oversaw Tunisia’s free elections in October\n2011 and investigated the crimes of the fallen dictatorship.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028741",
