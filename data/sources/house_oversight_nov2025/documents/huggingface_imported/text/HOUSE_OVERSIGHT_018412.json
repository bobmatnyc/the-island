  "text": "before such a fork appears. This approach, too, has its logical problems. Boxing the\nlargest economy in the world hardly seems sensible - and is likely not achievable.\nAnyhow, early attempts to do so have shown how little leverage the US has. When\nChina announced plans to build an Asian Investment and Infrastructure Bank in\n2014, the US opposed it and then watched as nearly all of Washington’s traditional\nallies raced to join.\n\nAt the same time, China’s policy towards the US has been hard to decipher for many:\nIs the country intent on amity or enmity? It’s clear enough that the American\noptions presented to Beijing are unappetizing: Change or be contained. Messages by\nChina in response have tickled the natural historical pessimism of American political\nleaders. China speaks of wanting a new kind of relations with America, of cultivating\nrich technological and financial ties, but the country at the same moment challenges\neasy assumptions about how foreign investment, educational or security\ncooperation might mesh together like gears of friendly progress. It’s hard to do\nbusiness in the Mainland. The military grows with astonishing speed. Domestic\nhabits of smash-mouth competition rattle at more sedate Western habits. Any\nelement of China’s actions are explainable and even sensible when seen with\nsympathetic eyes — but the same exact facts can be stitched into a story that suggests\nconstant damage to American interests. China’s position is, to be honest, a difficult\none: The country is opaque to most foreigners, wrapped in habits and instincts that\nrun along such different lines that even simple daily decisions - how to runa\nmeeting, for example - can be a source of disagreement. Jn the west you prize\ndiamonds for their clarity, Chinese will say, in China we prize jade because it is cloudy.\nThere’s a charm in opacity; even a bit of sensible political magic at times. But China\nis moving out into the world very rapidly, now: Fast and dimly understood don’t\nfuse into easy trust.\n\nIn one sense, then, it’s possible to sense the tense, angry energy of an impending\ncollision. Beijing and Washington are enacting the old historical pattern. Wrestling\nfor years over small issues, never quite coming to grips, slowly pulling at each other\nuntil a final, fatal collapse. Germany and Great Britain, all over again. But: Connection\nchanges the nature of an object. So much in our world looks different after connected\ndynamics are applied. Might connection change the nature of enmity? We are, after\nall, part of the same connected skein. We've concluded that America’s greatest\nthreat is not China or Russia or terrorism - but the evolution of the network itself.\nThat same topological evolution menaces Beijing too. If China is not our biggest\nenemy, if we are not theirs - what might be developed? Might the rat trap of history\nremain unsprung?\n\nAn American “China Policy” shouldn’t be regarded as some distinct initiative; rather\nit must be a part of a grand strategic program of Hard Gatekeeping. Our goal aim\nisn’t some shimmeringly perfect “China Policy” so much as it is to cultivate a grand\nstrategic disposition that informs what we undertake in cyber, Russia, the Middle\nEast, and China. Imagine we had a terrific “China policy” and a backfiring “Nuclear\nweapons policy”? Masterful grand strategy is marked by a comprehensive elegance.\nMetternich’s old construction, “A Concert of Nations” tells the story pretty well: A\n\n180\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018412",
