We go on 300 pages or so in the\n\ndeposition, and it is clear from the transcript that when we\nget back to the police report issue again, Ms. Maxwell is being\nasked questions by Ms. McCawley. Ms. McCawley says -- and this\n\nis at page 169, lines 4 through 8 -- \"Now that you have the\n\npolice report that I showed you this morning that you had an\n\nv\n\nopportunity to look at it,\" and Ms. Maxwell responds, \"You gave\n\nit to me. I did not look at it.\" And there was no really\n\nother questioning at the deposition about Ms. Maxwell's\n\nknowledge of these police reports.\n\nSo the record on this issue, your Honor, which is\n\ngoing to continue to be the record, is that Ms. Maxwell has no\n\nknowledge of this police report, the investigation, anything\n\nthat's going on with Mr. Epstein substantively during this\n\ninvestigation by the Palm Beach Police Department. So that's\n\nwhy it's not admissible. They try to cobble together what they\n\nview as sort of indicia of she should have known about what's\n\nin these police reports, and they first of all say -- we get\n\nback to this Dershowitz joint defense agreement issue, which I\ntouched on yesterday, but you're going to hear it again today,\nso I think it's worth mentioning again. And here are the\n\nquotes exactly from Mr. Dershowitz' deposition.\n\nMr. Dershowitz -- somebody objects during this deposition, and\n\nthen there's a colloquy. There's an assertion of privilege.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011420",
