  "text": "In March 2011 tens of thousands of demonstrators took to the streets in Syria. The\nprotestors were demanding political reforms, dissatisfied with the cruel and\nauthoritarian regime of Bashar al-Assad, who has been in power for more than ten\nyears, succeeding his father after a 30-year rule. The government responded by\nopening fire. Within a few months, a peaceful uprising grew into a full-scale civil\nwar, which has lasted for more than two years and is unlikely to end soon. This\nAugust, the death toll in Syria has reached 100,000. More than a quarter of the 22\nmillion population has been displaced, hundreds of thousands of refugees have left\n\nthe country.\n\nThe United States has been supporting the opposition, supplying it with food and\nmedical aid, but refraining from military intervention and from providing the rebels\nwith weapons. The Obama administration claimed that the US would not intervene\nunless it had strong evidence of chemical weapons used by the Assad regime. In June\n2013, Washington concluded that chemical weapons, including nerve agent sarin,\nclassified by The United Nations as a weapon of mass destruction, had been used.\nThe White House announced for the first time in June that it was going to send\n\nweapons to the opposition. Congress vetoed this resolution.\n\nThere are many reasons why the US should refrain from providing the opposition\nwith weapons. Over the two years of military confrontation, the situation on the\nground has become increasingly chaotic. It is important to understand that there is\n\nno united opposition capable of overthrowing / toppling Assad’s regime. Instead,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030825",
