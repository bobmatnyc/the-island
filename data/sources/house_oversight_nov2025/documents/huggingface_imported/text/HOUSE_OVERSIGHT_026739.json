  "text": "Few doubt that machines will gradually surpass more and more of our distinctively\nhuman capabilities — or enhance them via cyborg technology. Disagreements are\nbasically about the timescale — the rate of travel, not the direction of travel. The\ncautious amongst us envisage timescales of centuries rather than decades before\nhumans are overtaken or transcended by electronic intelligence — far transcending the\nchemical and metabolic limits of ‘wet’ organic brains. These entities will then persist,\ncontinuing to evolve, for billions of years. Moreover, the timescales for technological\nadvance are but an instant compared to the slow timescales of the Darwinian\nselection that led to humanity’s emergence — and (more relevantly) they are less than\na millionth of the vast expanses of cosmic time lying ahead.\n\nBut we humans shouldn’t feel too humbled. Even though we are surely not the\nterminal branch of an evolutionary tree, we could be of special cosmic significance\nfor jump-starting the transition to inorganic (and potentially immortal) entities,\nspreading their influence far beyond the Earth, and far transcending our limitations.\n\nMoreover, a planetary environment may suit us ‘organics’ — but interplanetary and\ninterstellar space may be the preferred arena where robotic fabricators will have the\ngrandest scope for construction, and where non-biological ‘brains’ may develop\npowers than humans can’t even imagine.\n\nAnd they could spread through the cosmos — interstellar travel isn’t daunting to near-\nimmortal beings.\n\nIs there life out there already? Or is the Galaxy waiting for our progeny? We know\nthere’s nowhere in our solar system that harbours advanced life. However there may\nbe freeze-dried bacteria on Mars.\n\nThere may be creatures swimming under the Ice on Saturn’s moon Enceladus.\n\nBut let’s widen our horizons to the realm of the stars.\n\nThe prime subject-matter of the Carl Sagan Institute would have enthralled Carl.\nWe've learnt that most stars in the sky are orbited by retinues of planets, like the\nSun is . But the evidence is mainly indirect; we don’t observe the planet, but detect its\ninfluence on the motion or brightness of the star it’s orbiting\n\nThe Carl Sagan Institute is specially interested in possible 'twins' of our Earth --\n\nplanets the same size as ours, on orbits with temperatures such that water neither\nboils nor stays frozen.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026739",
