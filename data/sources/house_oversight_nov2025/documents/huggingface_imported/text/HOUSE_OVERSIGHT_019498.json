When I asked my consulate source whether the\nU.S. mission took any action to track Snowden during these thirteen\ndays, he explained that the FBI had long maintained a contingent\nof “legal attachés” based at the consulate to pursue many possible\nviolations of U.S. law including video piracy. In addition, the CIA\nand the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) had retained a handful of\n“China watchers” under diplomatic cover in Hong Kong. This group\nconstituted the “intelligence mission,” as he referred to it. It had\ndeveloped informal relations with the Hong Kong police that, along\nwith the NSA’s electronic capabilities abroad, allowed it to track\nSnowden’s movements after he had outed himself on the video.\nBecause Snowden, his lawyers, and the journalists in his entourage\nfrequently used their cell phones to text one another, it was fairly\neasy for the U.S. intelligence mission to follow Snowden’s trail after\nhe left the Mira hotel.

I mentioned that there was a report in a Russian newspa-\nper that Snowden had visited the Russian consulate in late June in\nconnection with the flight he later took to Moscow. “All we know is\nhe entered the building,” he answered, with a shrug.\n\nThat Russian consulate visit did not come as a complete surprise\nto U.S. intelligence. After Snowden left the Mira, his interactions\nwith the Russian and Chinese intelligence services in Hong Kong\nhad been closely monitored by “secret means,” a term that in that\ncontext likely indicated electronic surveillance. A former top intel-\nligence executive in Washington, D.C., subsequently confirmed this\nmonitoring to me.
