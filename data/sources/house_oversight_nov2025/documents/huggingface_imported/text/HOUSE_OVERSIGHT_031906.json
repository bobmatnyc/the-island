  "text": "si\n\nafterthought, and that’s what stuck in people’s minds. That was a\nmistake, because it kind of undermined the notion of democracy\n\npromotion, simply because it was connected to a very unpopular\n\nintervention.\n\nSHAFFER: Taking lessons from that, what can we do to promote\ndemocracy in the aftermath of the “Arab Spring’?\n\nFUKUYAMA: We already are doing a lot. We’ve got organizations\nlike the National Democratic Institute, or the International\nRepublican Institute, that are all over Tunisia and Egypt and Libya,\nand other places, trying to help them organize political parties, trade\nunions, civil-society organizations, that hopefully will allow the more\nWestern-oriented democrats in those Arab countries to actually\ncontest in the elections. As we move toward votes in Tunisia and\nEgypt we want to have some alternative to the Muslim Brotherhood\nand the military. So we’re giving them that kind of assistance right\nnow. That’s difficult, because they haven’t had experience with\ndemocracy previously.\n\nIt’s a long-term struggle, and I think we’ll be disappointed in the\nshort run. I don’t think the more pro-Western forces are the ones that\nwill end up on top in the short-run. But we’ve got to start somewhere.\n\nSHAFFER: Is the spread of liberal democracy dependent upon\npersisting American hegemony?\n\nFUKUYAMA: It’s been helpful. The U.S. obviously plays a big role\nin maintaining a liberal, open world order, through its alliances and\nthe influence it projects. And American ideas have been very\ndominant in the world especially in the last two decades. A lot of that\nis shifting now because of the rise of other powers and other ideas.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031906",
