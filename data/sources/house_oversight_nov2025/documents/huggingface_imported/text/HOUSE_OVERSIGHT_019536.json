  "text": "48 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nreason why NSA documents remained secrets, as all intelligence\nworkers at Dell were told when they signed their oath to protect\nNSA secrets, was that the unauthorized release of communications\nintelligence documents would violate U.S. espionage laws. Even so,\nthere was no shortage of activists overseas, such as Assange, who\nwould be willing to publish NSA documents revealing its global sur-\nveillance activities. Cyberpunks, as these activists called themselves,\ntended to be hostile to the NSA because they believed (correctly)\nthat it monitored their activities on the Internet. This anti-NSA\nview was well represented at the Chaos Computer Club convention\nin Berlin in 2012. In addressing these cyberpunks, Assange and his\nfollowers at WikiLeaks declared that the main enemy in cyberspace\nwas the NSA. The NSA documents Snowden had taken were far\nmore explosive than anything Assange had posted to date because\nthey contained NSA intelligence source material.\n\nIn the late fall of 2012, Snowden further tested his newly found\npowers. Using an alias, he reached out to some of the leading hack-\ntivists. It opened a door for him to the darker side of cyberspace.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 48 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019536",
