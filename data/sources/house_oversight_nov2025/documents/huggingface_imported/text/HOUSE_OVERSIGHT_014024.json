This is important information for families who still fear the\noutdated negatives on Third Culture Kids (TCK) based on studies from the fifties.\n\nMaya Frost?! has excellent information about older kids and even a new paradigm when it comes to\ngoing to university. I think education is one of the things going through a total transition due to the\nInternet, and parents need this info to make important decisions.\n\nWe have had a fantastic experience in going to a local school in Spain that has allowed my child to\nimmerse very deeply in her second language, culture, and literature. More info (in the book) on local\nschools is needed and how to experience it as a family for months at a time.\n\nWe have used local people like a wonderful flamenco teacher for our child and we have also used\nonline sources like our piano teacher in Chicago who teaches our child in Spain via Skype.\n\nE-libraries are very important (especially with a child who is a _ voracious reader).\nHttp://learninfreedom.org/languagebooks.html is an excellent resource on language education with great\nbooks on raising a bilingual child, even if you are a monolingual!\n\n—SOULTRAVELERS3 , a family living abroad and loving it\n\nFINANCIAL MUSING\n\nI graduated from Stanford University and started working in investment banking in July 2006, and, in\na sick way, almost enjoyed it at first. Yes, it was a terrible lifestyle and all, but I was learning a lot and\nmoving up very quickly. I have (had) a type-A personality, so it appealed to me on some level.\n\nAs the year progressed, though, I realized it wasn’t sustainable and that I wanted out... but like so\nmany other people, I failed to take action immediately.\n\nIn May 2007, I was driving home at 3 A.M. one night after having pulled 4—5 all-nighters previously,\nand crashed into a tree on the side of the road. If you’ve never crashed into an inanimate object while\nasleep at the wheel, just imagine waking up five feet from the ground while bungee jumping as the cord\nis about to snap to get an idea of what it feels like.\n\n“At the ER”\n\nThat was the subject line of the e-mail I sent out the next day to my entire office. Luckily, everyone\nunderstood and told me to take a rare three-day weekend. Luckily I survived with no major injuries, but\nat that point I decided it was time for a change.\n\nI met up with some friends for dinner a week or two later and relayed my story. One friend there (who\nrecently quit her job to pursue professional acting—her dream—while selling information products\nonline) told me about this book she recently read called The 4-Hour Workweek.\n\nI thought it was a scam, of course, but I really hated my life and decided I needed to check it out at the\nvery least. I read it in one sitting. And then I read it again, just to make sure I wasn’t hallucinating.\nBefore ever getting into finance, I had done some work online with graphics and web design and I had a\ntechnical background, so nothing in the book seemed outrageous to me—I just didn’t realize how easy\nand accessible it all was. Also, I had lived in Japan for half a year in college and loved it—and long-term\nworld travel had always been one of my goals.\n\nI sat on the ideas in your book for a while, took a quick vacation to return to Japan in October 2007,\nand when I came back decided that I had to get started. My muse: sell an investment banking interview\nguide. It’s a niche, high-demand subject and I knew I could make a better guide than anything else out\nthere. One problem: I had to stay anonymous since I was still working, and advertising with Pay-Per-\nClick would be way too expensive given the high CPCs for related keywords.\n\nIn November 2007 I decided to start a blog, Mergers & Inquisitions\n(http://www.mergersandinquisitions.com), about the investment banking industry and how to break in,\naimed at a mix of college students, MBAs, and working professionals.
