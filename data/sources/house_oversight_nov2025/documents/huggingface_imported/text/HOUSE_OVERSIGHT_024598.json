  "text": "?\n\nremarkably inspiring. But with Qadhafi, again, it's always the \"me,\"\nand that goes back to your narcissism. He has a very difficult time, as\nmost narcissists do, empathizing with the pain and suffering of\nothers. Everything is about him.\n\nSo how do you see this playing out for Libya?\n\nWell, it's quite clear that the rebels are in control, but things will not\nreally be fully clarified until Qadhafi is either killed, forced to\nsurrender when there's no one left around him or goes down in a\nblaze of bullets. I gather there has been some talk about him going\ninto exile in Tunisia. That's not totally out of the question, but if he\ndoes so, that's not with the idea of giving up so much as temporarily\ntaking refuge there in order to continue on as the leader of Libya.\n\nSo I think that there's every reason to believe that what we are seeing\nis the last act, but it could be prolonged until they actually succeed in\ncapturing him. Of course part of what makes it so difficult for him to\nleave is the indictment by the International Criminal Court in the\nHague. His son Saif al-Islam is also indicted for crimes against\nhumanity. So there really is no way out for him. I think it's important\nto note that his most important audience is the mirror. And when he\nsays these things he really does believe them. It's sounds crazy, but\nit's kind of like, \"Mirror, mirror, on the wall, who's the most\nimportant Muslim Arab Third World leader of them all?\" And the\nanswer is, \"You, Muammar.\" He is really going have a very difficult\ntime seeing people celebrating his going down, in terms of trying to\nsustain that heroic inner image.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024598",
