THOMAS — VI. Police and\nV.I. Fire Service officials on St.\nCroix are investigating what they\nsay is suspected arson at the home\nof a criminal prosecutor for the V.I.\nAttomey General’s Office.\n\nThe Estate St. George home of\nAssistant Attorney General Kip\nRoberson was fully engulfed in\nflames when five Fire Service trucks\nresponded to a 911 call about 11\na.m. Thursday, according to St.\n\nCroix Fire Chief Angel Torres Sr.\nand Attorney General Vincent\nFrazer.\n\nTorres estimated that the home\nhad been buming for about 15 min-\nutes before the call came in. He said\nfirefighters had to force their way\nthrough a motorized gate to gain\naccess to the buming house. No one\nwas inside, and no one was hurt in\nthe blaze, but the home was com-\npletely destroyed, Torres said.\n\n“Tt’s a total loss,” Torres said.\n\nTorres said firefighters also found\nthat surveillance cameras at the\n\nhome had been tampered with.,\n\n“Someone cut the wires,” he said.\n“The wires was pulled out and the\nscreens were pulled out and thrown\nin the bushes.”\n\nTorres said firefighters found evi-\ndence of tampering on the doors to\nthe home, which appeared that\nsomeone had tried to pry the doors\nopen. The Fire Service did not leave\nthe scene until 3:20 p.m., Torres\nsaid.\n\nTorres said Thursday evening that\nthe Fire Service had not contacted\nany witnesses at that point and that\n\nRoberson’s home was located in an\nisolated area. He said he believed\nRoberson shared the home with\nanother attorney, but he did not\nknow the attorney’s name.\n\n“Apparently they were a couple,\nbut it’s an ongoing investigation,”\nTorres said. “We gotta really follow\nup on some leads and stuff we’re\nlooking at.”\n\nRoberson could not be reached\nfor comment Thursday evening.\n\nFrazer declined to comment about\nRoberson’s living situation. The\nattomey general said late Thursday\n\nthat he had not yet been fully briefed\n\non the fire, but he had a deputy on\n\nSt. Croix looking into the question i\nof whether the suspected arson could\n\nbe connected to any cases Roberson\n\nwas working.\n\n“Tl hope not, but we will look into\nthat,” Frazer said.\n\nTorres said the fire remains under\ninvestigation by the Police\nDepartment’s forensics unit and the\nFire Service’s arson prevention unit.\nAnyone with information about the fire\ncan call the Fire Service at 773-8050\nand ask for the arson prevention unit.\n\nElections boards’ slow vote count\n\nBy LOU MATTEI\nDaily News Staff\n\nST. THOMAS — Both Boards of Elections\nin the Virgin Islands have run afoul of the V.I.\nCode and board policies in the wake of\nTuesday’s general election, from which paper\nballots are stil] being tallied.\n\nThe V.I. Code requires the boards to count the\nvotes for each candidate within a day of receiv-\ning ballot materials from the polling places:\n“Each board of elections, after having received\nall statements, books, lists, papers, vouchers,\nballots, baliot boxes and district register from\neach polling district and polling place in its dis-\ntrict, shall convene not later than one day follow-\ning the receipt thereof and determine the total\nnumber of votes cast in the election district for\neach candidate.”\n\nThe law states that the boards must convene\nno later than three days after receiving the afore-\nmentioned materials to tally votes for the Board\nof Education and Board of Elections races.\n\nOn Tuesday, a majority of the votes from all\nraces were cast on electronic machines, and\nresults from those ballots were available within\nhours of the polls closing.\n\nHowever, widespread distrust of the machines\nled to a spike in the use of paper ballots — more\nthan 4,500\nvote count and, in effect, hampered the boards’\nabilities to comply with the law.\n\nToday marks the third day since the boards\nreceived all the ballots from the polling sites\nTuesday night.\n\nThe St. Thomas-St. John Board hopes to fin-\nish counting the Senate races by the end of the\nday today before moving on to other races,\naccording to board member Lorna Thomas.\n\nThe St. Croix Board is scheduled to begin\ncounting its 2,781 paper ballots today.\n\nThomas, who helped on Thursday to oversee\nDaily News Publishing 5!\nby Times-Shamrock & ad\nislands Daily News\n9155 Estate Thomas, Charlotte Amalie, St.\nDaily News, 9155 Estate Thomas, St.\n\nher board’s tally of about 600 ballots in the\nCompany Inc. dwned 3\nCommunications\ncon ho\ndaily, except Sunday, MUNICE\nThomas, VI 00802.

The board issued a statement\nThursday that it had finished sorting more\nthan 2,700 ballots and will begin counting\nthem today at the Election System Office in\nSunny Isle Shopping Center.\n\nSenate race, said the law makes little sense in the\ncontext of the territory’s current paper ballots,\nwhich can be counted only by hand.\n\n“Literally it would have been impossible to\nfollow,” Thomas said when asked about the law.\n“T don’t see how we could have done that.”\n\nThomas said the board should have new vot-\ning machines by the 2014 elections that can tally\npaper ballots automatically.\n\nWhen asked about enforcing the section of\nthe law cited above, V.I. Attorney General\nVincent Frazer said he “would have to look at\nthatand see.”\n\nThe boards’ handling of the paper ballots also\nhas brought them into conflict with a Board of\n\nviolates V.I. law\n\nElections policy.\n\nJoint Board of Elections Chairman Rupert\nRoss Jr. said Thursday that the joint board passed\na policy earlier this year requiring the boards to\nbegin counting any paper ballots the night of the\nelection. He said the policy never was put into\nwriting, but it may exist m some formn in minutes\nfrom the meeting. He also said the policy lacked\nan enforcement mechanism.\n\nRoss said the intent of the policy, which\npassed by a 6-5 vote, was to ensure that process-\ning of the paper ballots began as soon as possi-\nble. The sooner the counting begins, the easier it\nis to comply with another section of the law that\nrequires the boards to certify a final vote count\nwithin 10 days of an election, Ross reasoned.\n\nThe certification deadline already was weigh-\ning on the mind of Thomas, who pointed out the\nSt. Thomas-St. John Board has yet to touch\nlocked ballot boxes containing absentee ballots\nand walk-in votes.\n\nElections Supervisor John Abramson Jr. has\nsaid the district processed 412 walk-in ballots\nand mailed 331 absentee ballots.\n\nBut Thomas was optimustic that the board was\ngaining momentum after a troubled start.\n\n“Tempers were a little tight yesterday, but\neveryone’s happy today,” Thomas said. “The\npublic was much quieter and accommodating\n\ntoday, and we appreciated them teititedpgyitlkee—\n\njudges to do their jobs.”\n\nCandidate Lawrence Olive, who eamed 304\npaper-ballot votes on Thursday to bump Lisa\nWilliams from ninth place in the Senate race,\nsaid he told his supporters to use the paper bal-\nlots as a more reliable — and legal — alterna-\ntive to the electronic machines.\n\n“Tf the trend continues, I don’t see no reason\nwhy I will not be in the top seven,” Olive said.\n“Tt just goes to show you that the paper ballot is\nthe true count.”\n\n— Contact reporter Lou Mattei at 714-9124\nor email lmattei@dailynews.vi.\n\n_ St.Thomas, VI.00802\n\nElection Update\n\nSenate At-large\nCraig Barshinger\nWilma Marsh-Monsanto\n\nSt. Thomas St. John District\nClifford Graham\nShawn-Michael Malone\nMYON JACKSON seasescsceszsasececnsempecezan\nJanette Millin Young ................:..ee\nClarence Payne\nTregenza ROACH ..............sseceeeeeeeees\nDonald Cole\nJUSTIN Harrigan Sia... ceccceeeeeeeneeeees\nLawrence Olive\nLISA WiAMS .... cc cceccccceeeceseseeesteees :\nHorace Brooks\nPaul Alexander\nSean Georges\nMarvin Blyden\nLouis Willis\nAlma Francis-Heyliger\nKent Bernier Sr. ............:cccceeseceereeee 1,800\nJanelle Sarauw 1,750\nStephen Frett 1,436\nCecilia Milliner-Emanuel 1,191\nJOSEPN GUMDS.........ccecceeer eee eeeeee 1,138\nKyae CallWO6d, ccs siveariearer oe vacs ves S49\nShirley Sadler\nElvin Fahie Sr. ........ cc cccceeseeeseee rene ee 804\n\n(pale Ame\n\nCarol Berry\n\nOmodoso Muhammad\n\nCleone Marrishow\n\nJodi Hodge\n\nJosephine Lindquist\n\nAndreas Tietie. ............0.eeseseeeeeeeerenees\nOna WEDD icornttions-cxamaenawmnesneeis\nWalter Brown\n\nCharlesworth Halstead\n\n* Unofficial; as of Thursday.\n\nGk Virgin Islands Advertising Opinions Circulation\nDAILY@ NEWS Contact us St. Thomas-St. John —- 714-9138 714-9101\nSe Publisher wae baw 4-9147 News SUBSCRIPTION RATES: One dollar daily.\nA Pulitzer Prize-winning ne : < 2 e Other subscription rates available on request.\n© 2012 Daily News Publishing Co.
