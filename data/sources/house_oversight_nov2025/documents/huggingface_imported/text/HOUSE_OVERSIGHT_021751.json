  "text": "write a treatise for the judge in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade him to soften\nthe stinging language in his order.\n\nSenior U.S. District Court Judge William J. Zloch copied Acosta on his order,\nnoting, “The court is at a total loss as to why the Office of the United States Attorney\nfor the Southern District of Florida, as well as the Assistant United States Attorney\nassigned to the above-styled cause, found it appropriate to intentionally withhold ...\ninformation from the court.”\n\n<Sp_ Marie Villafana2.jpg>\n\nA. Marie Villafafia was the lead federal prosecutor in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case. The U.S. attorney’s office’s handling of\n\nthe prosecution, which led to a plea to minor charges in state court, has been harshly criticized.\n\nLater that year, Acosta and Villafafa put together a plea bargain for Epstein, a\nmultimillionaire money manager who sexually abused nearly three dozen teenage\ngirls at his mansion in Palm Beach. The deal, a federal judge ruled last month, was\nintentionally kept from his victims in violation of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.\n\nWhile the two cases are unrelated, it shows that both Acosta and Villafana had been\nwarned about the importance of victim disclosure in sex crimes cases before the\nEpstein agreement. They nevertheless forged ahead with a pact with Epstein that\nviolated the law.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Kenneth A. Marra wrote: “When the Government gives\ninformation to victims, it cannot be misleading. While the Government spent untold\nhours negotiating the terms and implications of the [agreement] with Epstein’s\nattorneys, scant information was shared with victims.”\n\nThis comes as Acosta, who is now the U.S. secretary of labor, is facing mounting\nscrutiny for his oversight of the Epstein case. On Monday, White House press\nsecretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders declined to say whether President Trump has full\nconfidence in Acosta, noting that Acosta’s involvement in the Epstein case is\n“currently under review.”\n\nThe Justice Department launched a probe in January into whether Acosta, Villafafia\nand other prosecutors committed professional misconduct.\n\nFrancey Hakes, who worked in the Justice Department’s Crimes Against Children\nunit, said Zloch’s comments were so brutal that it should have deterred Acosta and\nVillafafia from keeping the deal secret.\n\n“Tt is highly unusual for a court to allege an assistant U.S. attorney has intentionally\nwithheld information. That allegation is like dropping a bomb in the legal\ncommunity,” she said.\n\nThe story behind a Palm Beach sex offender’s remarkable deal\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021751",
