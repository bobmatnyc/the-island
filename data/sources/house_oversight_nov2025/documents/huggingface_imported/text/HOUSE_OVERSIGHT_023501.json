The opprobrium attached to\nignoring or dismissing the goal of global zero has no influence on the\nIrans and North Koreas, but it does have an influence on us. It makes\nit easy, for example, for reflexively anti-nuclear voices in the\nCongress and the Obama administration (some have migrated from\nthe former to the latter) to oppose even modest updating of our\nnuclear weapons and to make technical improvements taboo.\nThoughtful proponents of global zero should admit that this is\ndangerous nonsense.
