  "text": "54030\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nexample, they ask whether an employer\nthat occasionally uses text messaging or\nTwitter to communicate with employees\nwould have to use those technologies\nand, if so, how they would be able to\ncomply with the rule, in view of the\nlength restrictions of these media. The\nU.S. Chamber of Commerce raises the\nsame issue regarding faxing, voice mail,\nand instant messaging. The National\nRoofing Contractors Association notes\nthat some employers use email to\ncommunicate with certain employees,\nwhile other employees have no access to\nemail during their work day. As to email\ncommunication itself, an individual\nobserves that many employees change\njobs every 3 to 4 years, and an email\nreaches only those in the workforce at\n\na specific time. The same comment\nnotes that the proposed rule does not\nstate when or how often email notice\nshould be provided. Three Georgetown\nlaw students recommend that the rule\nmandate email as well as intranet notice\nto employees when it goes into effect\nand written notice to new employees\nwithin a week of their starting\nemployment.\n\nThe Board responds that, as discussed\nabove regarding the location of posting,\n“customarily” is used in its normal\nmeaning. This provision of the rule\nwould not apply to an employer that\nonly occasionally uses electronic means\nto communicate with employees.\nHowever, in view of the numerous\ncomments expressing concern over the\nproposed rule’s email posting\nrequirements, the Board has decided not\nto require employers to provide the\nnotice to employees by means of email\nand the other forms of electronic\ncommunication listed in the previous\nparagraph. In the Board’s judgment, the\npotential for confusion and the prospect\nof requiring repeated notifications in\norder to reach new employees outweigh\nthe benefits that could be derived at the\nmargin from such notifications. All\nemployers subject to the rule will be\nrequired to post the notice physically in\ntheir facilities; and employers who\ncustomarily post notices to employees\nregarding personnel rules or policies on\nan internet or intranet site will be\nrequired to post the Board’s notice on\nthose sites as well. Moreover, those\nnotices (unlike the Board’s election and\nremedial notices) must remain posted;\nthus, it is reasonable to expect that even\nthough some employees may not see the\nnotices immediately, more and more\nwill see them and learn about their\nNLRA rights as time goes by.\nAccordingly, the only electronic\n\nMount Sterling, Kentucky Chamber of Commerce;\nU.S. Xpress, Inc.\n\npostings required under the final rule\nwill be those on internet or intranet\nsites.\n\nMany comments address the\ncharacteristics of electronic posting, as\nprescribed in § 104.202(f). In the NPRM,\nthe Board proposed not to prescribe the\nsize, clarity, location, or brightness of an\nelectronic notice or link to the notice,\nbut rather require that it be at least as\nprominent as other electronic notices to\nemployees, as the Department of Labor’s\nrule requires. No comments suggest\nmore specific requirements; the\nMichigan Health & Hospital Association\nargues that such requirements would\nresult in inadvertent noncompliance.\nThe Board has decided to adopt the\nDepartment of Labor’s approach, as\nproposed in the NPRM.\n\nBaker & McKenzie urges that the title\nof the link in the proposed rule be\nchanged to ‘Employee Rights under the\nNational Labor Relations Act” rather\nthan “Important Notice about\nEmployees Rights to Organize and\nBargain Collectively with Their\nEmployers.’ The Board agrees and has\nrevised the rule accordingly.\n\nA comment from Vigilant states that\na link to the Board’s Web site, which is\none means of electronic posting, should\nnot be required to include the\nintroductory language of the notice. The\nBoard agrees, noting that the\nDepartment of Labor takes this\napproach, and will not require that\nelectronic links to the Board’s Web site\ninclude the introductory language.\n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Board\nhas decided to retain the posting\nrequirements as proposed in the NPRM,\nmodified as indicated above.\n\ne. Compliance With the Department of\nLabor’s Rule\n\nSeveral comments opposing the\nproposed rule urge that, if the rule\nbecomes final, the Board should retain\nthe “safe harbor’ provided for Federal\ncontractors that comply with the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice posting\nrule.134 However, the U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce states that some employers\npost the Department of Labor’s notice at\nfacilities where it is not required or\nwhere Federal contract work is\nperformed only sporadically. It\nquestions whether such employers must\nreplace the Department of Labor’s notice\nwith the Board’s when no contract work\nis being performed, or whether they can\ncomply with the Board’s rule by leaving\nthe Department of Labor’s notice in\nplace. The Chamber proposes that\n\n134 See, e.g., comments of IFDA; Estes; The Sack\nCompany; National Roofing Contractors\nAssociation.\n\nemployers be allowed to choose to\nmaintain the Department of Labor’s\nnotice, although another comment\nasserts that employees might think that\nthe notice is no longer applicable\nbecause of the lack of a current contract.\nAnother comment raises the possibility\nthat either the Board or the Department\nof Labor could decide to change its\nnotice and emphasized that they need to\nbe identical in order to provide the safe\nharbor. The Board responds that a\nFederal contractor that complies with\nthe Department of Labor’s notice-\nposting rule will be deemed in\ncompliance with the Board’s\nrequirement.135\n\n3. Exceptions\n\nThe rule applies only to employers\nthat are subject to the NLRA. Under\nNLRA Section 2(2), “employer”\nexcludes the United States government,\nany wholly owned government\ncorporation, any Federal Reserve Bank,\nany State or political subdivision, and\nany person subject to the Railway Labor\nAct, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seg. 29 U.S.C.\n152(2). Thus, under the proposed rule,\nthose excluded entities are not required\nto post the notice of employee rights.\nThe proposed rule also does not apply\nto entities that employ only individuals\nwho are not considered “employees”’\nunder the NLRA. See Subpart A, below;\n29 U.S.C. 152(3). Finally, the proposed\nrule does not apply to entities over\nwhich the Board has been found not to\nhave jurisdiction, or over which the\nBoard has chosen through regulation or\nadjudication not to assert\njurisdiction.13® The Board proposed that\nall employers covered under the NLRA\nwould be subject to the notice posting\ntule. 75 FR 80413.\n\nThe Coalition for a Democratic\nWorkplace argues that the final rule\ncannot be applied to religiously-\naffiliated employers. The Coalition\nargues that assertion of jurisdiction\nwould “substantially burden [such\nemployers’] exercise of religion in\nviolation of both the First Amendment\nand the Religious Freedom Restoration\nAct.” Similarly, Seyfarth Shaw contends\nthat religiously-affiliated healthcare\n\n135 A few comments ask whether the Board’s rule\nwould preempt the Department of Labor’s rule.\nBecause the answer to that question would not\naffect the validity of the Board’s rule, the Board\nfinds it unnecessary to take a position on that issue\nin this proceeding.\n\n136 The proposed rule excludes small businesses\nwhose impact on interstate commerce is de minimis\nor so slight that they do not meet the Board’s\ndiscretionary jurisdiction requirements.
