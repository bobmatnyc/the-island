  "text": "\"T think Qatar is going by the ground\nreality,\" says Bokhari. \"Fatah, the ruling\nfaction of the PA, is essentially tanking. It's\nreally in a state of decline because of\ncorruption and charges of embezzlement.\nIt's got an aging leadership. There's no\ndynamism left in the group. There's a lot of\nfactionalism. It's almost like an oligarchy.\"\n\nRawabi could be Qatar's way of\nencouraging the currently-calm status quo\nin the West Bank, but without obviously\nupgrading their ties to Israel, or throwing\ntheir money behind a political\nestablishment that they don't fully trust.\n\"On one end they need to make sure Fatah\ndoes not completely collapse or weaken to\nthe point where they're no longer coherent,\"\nsays Bokhari, \"and Hamas needs to be\nshaped and contained and shepherded in a\nway that it doesn't grow into anything\nlarger.\"\n\nThough there are politics underlying\nQatar's investment in Rawabi, it is still,\ninevitably, a financial decision. \"You have\nserious people who have a lot at risk here,\"\nDanin says. \"Their goal is not primarily to\nmake a political point. Their goal is to\nrecoup their investment and make some\nmoney.\" Even resource-rich Qatar, which\nwants to diversity its holdings in order to\nhedge against long-term shifts in the oil\nand natural gas market, cares whether its\ninvestment choices pay off.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025089",
