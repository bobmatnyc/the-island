The topic of my speech was the Middle East conflict. I was\nintroduced to Sassoon by David Steinberg, the comedian. Steinberg said, “Did you know that\nVidal Sassoon had fought for Israel during its War of Independence?” Sassoon added, “I was in\nthe Palmach,” which was the elite strike force. Sassoon simply didn’t look like he was old enough\nto have participated in the 1948 war so I issued him a challenge, “Sing the Palmach song for me.”\nWithout a moment’s hesitation, Vidal Sassoon started to belt out the anthem of the Palmach.\nSince I too knew the song, from my time at Zionist camp in 1948, I sang along with him. So here\nwere these two old men singing “Mi mitula ad hanegev, rishonim tamud anachau tamid anu anu\nhapalmach.” A crowd quickly gathered around us and the few people our own age joined in the\nsinging. It was a wonderfully nostalgic moment for us all.\n\n387\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017474",
