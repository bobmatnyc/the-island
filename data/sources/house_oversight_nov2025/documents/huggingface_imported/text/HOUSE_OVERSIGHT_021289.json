Similarly, individuals\nwith fewer social connections (i.e., a\nsmaller social network) were less likely\nto be physically active, but the effects of\nloneliness on physical activity did not\ndepend on the size of the social network.\nThe invisible force of loneliness seems\nto play a unique role in this particular\npredisease pathway.\n\nAnother commonly cited risk\nfactor for disease is stress. In reality,\n“stress” refers to a family of predisease\npathways, each of which may be\nvulnerable to the influence of lonely\nfeelings. Loneliness is itself a source of\nstress, but lonely individuals also differ\nin their exposure to stressful events and\ncircumstances. This is less evident in\nyoung adults than it is in older adults in\nwhom loneliness was associated with\nhaving experienced a greater number of\nstressful life events in the past year (e.g.,\ndeath in the family, marital crisis,\nchange in employment status) and more\nsources of chronic stress (e.g.,\nemployment stress, marital stress).° In\naddition, lonely individuals perceive life\nas more stressful and less gratifying than\ntheir socially connected counterparts,\neven when objective indications are that\nlonely and nonlonely individuals do not\ndiffer in the types of activities and\nbehaviors they engage in on a daily\nbasis. Good quality social interactions\ntypically ameliorate feelings of stress,\nbut because lonely people perceive their\ninteractions to be less positive than those\nof nonlonely people, they fail to derive\nthe same benefit. Good coping strategies\ncan also ameliorate feelings of stress, but\nlonely individuals are more likely to\nrespond to stress with pessimism and\navoidance than with optimism and active\n\nPage |43\n\nengagement. And to add insult to injury,\nloneliness increases sensitivity to and\nsurveillance for social threats. Anxiety,\nlow self-esteem, and fear of negative\nevaluation elicit self-defensive behaviors\nand effectively tax cognitive resources\nthat would normally be available to meet\nthe demands of daily life stress. Thus,\nwhat might naively be thought of as a\ncircumscribed problem—the feeling of\nloneliness and isolation—may be seen\nby the sufferer as a world of inescapable\nthreat.’\n\nHow might these cognitions and\nperceptions influence physiology and\nhealth? As Berntson shows in his\nchapter, the brain regions involved in\nemotional and perceptual processes are\nintimately related to brain regions\ninvolved in the regulation of\nphysiological systems. This is\nparticularly evident in alterations of the\nfunctioning of the cardiovascular system\nin lonely individuals. In young adults,\nthis alteration is apparent in increased\nresistance to blood flow in small arteries\nthroughout the body. Increased vascular\nresistance is a precursor and\npredominant contributor to age-related\nincreases in systolic blood pressure\n(SBP), a major risk factor for\ncardiovascular disease. In middle-aged\nadults, SBP is significantly higher in\nlonely adults than in their nonlonely\ncounterparts. Moreover, loneliness\naccelerates the rate of increases in SBP,*\nindicating a faster decline in\nphysiological resilience and a heightened\nrisk for chronic cardiovascular disease.\nIt’s as though loneliness accelerates the\naging process.\n\nBy virtue of extensive\ninterconnections among the brain,\nperipheral nervous systems, and\nendocrine glands, the feelings of\nisolation and loneliness have a broad and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021289",
