  "text": "There’s yet another level, and probably one day it will have a more interesting\nname. With knowledge-based programming, we have a way of creating an actual\nrepresentation of real things in the world, in a precise and symbolic way. Not only is it\nunderstandable by brains and communicable to other brains and to computers, it’s also\nimmediately executable.\n\nJust as natural language gave us civilization, knowledge-based programming will\ngive us—what? One bad answer is that it will give us the civilization of the Als. That’s\nwhat we don’t want to happen, because the Als will do a great job communicating with\none another and we’ll be left out of it, because there’s no intermediate language, no\ninterface with our brains. What will this fourth level of knowledge communication lead\nto? If you were Caveman Ogg and you were just realizing that language was starting,\ncould you imagine the coming of civilization? What should we be imagining right now?\n\nThis relates to the question of what the world would look like if most people\ncould code. Clearly, many trivial things would change: Contracts would be written in\ncode, restaurant recipes might be written in code, and so on. Simple things like that\nwould change. But much more profound things would also change. The rise of literacy\ngave us bureaucracy, for example, which had already existed but dramatically\naccelerated, giving us a greater depth of governmental systems, for better or worse. How\ndoes the coding world relate to the cultural world?\n\nTake high school education. If we have computational thinking, how does that\naffect how we study history? How does that affect how we study languages, social\nstudies, and so on? The answer is, it has a great effect. Imagine you’re writing an essay.\nToday, the raw material for a typical high school student’s essay is something that’s\nalready been written; students usually can’t generate new knowledge easily. But in the\ncomputational world, that will no longer be true. If the students know something about\nwriting code, they’ll access all that digitized historical data and figure out something\nnew. Then they’ll write an essay about something they’ve discovered. The achievement\nof knowledge-based programming is that it’s no longer sterile, because it’s got the\nknowledge of the world knitted into the language you’ re using to write code.\n\nThere’s computation all over the universe: in a turbulent fluid producing some\ncomplicated pattern of flow, in the celestial mechanics of planetary interactions, in\nbrains. But does computation have a purpose? You can ask that about any system. Does\nthe weather have a goal? Does climate have a goal?\n\nCan someone looking at Earth from space tell that there’s anything with a purpose\nthere? Is there a civilization there? In the Great Salt Lake, in Utah, there’s a straight\nline. It turns out to be a causeway dividing two areas of the lake with different colors of\nalgae, so it’s a very dramatic straight line. There’s a road in Australia that’s long and\nstraight. There’s a railroad in Siberia that’s long, and lights go on when a train stops at\nthe stations. So from space you can see straight lines and patterns.\n\nBut are these clear enough examples of obvious purpose on Earth as viewed from\nspace? For that matter, how do we recognize extraterrestrials out there? How do we tell\nif a signal we’re getting indicates purpose? Pulsars were discovered in 1967, when we\npicked up a periodic flutter every second or so. The first question was, Is this a beacon?\n\n190\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016993",
