Unbelievable. These guys just love the publicity - clinton, dershowitz, now Trump. First these\n\"friends\" act like anything but your friend once they get sued; then the next joker of a lawyer decides to join this\ncottage industry of suing you and hoping either you settle or the \"friend\" settles.\n\nSorry to see this. Good luck.\nDavid\n\nSent from AOL Mobile Mail\nGet the new AOL app: mail.mobile.aol.com\n\njeevacation@gmail.com\n\nthx\n\nOn Wed, Jul 6, 2016 at 9:28 PM, <> wrote:\n\nJust read the Fox News piece today rehashing old stories. The media just cannot let go and loves to think of\nnew angles to get you in headlines. Sorry to see it; but 1am sure by now you can deal with it for what it is.\n\nI appreciate the call from Darren a few weeks ago and would have loved to have a fought a battle for the fellow\nat issue. But once he let me know the guy had been served and it was just a matter if defending a deposition, 1\nsuggested that it might be a waste of money to have me handle that. I hope it worked out. I am more than\nhappy to get involved any time in any way i can help - and i would like to think i could help with what i bring\nto the table. I just did not feel in that circumstance that you did not need me adding to the milking of resources\nthat i am sure has been going on with lawyers for years.\n\nI would have felt differently if it were a matter if taking depositions or actually litigating a case. I would like\nto think that in that circumstance i could add value. If we ever meet, i will tell you a bit about depositions i\ntook not long ago of the leaders of the PFLP terrorist organization. That was my kind of setting.\n\nPlease know that i am here to help in any way i can with any case or just for advice if you think my help would\nbe meaningful. Your situation seems to me to raise the combination of friends you have been very good to\nusing all you gave them and then ditching you and sharks swarming when they smell blood and i don't like to\nsee either.\n\nI \"met\" you originally through a friend 1 like very much. I wish it had been earlier in time; but looking to the\npresent and future, you just let me know if you need me.\n\nTake care.\nDavid\n\nSent from AOL Mobile Mail\nGet the new AOL app: mail.mobile.aol.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031492",
