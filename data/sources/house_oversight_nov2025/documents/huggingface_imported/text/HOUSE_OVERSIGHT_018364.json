  "text": "the endless long continuum. We do think in too short a time frame. But the clock\nalso, I began to suspect as I considered it, had another role. Those 10,000 years of\nmarked time were an attempt to scratch an itch bothering these pioneers of\ncyberspace. It might even have been a sort of guilty sensation. After all, there was\nsomething that they had demolished in their ceaseless fast connecting of the world -\nmaybe accidentally, but anyhow it could never be put back to where it was. If the\ngreat industrial titans before them had, over several hundred years, vanquished\ndistance, lacing the world with trading networks, the men and women behind the\nclock were fracturing something else, something that for all of human history had\nseemed the only reliable, safe, sad constant of our condition: Time. For most of\nhistory, time and space were seen as facts, immutable forces that could not be\novercome or adjusted or fought. Time particularly. The quintessential, tragically\nnon-negotiable condition of life. The backers of the clock were, in their “day jobs”, in\nthe business of overcoming, adjusting, fighting and even destroying an older sense\nof time. What might once have taken years, they were committed to making happen\nin an instant.\n\nThe Long Now project, then, was like one of those carefully isolated arctic freezers,\nwhere samples of essential grains and DNA from Beethoven’s hair and Einstein’s\nbrain are sunk and iced against the godforbid day in which our basic feedstock or a\nchunk of humanity has been wiped out by accident or disaster. Blasted into a\nmountain hole, designed to last thousands of years, the clock is a repository for time\nitself. Itis a defensive museum, built against the moment when instant networks\nfinally devour the off switch and kill an older, essential feeling of time. The clock-\nmakers knew, | think, that they had helped to demolish a particular sense of pace\nwith their fast, instant networks. They wanted, with the knowledgeable keening of\nthe guilty, a new device, one carefully gated away from the very revolution they\nwere encouraging with their business and technical obsessions. This hunger for\nspeed had built their fortunes. Their revolution (and its IPOs) had paid for the clock,\nfrankly. And the hope for “instant world” had inspired their dreams long before\ndeep, fast connections were possible. Bezos’s first name for Amazon, Cadabara,\ncaptured just this sense of waving wands and the eye-blink “Now you don't see it,\nnow you do!” appearance of just what you want or need. Murdering time. You could\nask: What are the really networks for anyway? Would they feel guilty when they\nconfessed?\n\n2.\n\nDanny Hillis’s father was an epidemiologist. His mother was a bio-statistician. And\nhis childhood was a blur of infection-led family migrations. “Anywhere in the world\nthere was an epidemic, we would go,” he recalled. As the family bounced from Dehli\nto Cairo to Dakha to Nairobi, racing diseases one after another, Danny developed a\nvivid, energetic autodidactisism. He would collect knowledge from his parents, from\nthe streets around him, his new friends, anywhere. In a library in Calcutta, for\ninstance, he once found a copy of George Boole’s 1854 book “An Investigation Into\nthe Laws of Thought”. Boole invented symbolic logic on those pages and though his\ninstincts were grounded in an age of steam and machines, his vision still echoes in\n\n132\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018364",
