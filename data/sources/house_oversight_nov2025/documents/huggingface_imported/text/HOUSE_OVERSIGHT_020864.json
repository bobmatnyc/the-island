  "text": "The Original Estimates of Medicare’s Costs\n\nWere Vastly Underestimated\n\n* In 1965, the official estimate of Medicare’s costs was $500 million per year,\nroughly $3 billion in 2005 dollars.*\n\n* The actual cost of Medicare has turned out to be 10x that estimate.\n\n- Medicare’s actual net loss (tax receipts + trust fund interest — expenditures)\nhas exceeded $3 billion (adjusted for inflation) every year since 1976 and\nwas $146 billion in 2008 alone. In other words, had the original estimate been\naccurate, the cumulative 43-year cost since Medicare was created would\nhave been $129 billion, adjusted for inflation.\n\n- In fact, the actual cumulative spending has been $1.4 trillion** (adjusted for\ninflation)...in effect, 10x over budget.\n\n* While calculations have been flawed from the beginning for some of USA Inc.’s\nentitlement programs, little has been done to correct the problems.\n\nAn accurate economic forecast might have sunk Medicare.\nDavid Blumenthal and James Morone\n\n“The Lessons of Success — Revisiting the Medicare Story”, November 2008\n\nSources: * Lyndon B.
