It was really interesting,”\nEgil Asprem\nAssociate Professor in the History of Religions at Stockholm University.\n“It is exciting to see text moving toward production - and quite an impressive job by the editors\nin cutting the text so much while retaining the essentials in an elegant way!”\n“It's been a pleasure working with you!”\nPamela Asquith\nProfessor of Anthropology, University of Alberta.\n“The journal looks very interesting indeed and I feel it is an honor to be invited to contribute.”\nJeremy Avigad\nProfessor of Philosophy at Carnegie Mellon University.\n“I have been reading and enjoying a number of articles in Inference. I am impressed; it is a very\nnice publication.”\nJeremy Bersntein\nProfessor emeritus of physics at the Stevens Institute of Technology.\n“So many thanks. This worked out very well. The editing was excellent although the caricature of\nme looked more like Donald Trump than me! I hope to work with you in the future”\n“I read the issue with great interest and was pleased to see my quantum there.”\n“I thank the editors for their good editing. ”\n1\nInference: International Review of Science\nFeedback & Comments\nRobert Berwick\nProfessor of Computational Linguistics and Computer Science and Engineering at MIT.\n“I am truly delighted that you and others have started publishing such a journal as Inference,\nwhich touches on so many of my own concerns and interests - I have been meaning for years to\nwrite articles on evolutionary theory (some like the fine ones you’ve already published); on big\ndata and its discontents (I have one on the deep troubles with deep learning); on the sloppy\nconnectome neuroscience (which you’ve covered); and so on - in fact, many of the topics on your\n“hit list”. Your abbreviations alone are priceless.”\nSimon Blackburn\nProfessor of Philosophy at the University of Cambridge.\n“Many thanks for the new issue link and for the prompt payment. Unusual in the publishing\nworld.”\n“Fascinating. I had not realised how high you aimed.”\nRalph Blumenthal\nFormer reporter for The New York Times.\n“Thanks, looks impressive.

I think it came out\nnicely.”\nAlexander Bogomolny\nCut The Knot blog.\n“I loved the journal - very broadly informative. I plan to making references to a few articles.”\n2\nInference: International Review of Science\nFeedback & Comments\nWilliam Briggs\nIndependent writer, statistician, scientist and consultant.\n“It would be my honor to accept your invitation. I know your journal. I especially like George\nEllis's latest essay.”\nJohn Brooke\nProfessor of History and Anthropology and Director of the Center for Historical Research at Ohio\nState.\n“Many thanks – I have been spending the last few minutes reading these letters, you have put\ntogether an excellent body of commentary.”\nUmberto Cannella\nPhysicist and currently educational specialist for the Swiss Space Center at the Polytechnic\nFederal Institute in Lausanne.\n“I very much enjoyed the final form of the essay: the editing has really improved its completeness\nand readibility. The caricature was a nice plus of the collaboration: it was a pleasure to work\nwith Inference and I do hope to contribute again in the future.”\nJames Carny\nBrunel University London.\n“I read Inference with great interest, and consider it to be one of the most useful publications for\nintelligent and challenging writing across all the disciplines.”\nGregory Chaitin\nProfessor at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro.\n“I enjoyed very much the pieces by David Berlinski and Kusala Rajendran.

I liked them all. You all, the editors,\nhave worked very hard, I see, at getting the papers in a readable but not a condescending\nshape.”\nJohn Colarusso\nComparative linguist at McMaster University.\n“It is an extraordinary journal. Fascinating!”\n“I am so pleased to have had a chance to contribute to it.”\n4\nInference: International Review of Science\nFeedback & Comments\nSimon Conway Morris\nEnglish palaeontologist, evolutionary biologist, and astrobiologist.\n“Thank you for your e-mail as well as sending me earlier a recent copy of Inference.

It is a very nice format, and gives a great opportunity for a deeper discussion of\nscientific issues like this one.”\n“I received a copy of Inference. I have been impressed by the work that I have seen published by\nother researchers in Inference.”\nWilliam von Hippel\nProfessor and former head of the School of Psychology at the University of Queensland.\n“Thanks, looks very interesting!”\nRoald Hoffmann \nNobel Prize in Chemistry.\n“I really enjoyed your article in Inference, because you really tried to convey to a general\neducated audience what a synthesis is like.

It has splendid articles\nand may the publication prosper.”\nMatthew Kleban\nAssociate Professor of Physics and Director of the Center for Cosmology and Particle Physics at\nNew York University.\n“It seems to me that Ellis’ criticism of my response is rather dishonest. He quotes part of a\nparagraph, and then attacks it (“Wrong…”) on precisely the grounds that I addressed in the\nsentences following the part he quoted, which he ignores. Nevertheless, I’m glad to see this\ndebate playing out in a serious publication (rather than on blogs etc).”\nLawrence Krauss\nFoundation Professor of the School of Earth and Space Exploration at Arizona State University\nand director of its Origins Project.\n“ It is a remarkable collection.

I feel truly honored. And many thanks for the\ngenerous remuneration as well.”\nDavid LePoire\nEnvironmental analyst at the US national laboratory.\n“Thank you very much. Your efforts in revising and editing this paper have improved it greatly.\nAlthough I like the figure, I realize that the table is more readable.”\nJohn Leslie\nUniversity Professor Emeritus, Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada.\n“I am grateful for the issues of Inference that you have sent to me, all of them very interesting.\nI admired its quality.”\nAudrey Li\nProfessor of East Asian Languages and Cultures and Linguistics.\n“Many thanks for bringing my attention to this excellent article. The writing is accessible and\ncaptivating. Hope you don't mind me helping to spread words about this article.”\nStuart Lindsay\nDirector of the Center for Single Molecule Biophysics in the Biodesign Institute, Arizona State\nUniversity.\n“The many requests from “vanity” publishers swamp out the genuine article. Your publication is\nvery interesting.

Congratulations—a great issue!”\n“An aside, if I may: I happen to writing some teaching materials on time travel universes and\nquantum mechanics for my online teaching book. So it was a welcome surprise to find articles on\nthe very topic in Vol 3 and Vol 4 of your journal. Count me as a happy reader!”\nChristof Paulus\nVisiting lecturer in the Department of History at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\n“It really has become a very interesting new issue of Inference.

I do think it is unique - both in its style and\ncoverage, and in its readership who I imagine are intellectuals in the broadest sense. It should be\na privilege to write for it”\n“I am very impressed by the depth and quality of the contributions. There are critical literary\njournals (e.g. the London Review of Books) but I have not come across anything like this in the\nsciences.”\nEric Scerri\nHistorian and philosopher of chemistry in the Department of Chemistry & Biochemistry at\nUCLA.\n“What an excellent journal!”\nPierre Schapira\nProfessor Emeritus at University Pierre et Marie Curie, Paris 6.\n“This issue seems extremely rich and interesting.”\n13\nInference: International Review of Science\nFeedback & Comments\nGeorge Scialabba\nContributing editor of the online art and literary magazine The Baffler.\n“I look forward to reading it, as usual.”\nJames Sharpe\nProfessor of Early Modern History.\n“Again, my thanks for having been sent this, and I would like to extend my best wishes for the\nfuture of Inference.”\nLawrence R.

Wilson\nEntrepreneur and artificial intelligence researcher.\n“I hadn't previously heard of your magazine, but when I clicked over to your website my eye was\nimmediately caught by Gregory Chaitin's article, as he is one of my favorite mathematicians. I\nalso read with great pleasure \"Categories: From Zero to Infinity\" by Pierre Schapira, which did\nan excellent job of communicating a highly technical subject. I'm now looking forward to\nperusing the rest of the site when I have time!”\nNatalie Wolchover\nAward-winning science writer, she has covered the physics beat on staff at Quanta Magazine\nsince the magazine's launch in 2013.\n“Thank you very much for the invitation to write for your excellent journal.
