The\ninternational media, no surprise,\nfocus on the constitutional\namendment ending term limits,\nassuming President XiJinping will\nnow serve in a for-life dictator-\nship, reminiscent of Mao's China,\nthe Soviet Union, the Kim family\nin North Korea and some African\ncountries.\n\nIt is no challenge to explain\nwhy abolishing term limits is bad\nfor China - dependency on one\nhuman being who is not omni-\nscient but is hostage to fortune,\nfewer and weaker checks and\nbalances, forced conformity in a\ncomplex society with no easy an-\nswers, etc. The system begins\nstronger in that hard choices can\nbe made and consistency main-\ntained, butit could become brittle\nin that officials are more wary and\nmay say things they do not\nbelieve.\n\nItisa challenge to explain why\nabolishing term limits is good for\nChina, so that's what! will do.\n\nFirst, some background. There\nare three separate issues being\nconflated: the significance of end-\ning term limits, the intended con-\nsequences and the unintended\nconsequences. Though terminat-\ning the two-term limit for China's\npresidency captures headlines, it\nis more the symbolic, final step\nratifying Xi’s near-absolute power\nthan the big breakthrough itself.\n\nMany expect this\nexperiment to\nend badly for\nChina. It is\nindeed an\nexperiment but\nits end is not set\n\nXi’s prior designation as “core” of\nthe Communist Party in October\n2016 and the inscribing of “Xi\nJinping Thought...” into the party\nconstitution in October 2017 were\nmore meaningful.\n\nMoreover, the Politburo\nStanding Committee, the highest\nauthoritative body in China,\nunambiguously supports Xi.\nChina watchers see the front page\nof People's Daily - published the\nday after the new Standing Com-\nmittee marched out on stage —\nwhich featured Xi’s photo on top,\nmany times larger than the small-\ner, subservient photo of all seven\nmembers lined up on the bottom.\n\nAll this reconfirms that, in a\nsystem where the party controls\nthe state - especially where the\npany ‘is Marxist and ideology is its\n\nasis for being — Xi, as core of the\nparty, with his name inscribed in\nthe constitutions of party and\nstate as the contemporary arbiter\nof Marxism, will be the uncontest-\ned, overarching leader of China\nfor the rest of his sentient life.\n\nFor intended consequences,\nthe official line is that the purpose\nis national cohesion brought\nabout when the three top leader-\nship positions — general secretary\nofthe party, chairman of the Cen-\ntral Military Commission and\npresident of the republic - are\naligned temporally and held bya\nsingle person.\n\nhis makes sense, but as a\nprimary, proximal motivation, itis\nnot entirely persuasive. The\ncurrent structure has existed for\ndecades without outcry or angst\n(notto mention that the three po-\nsitions could be unified by install-\ning term limits on the other two).\n\nThe “newera”, marked by eco-\nnomic, social and global com-\nplexities, is said to require firm\nand consistent leadership, mak-\ning moot inner party struggles\nand even mitigating political gos-\nsip, facilitating focus on the tasks\nof governance and development.\nSpecifically, because advancing\n\netd)\n\nreformhasbecome more difficult,\nwith entrenched interest groups\nresisting change, the message\nmust now go forth that all must\nget with the programme, because\nyou can’t outwit or outwait Xi.\n\nBecause, it is said that only Xi\nhas the vision, experience, com-\npetence and character to bring\nabout “the great rejuvenation of\nthe Chinese people”, especially\nfrom 2020 to 2035 and ultimately\nto 2050- bringing China to global\ncentre stage — Xi’s unimpeded\nleadership is deemed essential.\nChina cannot afford “downtime”\nto accommodate a change of\nleadership, and after Xi’s success\nat the 19th National Party Con-\ngress came the time to make clear\nthat he will call the shots for the\nforeseeable future.\n\nSome argue that doing away\nwith term limits shows the superi-\nority of the Chinese system as it\nallows flexibility in matching\nleadership to requirements\n(though what national leader,\nwhen extending his reach, hasnot\nclaimed “current requirements”\nas justification?)\n\nThe party-run Global Times\nstated that ending term limits\ndoes notmean China has reverted\nto president-for-life tenure. (But\nwho can deny that however long\nXi holds the top positions seems\nlargely up to him?)\n\nAs for the unintended conse-\nquences, the almost unanimous,\ndisparaging foreign reaction —\nother than US President Donald\nTrump’s-didnotburnish China's\ninternational image.\n\nMore worrisome would be a\nreluctance by officials to offer\nconstructive opposing views on\ncentral policies.\n\nBy stressing term limits, the\ninternational media misses\nfundamental changes going on in\nChina ~ this ee, innovation,\nstreamlining of government, faci-\nlitation of business (cutting\nbureaucracy and reducing taxes),\nrural revitalisation and rural land\n\nreform. The 13th National Peo-\nple’s Congress shows how the\ngrand vision and mission of the\n19th National Party Congress is\ntranslated into specific strategies\nand policies. Ifone sees only term\nlimits, one cannotvisualise thebig\npicture.\n\nAsforXimaintaining the presi-\ndency perpetually, it doesn’tactu-\nally matter much thisis the deep\ninsight of how China’s party-state\nsystem works. Xi as core of the\nparty and “Xi Jinping Thought...”\nas the party's (andnowthestate’s)\nguiding principle means that Xi\ncan transfer titular party leader-\nshipand/orthe presidencyto oth-\ners and still maintain his\noverarching power. It may well be\nthat, after serving two or even\nthree more terms, rather than try-\ning to find and install another\nleaderlike himself, he will move to\nbring about true democracy with-\ninthe I.\n\nHere's he best case. Xi will not\nbe leader-for-life, but leader long\nenough to bring about China's\nnational rejuvenation and estab-\nlish a Chinese kind of democratic\nnorms. Could Xi continue until\naround 2035, when China plans to\nhave “basically” achieved full mo-\ndernisation, heading towards, by\nmid-century, 2050, a “great mod-\nern socialist country”?\n\nMany expect this experiment\ntoend badly for China. Itis indeed\nan experiment but its end is not\nset. It may be a race between\nachieving Xi’s grand vision and\nsome untoward perturbation that\ncould cause fracture.\n\nAllfactors considered, Iam not\nsaying abolishing term limits is\nabsolutely good for China. I am\nsaying itmay be good -because of\nChina's special conditions and\nXi’s special capabilities—butifitis\ngood, it’s just for this once, andit’s\njust for so long. That's the best\ncase. I'm rooting forXi.\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhnisa public\nintellectual, international corporate\nstrategist and investment banker, and\nChina expert/commentator. He is the\nauthor of How China’s Leaders Think\n\nWhat the Western belt and road sceptics are missing\n\nWenshan Jia says there are opportunities for the whole world to benefit from China’s initiative\n\nhina'’s “Belt and Road Initiative’is\n\nan original plan to carry out anew\n\ntype of “collaborative globalisation”\nabove and beyond US-led type. Itwas\nproposed five years ago by President Xi\nJinping after the tapering off of US-led\nglobalisation in 2008.\n\nXioffered three principles: mutual\nconsultation, joint construction and\nshared benefits. China has since then fully\nexecuted 101 agreements with 86\ncountries, and total investmentin the 24\ncountries along the belt and road regions.\nhas amounted to US$50 billion, resulting\nin 75 industrial and trade zones, an¢\n200,000 jobs.\n\nWith its focus on infrastructure, the\ninitiative is a model not only for developing\ncountries, but also industrialised ones in\nEurope and North America, where ageing\ninfrastructure needs replacing. It also\nadapts to each local, national or regional\ncondition, situation and need. Itis proving\nvery democratic, more so than the\nlopsided US-led globalisation that spurred\na populist, isolationist backlash across the\nWestern world.\n\nChina has done a proper job of\nexplaining to the West what the initiative is\nand extended a sincere invitation to each\n\ncountry to join. Many think tank scholars.\nand major media outlets in the West have\nfound it potentially lucrative and\nexpressed relatively strong support.\n\nYet, instead of appreciating China's\nefforts to both inherit the liberal agenda of\nglobalisation and forgea new path for\nglobal development, many Western\npolitical elite, led by the US, have started a\ncampaign to resist the initiative. From\nAustralia to the US, and the UK to\nGermany, there are calls for the West to cut\ninteractions with China to minimise or\nresist its so-called “sharp power”. The\nlabels typically applied to China include\n“authoritarian” and ‘predatory citing\nBeijing for not upholding “freedom,\ndemocracy and individual rights”, the core\nvalues of the West.\n\nThis attitude towards the initiative\nreveals not only a contradiction in the\nWestern mind, but also the narrowing or\neven closing of minds.\n\nIsn'tit beneficial to meet the goals of\nforging connectivity and cooperation, as\narticulated in Xi’s effort to enrich and\nexpand the meaning of the “free world” by\nliberating humankind from geographical,\nfinancial, political and cultural barriers?\nThe worldis no longer the West versus the\n\nrest, as wealready live in aworld\nconnected by the internet. The initiative\nseeks to make the world more\ninterconnected for both the West and the\nrest, contributing to the construction ofa\nhuman community with a shared future.\n\nRecently, the initiative has inspired and\nspawned a push for localisation,\nparticularly the Indo-Pacific strategy led by\nthe so-called “Quad” of the US, India,\nJapan and Australia. Some Western media\nviewit asa rival or alternative to China’s\nbeltand road.\n\nBut] would argue that it can be part of\nChina's initiative as longas the three\nChinese principles (mutual consultation,\n\nThe anti-China smear\ncampaign must be\nreplaced bya\ndiscourse involving\nconsultation and\ncommunication\n\njoint construction and shared benefits) are\nobserved in the Quad strategy. The belt\nand road was created to be anall-inclusive\nplatform, so Beijing has no need to fear\nlocalisation as long as such strategies do\nnot seek to contain China or disruptits\nplan. Itwould be wise for the Quad and\nChina to look for ways to collaborate.\n\nQuad countries need not take an\nantagonistic stance towards China; the\nanti-China smear campaign must be\nreplaced bya discourse involving\nconsultation and communication. The\nworld has experienced more than enough\ndamaging talk, not to mention wars.\n\nThe core principles of Xi’s belt and road\nstrategy must be always applied in China's\ninteractions with local strategies. If China\nis, as German Foreign Minister Sigmar\nGabriel told the Munich Security\nConference in February, “the only country\nin the world with any sort of genuinely\nglobal, geostrategic concept”, then\nWestern leaders should cultivate a\ngenuinely global strategy in line with\nChina's vision, for the betterment of all\nhumankind.\n\nWenshan Jia, PhD, is a professor in the\nSchool of Communication, at Chapman.\nUniversity (California) and a research fellow\natthe National Academy of Development.\nand Strategy, Renmin University of China\n\nPrivate clubs\ndeserve ‘cushy’\nrental deals\n\nEdith Terry says private recreational\nclubs are part of Hong Kong’s\nheritage and have contributed to\nnurturing less popular sports, as\nwell as a unique hybrid culture\n\nfirst job, went in search of a social group. He founda\nhome away from home in Hong Kong's oldest\nprivate recreational club, newly relocated froma prime\nlocation on Victoria Harbour, where City Hall is today,\ntoa modest flagstone boathouse beneath Island Road\non Hong Kong's south side. Fifty-five years later, Frank\nPfeiffer, a Zen Buddhist and mountain climber, is still\nanactive member of the Victoria Recreation Club,\nestablished in 1849. He has watched it ring the changes\nfrom Hong Kong's colonial society in the 1960s, when it\nhad only two Chinese members and no female\nmembers, to the hybrid institution it is today, under its\nfirst Hong Kong Chinese chairman, Wu Kam Shing.\n\nIts membership is a spectrum of Hong Kong's\ndiverse and athletically minded middle class. There is\nthe Hong Kong Chinese court reporter who visits the\nclub in Deep Water Bay every morning at 6am on her\nway from home in Ap Lei Chau to her workplace in Sha\nTin. There are her fellow swimmers, many elderly, who\nswim outto the buoys, rain or shine, hot or cold, eve\nday. Some 100-150 “paddlers” use the club as a base for\noutrigger canoeing, dragon boating and paddle\nboarding. Some of the sports were unknown to Hong\nKong before the club nurtured them, others, like\ndragon boating, are deeply traditional.\n\nIn the current debate over the future of the 67\nprivate recreational clubs that pay minimal rents to the\ngovernment, history has been swept aside. True, they\nwere designed on a colonial template, in which the\ndiverse ethnic groups were given separate retreats.\nMembership at the pinnacle clubs was reserved\nprimarily for the British. For other ethnic groups, there\nwas a Chinese Recreation Club, a Club de Recreio, a\nHlipiie Club, an Indian Recreation Club, andso on.\n\nlong Kong's colonial rulers reviewed the lease\nsystem for the private clubs in 1968 and 1979, andin\nthe run-up to the handover in 1997 when leases were\nrestricted to 15-year terms. At the handover, anumber\nof leases were extended to ensure a so-called smooth\ntransition. The sceptic would argue that this was a\ndodge, and indeed in 2011, during the first post-1997\nreview of private recreational leases oy the Legislative\nCouncil, most of the clubs seemed oblivious to public\nconcerns as well as new requirements for “opening up”\n\nThe government argued\nthat subsidies were\nneeded because use of land\nfor sports and recreation\nwould never trump\ncommercial utilisation\n\nI 1964, ayoung German, fresh off the plane athis\n\nto schools and community organisations, Following\nthe last well-publicised review in 2013 and the current\ninvestigation seeking new venues for public housing,\ntheyareno longer complacent.\n\nShould the private clubs have got their cushy rental\ndeals in the first place? At the time of the reviews 50\nyears ago, the government argued that subsidies were\nneeded because use ofland for sports and recreation\nwould never trump commercial utilisation. What was\ntrue then is even more so today. The high cost ofland in\nHong Kongis dragon innovation and creativity. The\nexistence of the private recreational clubs means ithas\nbeen less ofa dragon sports.\n\nMost of the clubs with governmentleases are\nframed around core sports golf, tennis, horse racing,\nswimming sailing and rowing, to namea few. Hong\nKong athletes whose development was: supported by\nthese clubs have gone to the Olympics and other\ninternational competitions. In the 1940s, the Victoria\nRecreation Club was the driving force behind Hong,\nKong's participation in the International Olympic\nCommittee and the Hong Kong Sports Federation.\n\nPublic pressure on the clubs to forge community\nties and contribute to Hong Kong through “opening\nup” schemes is appropriate—but not the pressure to\nconvert their land to high-rise estates. The loss is not\nonly to the core sports they represent but also to their\nunique DNA, which is the foundation of Hong Kong—\ndiverse, cosmopolitan and adventurous. If you want to\nlook for a Hong Kong that is not just about money, one\nplace tolookishere.\n\nEdith Terry is the honorary secretary of the Victoria\nRecreation Club.
