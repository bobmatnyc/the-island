  "text": "826\n\nnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at 104. Proximate\ncause will support this connection. See\nFurst Nationurde Bank v. Gelt Funding\nCorp., 27 F.3d 768, 769 (2d Cir.1994)\n(“Central to the notion of proximate cause\nis the idea that a person is not liable to all\nthose who may have been injured by his\nconduct, but only to those with respect to\nwhom his acts were a substantial factor in\nthe sequence of responsible causation, and\nwhose injury was reasonably foreseeable\nor anticipated as a natural consequence.”).\nIn light of al Qaeda’s public acknowledg-\nments of its war against the United States,\nthe September 11 attacks may be the natu-\nral and probable consequence of knowingly\nand intentionally providing material sup-\nport to al Qaeda. Burnett [, 274\nF.Supp.2d at 104.\n\n[72] Plaintiffs rely on theories of con-\ncerted action liability—conspiracy and aid-\ning and abetting—in support of this causal\nlink. “Concerted action liability under\nNew York law is based on the principle\nthat ‘[a]ll those who, in pursuance of a\ncommon plan or design to commit a tor-\ntious act, actively take part in it, or further\nit by cooperation or request, or who lend\naid or encouragement to the wrongdoer\n\n. are equally liable with him.” Putt-\nman, 149 F.3d at 122 (quoting Bichler v.\nEli Lilly & Co. 55 N.Y.2d 571, 580, 450\nN.Y.S.2d 776, 486 N.E.2d 182 (1982)). To\nbe liable under either conspiracy or aiding\nand abetting, however, the defendant\n“must know the wrongful nature of the\nprimary actor’s conduct,” zd. at 128, and\nthe conduct must be tied to a substantive\ncause of action, Chrysler Capital Corp.,\n778 F.Supp. at 1267. In this regard, Plain-\ntiffs rely on the ATCA, RICO, the TVPA,\nthe ATA, and various state laws, including\nwrongful death, survival, intentional inflic-\ntion of emotional distress, trespass, assault\nand battery, negligence, and negligent in-\nfliction of emotional distress.\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\n1. ATCA\n\n[73] The Alien Tort Claims Act pro-\nvides that “[t]he district courts shall have\noriginal jurisdiction of any civil action by\nan alien for a tort only, committed in viola-\ntion of the law of nations or a treaty of the\nUnited States.” 28 U.S.C. § 1350. “This\nstatute confers subject matter jurisdiction\nwhen the following three conditions are\nsatisfied: (1) an alien sues (2) for a tort (3)\ncommitted in violation of the law of nations\n(i.e., international law).” Kadic v. Karad-\nzic, 70 F.8d 232, 238 (2d Cir.1995); see\nalso Flores v. Southern Peru Corp., 348\nF.3d 140, 143 n. 2 (2d Cir.2003). Certain\nPlaintiffs in these actions are aliens and\nthe complaints all allege common law torts.\nThe Court finds that “aircraft hijacking is\ngenerally recognized as a violation of inter-\nnational law.” Burnett I, 274 F.Supp.2d at\n100 (citing Kadic, 70 F.3d at 240; Bigio v.\nCoca-Cola Co., 239 F.3d 440, 447-49 (2d\nCir.2000)). Further, “courts, including the\nSecond Circuit, have almost unanimously\npermitted actions premised on a theory of\naiding and abetting and conspiracy.”\nPresbyterian Church of Sudan v. Talrs-\nman Energy, Inc., 244 F.Supp.2d 289, 311\n(S.D.N.Y.2003). Accordingly, the ATCA\nmay provide a basis for a concerted action\nclaim of material support by alien-Plain-\ntiffs here. See Burnett [, 274 F.Supp.2d at\n100.\n\n2. RICO\n\n“To state a claim under civil RICO, a\nplaintiff must plead seven elements: (1)\nthat the defendant (2) through the commis-\nsion of two or more acts (8) constituting a\n‘pattern’ (4) of ‘racketeering activity’ (©)\ndirectly or indirectly invests in, maintains\nan interest in, or participates in (6) an\n‘enterprise’ (7) the activities of which affect\ninterstate or foreign commerce.” Berk v.\nTradewell, Inc., Nos. 01 Civ. 9035, 01 Civ.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017891",
