The conquests of Israel occur when\npowers not adjacent to it begin forming empires. Babylon, Persia,\nMacedonia, Rome, Turkey and Britain all controlled Israel\npolitically, sometimes for worse and sometimes for better. Each\ndominated it militarily, but none was a neighbor of Israel. This is a\nconsistent pattern. Israel can resist its neighbors; danger arises when\nmore distant powers begin playing imperial games. Empires can bring\nforce to bear that Israel cannot resist.\n\nIsrael therefore has this problem: It would be secure if it could\nconfine itself to protecting its interests from neighbors, but it cannot\nconfine itself because its geographic location invariably draws larger,\nmore distant powers toward Israel. Therefore, while Israel's military\ncan focus only on immediate interests, its diplomatic interests must\nlook much further. Israel is constantly entangled with global interests\n(as the globe is defined at any point), seeking to deflect and align\nwith broader global powers. When it fails in this diplomacy, the\nconsequences can be catastrophic.\n\nIsrael exists in three conditions. First, it can be a completely\nindependent state. This condition occurs when there are no major\nimperial powers external to the region. We might call this the David\nmodel. Second, it can live as part of an imperial system — either as a\nsubordinate ally, as a moderately autonomous entity or as a satrapy.\nIn any case, it maintains its identity but loses room for independent\nmaneuvering in foreign policy and potentially in domestic policy. We\nmight call this the Persian model in its most beneficent form. Finally,\nIsrael can be completely crushed — with mass deportations and\nmigrations, with a complete loss of autonomy and minimal residual\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031868",
