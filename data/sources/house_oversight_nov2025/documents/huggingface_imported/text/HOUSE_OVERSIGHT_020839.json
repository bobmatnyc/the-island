  "text": "Improving operating efficiency.\n\nWith nearly one government civilian worker (federal, state and local) for every six households,\nefficiency gains seem possible. A 20-year trend line of declining federal civilian headcount was\nreversed in the late 1990s.\n\nResuming that trend would imply a 15% potential headcount reduction over five years and save\nnearly $300 billion over the next ten years. USA Inc. could also focus intensively on local private\ncompany outsourcing, where state and local governments are finding real productivity gains.\n\nImproving long-term GDP growth — productivity and employment.\n\nFundamentally, federal revenues depend on GDP growth and related tax levies on consumers\nand businesses. Higher GDP growth won't be easy to achieve as households rebuild savings in\nthe aftermath of a recession. To break even without changing expense levels or tax policies,\nUSA Inc. would need real GDP growth of 6-7% in F2012-14 and 4-5% in F2015-20, according to\nour estimates based on CBO data — highly unlikely, given 40-year average GDP growth of 3%.\nWhile USA Inc. could temporarily increase government spending and investment to make up for\nlower private demand in the near term, the country needs policies that foster productivity and\nemployment gains for sustainable long-term economic growth.\n\nHow Much Would Real GDP Need to Grow to Drive USA Inc. to Break-Even\nWithout Policy Changes? 6-7% in F2012E-F2014E & 4-5% in F2015-\n\nF2020E...Well Above 40-Year Average of 3%\n\nCBO’s Baseline Real GDP Growth vs. Required Real GDP\nGrowth for a Balanced Budget Between F2011E and F2020E\n\nA%\n\nReal GDP Y/Y Growth (%)\nN\nsz\n\n200: 2011E 2013E 2015E 2017E 2019E\n\nReal GDP Annual Growth (CBO Baseline Forecast) =\nReal GDP Annual Growth Needed to Eliminate Fiscal Deficit\n— -1970-2009 Average Real GDP Growth\n\nKP Source: CBO, “The Budget and Economic Outlook: Fiscal Years 2010 to 2020,” 8/10.\n§@S) www kpcb.com USA Inc. | Summary\n\nProductivity gains and increased employment each contributed roughly half of the long-term\nGDP growth between 1970 and 2009, per the National Bureau of Economic Research. Since the\n1960s, as more resources have gone to entitlements and interest payments, USA Inc. has\nscaled back its investment in technology R&D and infrastructure as percentages of GDP.\nCompetitors are making these investments. India plans to double infrastructure spending as a\npercent of GDP by 2013, and its tertiary (college) educated population will double over the next\nten years, according to Morgan Stanley analysts, enabling its GDP growth to accelerate to 9-\n10% annually by 2015 (China’s annual GDP growth is forecast to remain near 8% by 2015).\nUSA Inc. can’t match India’s demographic advantage, but technology can help.\n\nKP\n\nCB www.kpcb.com USA Inc. xvi\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020839",
