As we know now, he pointed out, Rus-\nsia and China probably had access to the 127-page standard form in\nhis personnel file that he updated in 2011. They also had the capa-\nbility to track his air travel to Hong Kong. “Could someone have\nsteered him to Hong Kong?” I asked. He answered, with a shrug,\n“That depends on whether Snowden had a confidante who could\nhave influenced him.”\n\nWhenever adversaries became aware of Snowden in this scenario,\nit was not until after he copied the NSA secrets and took them with\nhim to Hong Kong that Russian intelligence officers offered him a\ndeal. So from the Russian point of view, Snowden had already burned\nhis bridges. Because he had used other people’s passwords and access\nprivileges to get into computers that he was not authorized to use,\nillegally moved documents, and given a false reason for his medi-\ncal leave, it was only a matter of time, as he told Greenwald in his\ninterview in Hong Kong, before NSA investigators would identify\nhim as a possible spy. He could be of no further use at the NSA to an\nadversary. His intelligence value now lay in the documents he had\n\n© taken with him or stored in the cloud as well as his ability to help ©\nclarify them in debriefing sessions. He could also inflict damage on\nthe morale and public standing of the NSA by denouncing its spying\nin the media.\n\nOnce Snowden was in Hong Kong, the Russians would have no\nreason to restrain him from holding a press event or releasing a\nvideo. In fact, the KGB had organized press conferences for all the\nprevious NSA defectors to Moscow. Hong Kong was a perfect venue\nfor a well-staged media event because all the major newspapers in\nthe world had bureaus there. Snowden’s disclosures about NSA spy-\ning could serve to weaken the NSA’s relations with its allies.\n\nIt is also possible that Russian or Chinese intelligence did not\nbecome aware of Snowden until after he went public in June by\nhaving The Guardian release his video. The video would have con-\nvinced the Russians or the Chinese of how dissatisfied Snowden was\nwith the NSA. Because dissatisfaction is one of the classic means of\nrecruitment in the intelligence business, he would certainly become\na prime target for recruitment after he went public.\n\nThe CIA also considered the possibility that Snowden might\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 163 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019651",
