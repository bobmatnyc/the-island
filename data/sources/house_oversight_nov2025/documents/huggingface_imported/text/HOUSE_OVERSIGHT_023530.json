I would support not only Netanyahu, but the far-right parties\nof his governing coalition, the parties that seem uninterested in\ndemocracy and obsessed with planting more Jewish settlements on\nthe West Bank.\n\nThe settlements would have my wholehearted backing. I would\nencourage my brother Palestinians to help build settlements at a brisk\npace. I would ask the Israelis to build an even more intricate system\nof bypass roads on the West Bank that would connect Jewish\nsettlements to one another and to Israel proper. I would ask my\nostensible allies among the Arab nations to provide interest-free\nmortgages to Israelis in Tel Aviv, so they could move out to the\nsettlements for some fresh air and a little more yard. And, while I was\nat it, I would insist that my leaders abort their campaign for United\nNations recognition of an independent state of Palestine.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023530",
