  "text": "system. There are some early indicators of international economic recovery. Yet, I cannot predict that the\nglobal economic recovery will proceed without potential hurdles. I cannot also claim that repercussions of the\neconomic financial meltdown are over yet. But what I can say is that the worst is already behind us, and there is\nnow a solid will and determination among concerned countries to join hands to collectively revive the global\neconomy as well as their own individual economies.\n\nIncreasing financial support to other business sectors is probable, pending the actual needs of each particular\nsector. The UAE’s tourism sector is ina good shape, with UAE hotels recording high occupancy rates. The\ncountry’s tourism industry has already successful survived the worst period and resiliently adapted itself during\nthe most critical times.\n\nPAUL STOBER, Gulf News\n\nWhat are the main strengths and weaknesses of the UAE, as it faces the challenge of the\nglobal economic slowdown? What are the particular challenges that Dubai faces as it\npositions itself as a global business centre?\n\nThe UAE’s strengths are numerous. The UAE’s success in facing the global financial crisis and alleviating its\nimpact on the Emirati economy is the most conspicuous=2 Oevidence of these strengths. The country enjoys a\nleading ranking position in several fields such as productivity, environment, connectivity, and transformation\nto knowledge economy. Yet the failure to match best international practices in these fields might be considered\na major weakness. We always benchmark ourselves against the best. I always say that we have just embarked\non a long journey of hard work to fulfil our promised sustainable development through a series of strategic\nprojects to be established during the years to come.\n\nDURAID AL BAIK, Gulf News:\n\nDo you feel that Dubai needs an efficient auditing body to investigate and curb\ncorruption in financial institutions before things become too bad? How more the UAE\ncan move faster in fighting corruption and promoting transparency?\n\nThere is already a government financial audit department. The department has a track record of successful\nperformance, and it has done very well with investigations related to corruption cases. Enhancing financial\nauditing systems and capabilities is undoubtedly important and that is exactly what we are doing now. As for\npromoting transparency in fighting corruption, I confirm that the UAE is completely committed to highest\nlevels of transparency. There is no room for corrupt officials and citizens among us. Handling corruption cases\ndoes not mean prosecuting judging and penalising corrupt individuals only; it also aims at filling all\nadministrative and legal loopholes that=2 Ohave been used to breach the law.\n\nBy Al Bayan newspaper\n\nWhen will the term “remote” (rural) areas disappear from the everyday vocabulary of\nthe UAE?\n\nThe UAE does not have remote areas in the negative connotation of the word. We only have areas that are\nrelatively remote from urban centers. The urban planning of these areas has to be based on scientific research to\ncarefully identify means of providing best efficient services to local residents.\n\nThere are sometimes exaggerated reports depicting these areas as if they are utterly deprived of basic services\n\nwhile their residents live in appalling conditions. Sometimes, one reads press reports demanding a school to be\nbuilt in an area that has no more than 50 homes, while there is a school only few kilometers away with available\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024951",
