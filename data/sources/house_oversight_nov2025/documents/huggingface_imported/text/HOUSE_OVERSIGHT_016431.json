  "text": "Epstein at his Palm Beach mansion while she was a sophomore at Royal Palm Beach High School.\nEMILY MICHOT EMICHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM\n\nAfter he hung up, the man turned over and dropped his towel, exposing himself.\nHe told Licata to get comfortable and then, in a firm voice, told her to take off\nher clothes.\n\nAt 16, Licata had never before been fully naked in front of anyone. Shaking and\npanicked, she mechanically pulled off her jeans and stripped down to her\nunderwear. He set the timer for 30 minutes and then reached over and\nunsnapped her bra. He then began touching her with one hand and masturbating\nhimself with the other.\n\n“I kept looking at the timer because I didn’t want to have this mental image of\nwhat he was doing,”’ she remembered of the massage. “He kept trying to put his\nfingers inside me and told me to pinch his nipples. He was mostly saying ‘just do\nthat, harder, harder and do this. ...’ ”\n\nAfter he ejaculated, he stood up and walked to the shower, dismissing her as if\nshe had been in history class.\n\nIt wasn’t long before a lot of Licata’s fellow students at Royal Palm Beach High\nSchool had heard about “a creepy old guy” named Jeffrey who lived in a pink\nwaterfront mansion and was paying girls $200 to $300 to give him massages that\nquickly turned sexual.\n\nEventually, the Palm Beach police, and then the FBI, came knocking on Licata’s\ndoor. In the police report, Licata was referred to as a Jane Doe in order to protect\nher identity as a minor.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016431",
