We are dealing with high-profile\nclients on Tim’s behalf and the proper writing techniques and\nmessage says a lot about his team.\n\n¢ » Become as familiar as you can with his book and his website as to\nanswer questions accordingly.\n\nContact Information\n\nTim Ferriss\n\n[mailing address]\n\nTim Cell (your use only): [private cell]\nNumber to give others: [GrandCentral number]\nSkype: XXXXX\n\nBilling Address (Private):\n\n[billing address]\n\nPurchases\nASK [head VA], for his AMEX NUMBER. SHE WILL ADVISE WHETHER PURCHASES CAN BE\nAPPROVED.\n\nQuestion and Answer (Preferences)\n\n1. How do you feel about joint ventures?\n\nI’m open to them, but my brand and respectability is #1. I will not do anything with anyone who\ncomes off as deceptive or amateur. “Make millions while you sleep in our super-insane foreclosure\nprogram!” on the website disqualifies someone. I cannot be associated with anyone who might be\nseen as a liar or snake-oil salesman. Just ask yourself: If the CEO of a well-known company saw\nthis, would he lose interest in speaking with me? If so, it won’t work.\n\nFor those who pass that criteria, what have they done already? I’m not looking for first-timers,\ngenerally, unless they have an excellent track record and reputation elsewhere.\n\n2. Do you focus solely on profit- generating tasks?\n\nNo. I also look for prestige (Harvard, government, etc.), wide exposure, as well as building\nnetworks with people who have world-class skills in some area.\n\n3. | How do you handle spam?\nSpamArrest and Gmail. I have no problem with spam at this point.\n\n4. What is your optimal response rate (i.e., respond to all e-mails no later than 48-72 hours after\nreceived)?\n\nSame day. I’m bringing you on to respond quickly.\n5. Do you respond to any e-mails?\n\nYes, but P’Il want you to filter them first, respond to all you can, then mark the ones I should look\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014009",
