  "text": "J Street, the left-leaning alternative to the more established American\nIsrael Public Affairs Committee, put out a statement of support for\nMr. Obama on Wednesday. “To oppose the president without laying\nout a credible alternative basis for a two-state solution is to embrace a\nstatus quo leading to the eventual loss of Israel as we know and love\nit,” its statement said.\n\nMr. Obama’s proposal, the group said, is supported by many Jews in\nthe United States and Israel. It is “the path that most of Israel’s recent\nprime ministers have attempted to blaze, from Rabin to Barak to\nOlmert.”\n\nRepublicans, however, are confident that their emphasis on\nunconditional support for Israel holds appeal both for many Jews and\nfor conservative Christians.\n\nYet it is the Republican Party’s close identification with evangelical\nChristians in recent years that is perhaps its biggest hurdle to winning\nover significant numbers of Jewish voters and donors. On issues that\nare crucial to the conservative Republican base — like opposition to\nabortion, gay rights, liberalized immigration and much government\nspending — most American Jews are on the other side, and strongly\nSO.\n\n“If Republicans can mischaracterize this president as anti-Israel, they\ncan distract from the fact that on every other issue their party is in\ndisagreement with the American-Jewish community,” said David A.\nHarris, president of the National Jewish Democratic Council, a group\nof Jewish-American Democratic activists.\n\nMr. Netanyahu on Monday experienced first-hand the tension arising\nfrom that complaint among Democrats, and Republicans’ rejection of\nit, in a private meeting he held with representatives of the National\nJewish Democratic Council and the Republican Jewish Coalition to\nunderscore American Jews’ bipartisan consensus on Israel.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023523",
