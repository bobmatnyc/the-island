  "text": "The Yippies and the Occupiers\n\nAs a co-founder of the Yippies (Youth International Party)—known\nfor demonstrating against the Vietnam War at the 1968 Democratic\nconvention in Chicago--| find myself comparing and contrasting the\nYippies and the Occupy Wall Street protesters.\n\nWe had to perform stunts to get media coverage of our cause, so a\ngroup of us went to the New York Stock Exchange, upstairs to the balcony,\nand threw $200 worth of singles onto the floor below, watching the gang\nof manic brokers suddenly morph from yelling \"Pork Bellies\" into playing\n\"Diving for Dollars.\" Then we held a press conference outside, explaining\nthe connection between the capitalist system and the war.\n\nNow, a particular placard, “Wall Street Is War Street,” gives me a\nsense of continuity. Other anonymous Occupier spokespersons carried\nposters proclaiming: “God Forbid We Have Sex & Smoke Pot. They Want\nUs to Grab Guns & Go to War!\" = “I am an immigrant. | came here to take\nyour job. But you don’ t have one.” “$96,000 for a BA in Hispanic\ntransgender gay & lesbian studies and | can’ t find work!” And a woman\n\nin a wheelchair: “Stand Up For Your Rights!”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015335",
