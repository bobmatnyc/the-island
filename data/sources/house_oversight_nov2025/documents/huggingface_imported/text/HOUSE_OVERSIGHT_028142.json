  "text": "/ BARAK / 8\n\nWithin days of the election, however, there was a new source of potential\nfriction between us: Shimon’s future, and possibly mine, in leading our opposition\nto Bibi and bringing a Labor government back to power.\n\nThe question of Peres’s leadership was unavoidable. Labor’s constitution\nmandated a vote for party chairman within 14 months of an election defeat. But the\nwidespread assumption was that Shimon would run again. A little before midnight\non election day, with the returns beginning to show we might lose, I was invited to\na morning-after breakfast by two senior Labor ministers: Fuad Ben-Eliezer, the\nman who had delivered the table-thumping warning that the hatred on the far-right\nwould lead to a murder, and Avraham Shochat, Finance Minister under both Rabin\nand Peres. Both had been in the Knesset since the 1980s. Both were part of two of\nPeres’s earlier, failed, election campaigns. Both now said that they weren’t\nprepared to see him lead us into electoral battle the next time around. “Everyone in\nthe party understands the meaning of this defeat. Shimon is done,” Shochat said, as\nFuad nodded his agreement. “You will have to go for the leadership.”\n\nThough their endorsement was a surprise, it would be disingenuous to pretend I\nhadn’t been thinking, at some stage in the future, of running for the party\nleadership. But my election-campaign differences with Ramon and Peres were not\njust for the sake of intellectual argument. I badly wanted us to win: both for Peres’s\nsake and the country’s, and to redeem and continue all that Yitzhak had sacrificed.\nDespite my misgivings about some aspects of the Oslo process, I did believe there\nwas a possibility of achieving peace with the Palestinians. I knew, from my\ninvolvement in the talks with the Syrians, that the outline of a possible peace\nagreement with Assad was already in place. I frankly wasn’t confident that Bibi\nwas the man to lead it forward. Yes, he was smart. He was organizationally astute.\nHe’d been a good sayeret officer. Yet as I'd said it my TV spot, being Prime\nMinister required much more than that. I was now an elected Knesset member. But\nI had gone into politics in the hope of making a difference to how Israel confronted\nits defining challenges of war and peace. The prospect of spending the next few as\na mere opposition foot soldier, making speeches and sitting in committee sessions,\n\n294\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028142",
