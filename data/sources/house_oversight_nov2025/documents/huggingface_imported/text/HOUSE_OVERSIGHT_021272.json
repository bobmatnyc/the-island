  "text": "to others are weakening and to motivate\nthe repair and maintenance of the\nconnections to others that are needed for\nour health and well being as for the\nsurvival of our genes (27). Physical pain\nis an aversive signal that evolved to\nmotivate one to take action that\nminimizes damage to one’s body.\nLoneliness is an aversive signal that\nevolved to motivate one to take action\nthat minimizes damage to one’s social\n\nbody.\n\nPeople differ dispositionally in\ntheir sensitivity to the pain of social\ndisconnection (1.e., feelings of\nloneliness; 28) just as people differ in\nsensitivity to physical pain. Ostracism\nor objective isolation in most species is\nassociated with an early death (29). In\nhumans, the chronic feeling of social\nisolation, even when the person remains\namong the protective embrace of others,\nis associated with significant mental and\nphysical disorders (30). Chronic hunger,\nthirst, and pain can also have deleterious\neffects for, like loneliness, their adaptive\nvalue lies in their effects as acute\nsignals, not as chronic conditions. The\nopposite of feeling hunger, thirst, pain,\nor loneliness is feeling normal, and this\nis the state in which most people exist\nmost of the time.\n\nThe social connections formed\nby humans need not be based on genetic\nsimilarities. The human species has\nevolved the capacity for and motivation\nto form relationships not only with other\nindividuals but also with groups (e.g., a\nChicago Cubs or Boston Red Sox fan)\nand nonhuman entities (e.g., through\nanthropomorphism, 3/). Team spirit and\nschool spirit are familiar notions, and\nalthough team or school spirit refers to\nan invisible influence, it is an invisible\ninfluence that is no less open to rigorous\nscientific inquiry than are the invisible\n\nPage |26\n\ninfluences of gravity or magnetic flux.\nIn the cases of team and school spirit,\nthis influence represents a specific form\nof social connection between an\nindividual and an emergent structure.\n\nPerceived social connections are\nabstractions that can transcend time and\nspace. People may feel a connection\nwith their ancestors or family heritage\neven if they are the only remaining\ndescendant, just as people can perceive\npersonal connections with pets, cars,\ntelevision characters, celebrities, and\nunseen spiritual entities with whom they\ndo not actually interact. A potent\ncomponent of spirituality (that does not\ndepend on a specific religion) is the\nfeeling of connection and purpose that\ncome from forming a relationship with a\nhigher being. A simple byproduct of our\nselfish genes and social brains may be\nour search for meaning in and\nconnection with broader organizations or\nbeings.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn 1939, the astrophysicist Sir Arthur\nEddington published a book entitled The\nPhilosophy of physical science (32). In it he\ndescribes a hypothetical scientist who sought\nto determine the size of the various fish in the\nsea. The scientist began by weaving a 2-inch\nmesh net and setting sail across the seas,\nrepeatedly sampling catches and carefully\nmeasuring, recording, and analyzing the\nresults of each catch. After extensive\nsampling, the scientist concluded that there\nwere no fish smaller than two inches in the\nsea. The moral of Sir Eddington's analogy is\ntwofold. First, scientific instruments are\nshaped by people’s intuitive theories of the\nphenomena to be investigated. Second, once\ndeveloped, scientific expectations and\ninstruments shape data and theory in ways\nmore powerfully and fundamentally than are\noften appreciated.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021272",
