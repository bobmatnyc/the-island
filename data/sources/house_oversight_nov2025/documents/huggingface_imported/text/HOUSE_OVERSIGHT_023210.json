  "text": "TODAY\n\nWith your acquiesence , Eileen did not report to Delson ( he acting as a conduit directly to me) , she\ncontinued to provide bad info to both you ( cash flows , stock accts, structures. sales Etc) and me.\nand each time with my many annoying calls to you made immediately afterwards that she was g....-y !!\nNo one was hired to run YOUR office until two months ago , no one was even interviewed and even\nnow , Brad, a very nice man, 1s not even full time,(crazy ) Hours upon hours of time need to be spent\ntraining him . and his new staff. Eileen followed your instructions. not mine. in fact she continued to\nignore mine saying \" but Leon said \"or\" its on Leon's desk etc\", You would become frustrated\nwhen 1 pointed out each instance. of her obfuscation. originally you were given the clear choice, but\nto save money ,you chose not to hire my team . I was hired to do the architecture, you kept your own\nteam. with Eileen at the head. instructions were given by me, , detailed but ignored by her. ( except in\nthe instances where I inserted myself and personally had to do the weeks of grunt work\n),ex. jpm morgan acct still not in use? That being said, If you do the cold calculation ,starting from\nwhere you were, to where you are currently . you have made a hell ofa deal. -- negotiating down\nmy original amount requested , calling upon our friendship and suggesting that the Carlyn mess was\npartially my fault. (though in that specific example , I had never been asked to do more than merely\nprovide you the name of the most highly recognized atty in the field, not consulted,nor even asked\nagain for my guidance along the way. ).I accepted the discount as your friend. ( by the way\nsuggesting now, that your Tom is now that last word on tax characterization, frankly 1s a bit much,-).\nhowever - that is all in the past.\n\nIn order to move forward\n\nI would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal\nattention and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues\nlast year. . As you are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I\nhave decided 1 will have this year for my time . (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also\nask that you keep in mind that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your\nunderstanding of the final payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up\nyour way. ) I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and\nover/ until once again, I was forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made\nserious dollar and time concessions last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate\nsome of your concerns , but I am, under no circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free.\nits not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We\nwere both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you found yourself last year, and in fact due\npredominately to its seriousness. and those very circumstances I took extra care in our negotiations .\n(you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very close friend.),\nunfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your\nown design )\n\nI heard you when you said you believed 1 had already been paid for the work that is now required. The\nart partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so.\n. (FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title.) You will also recall\nthat you required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .(\nmy work was never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of\ncourse should make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past\nagreement at all. I pointed this very fact out to you when IJ initially proposed a multi year agreement\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023210",
