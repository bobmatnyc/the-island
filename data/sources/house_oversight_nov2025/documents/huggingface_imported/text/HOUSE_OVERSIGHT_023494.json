  "text": "In addition to “setting the goal of a world free of nuclear weapons,”\nthe 2007 statement argued for a number of practical measures to\ndiminish the likelihood that nuclear weapons would fall into\n“dangerous hands,” or that they would be launched by accident, or\nthat countries interested in, but not now possessing, such weapons\nwould succeed in acquiring them. A number of these measures are\ndoable and desirable, but some are dubious. Altering the posture of\nnuclear weapons now deployed so that they need not be launched\nurgently, thereby increasing warning time and diminishing the danger\nof an accidental or unauthorized launch, would be a useful thing to\ndo—although there is room for debate about how best to accomplish\nthis. The end of the Cold War should have brought an end to\ndeterrent forces poised for instantaneous launch (which in the\nextreme case could mean launching missiles on the strength of radar\nwarnings) but, unfortunately and dangerously, old habits die hard.\nReducing or eliminating the number of short-range nuclear weapons\nthat are designed to be forward deployed would also be useful, since\nthese are the small, highly mobile weapons that could fall into the\nwrong hands far more readily than large, central strategic systems that\nare carefully controlled. Most of the short-range weapons deployed\ntoday are Russian, however, and the Russians have resisted American\nproposals to adopt limits on their number. (Given Russia’s strong\ninterest in limiting strategic weapons, it is difficult to understand why\nthe Obama administration did not insist on some limits on short-\nrange nuclear weapons as a condition for the New START Treaty.\nUnused leverage is a squandered opportunity.)\n\n“Providing the highest possible standards of security for all stocks of\nweapons, weapons-useable plutonium and highly enriched uranium\neverywhere in the world,” another of the 2007 statement’s\nrecommendations, is an obvious thing to do.
