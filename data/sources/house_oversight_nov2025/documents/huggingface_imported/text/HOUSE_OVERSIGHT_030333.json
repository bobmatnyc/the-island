Allegations levelled at the Prince are that he \nwas supplied with a teenage girl who was used by Epstein as a \"sex slave\". Buckingham \nPalace has denied the allegation. \nThe 'black book' that Rodriguez had in his possession is journal in which Epstein is \nunderstood to have detailed the girls which attended his properties for \"massages\" for him \nand his friends, and details of his celebrity friends and associates who had no connection \nwith alleged offences, including Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. \nJeffrey Epstein: Controversies surrounding paedophile billionaire  \nRodriguez, who stole the book, claimed he needed it as insurance against the businessman \nto protect his own life. \nThe butler failed to tell prosecutors he possessed the book and later refused to hand it over. \nHe was jailed for 18 months for attempting to sell it for $50,000 (01,000). \nIn 2011 it emerged that the journal \"detailed the full scope and the extent of Epstein's \ninvolvement with underage girls,\" according to prosecuting lawyers, who referred to it as \n\"The Holy Grail\". \nRodriguez died on 28 December.
