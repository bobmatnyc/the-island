She needs the exposure. Notice her cleavage.\n\nSee the handsome man. He does know that it's for leukemia.\nYou can tell. He is singing a calypso melody. Listen to the lyrics.\n\n“Give-your-money,” he sings, “to-leukemia. Give-your-money, to-\nleukemia.” Listen to the audience applaud. He is very talented.\n\nSee the sincere politician.
