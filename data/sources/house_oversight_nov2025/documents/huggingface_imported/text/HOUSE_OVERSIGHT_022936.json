I'm not sure you do. Be back for what? Where? I don't need to be photographed. I am trying\nto avoid that, hence the reason why I moved out here. I don't need people coming here looking for me to give\nthem information about you or the \"people\" I was documented with... It's not my property. I don't think you get\nIt.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 19, 2016, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\ni appreciate it.

I can not have press,\nmedia, private investigators, film companies, etc. contacting me or my parents and sisters at home or on cell/texts and or by mail. I\nrealize you don’t have much control over this, but you can at least help me to move. I can’t just get up and go like you. I left the\ncity to escape, make a better life and I am devastated these people found me and brought to light an association of that I would\nrather them never to know. People think I was involved with something really bad and I lost a boyfriend of great potential over\nthis shit. I am still in debt over all these years, been working my ass off trying to get ahead, which you could never understand I\nwas even surviving off the pay I was getting. Well, its not any better. I dropped out of college because of you (and GM’s) advice.\nStarted working for a company you wanted me to and basically my life has has become hell since then.\n\nI have been your supporter for 16 years, the media explosion with Clinton, Trump and Cosby is affecting me. I'm not prepared for\nthis.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
