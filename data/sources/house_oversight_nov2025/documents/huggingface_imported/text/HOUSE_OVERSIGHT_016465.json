This is not particular to People v. Epstein; it is routine\nacross our appellate filings. My understanding is that it is also the Appellate Division’s (the court's)\npractice to maintain such seal.\n\nThat being said, | have discussed your second question with our attorneys. If the Post petitions the\ncourt, and the court asks the People for our positon, we will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief.\n\nThanks.\n\nDanny Frost\nDirector of Communications\nManhattan District Attorney Cy Vance, Jr.\n\n212-335-9400 // @ManhattanDA\n\nFrom: Susan Edelman [mailto:sedelman@nypost.com]\nSent: Thursday, December 6, 2018 9:12 AM\n\nTo: Frost, Danny <frostd@dany.nyc.gov>\n\nSubject: Re: request\n\nHi Dan,\n\nPlease explain why the DA's office didn't file a redacted brief, but rather covered up all the facts.\nIf we filed a petition for a redacted brief, would the DA's office fight it or cooperate?\n\nThank you,\n\nSue\n\nSusan Edelman\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016465",
