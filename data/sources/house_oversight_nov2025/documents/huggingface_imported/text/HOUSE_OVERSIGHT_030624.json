She alleges that she was paid $15k for this encounter. \nShe claims that on another occasion, Mr Epstein flew two young women to a dinner for the purpose of \nentertaining President Clinton. She claims she herself was sex trafficked to several other men, whose contact \ninformation is contained in an address book of Mr Epstein's filed in court records. \nMay we have a comment please?
