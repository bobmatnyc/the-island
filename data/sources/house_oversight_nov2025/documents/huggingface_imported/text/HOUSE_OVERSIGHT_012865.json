Their\nactions are inhuman, unimaginable, rarely witnessed, and detrimental to our species’ survival. This\nimpression carries with it an assumption about what is expected or typical of our species, as well as what\nis possible.

Their actions are unimaginable because most human minds lack the capacity\n\nHauser Chapter 4. Wicked in waiting 119\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012865",
