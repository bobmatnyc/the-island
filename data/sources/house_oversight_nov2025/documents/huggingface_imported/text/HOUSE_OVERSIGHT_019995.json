  "text": "The inaugural, largely written by Bannon and Stephen Miller, had shocked Jared and\nIvanka. But a particular peculiarity of the Trump White House, compounding its\nmessaging problems, was its lack of a speech-writing team. There was the literate and\nhighly verbal Bannon, who did not really do any actual writing himself; there was Stephen\nMiller, who did little more than produce bullet points. Beyond that, it was pretty much just\ncatch as catch can. There was a lack of coherent message because there was nobody to\nwrite a coherent message—just one more instance of disregarding political craft.\n\nIvanka grabbed firm control of the joint session draft and quickly began pulling in\ncontributions from the Jarvanka camp. In the event, the president behaved exactly as they\nhoped. Here was an upbeat Trump, a salesman Trump, a nothing-to-be-afraid-of Trump, a\nhappy-warrior Trump. Jared, Ivanka, and all their allies judged it a magnificent night,\nagreeing that finally, amid the pageantry—Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States\n—the president really did seem presidential. And for once, even the media agreed.\n\nThe hours following the president’s speech were Trump’s best time in the White\nHouse. It was, for at least one news cycle, a different presidency. For a moment, there was\neven something like a crisis of conscience among parts of the media: Had this president\nbeen grievously misread? Had the media, the biased media, missed well-intentioned\nDonald Trump? Was he finally showing his better nature? The president himself spent\nalmost two full days doing nothing but reviewing his good press. He had arrived, finally,\nat a balmy shore (with appreciative natives on the beach). What’s more, the success of the\nspeech confirmed the Jared and Ivanka strategy: look for common ground. It also\nconfirmed Ivanka’s understanding of her father: he just wanted to be loved. And, likewise,\nit confirmed Bannon’s worst fear: Trump, in his true heart, was a marshmallow.\n\nThe Trump on view the night of the joint session was not just a new Trump, but a\ndeclaration of a new West Wing brain trust (which Ivanka was making plans to formally\njoin in just a few weeks). Jared and Ivanka, with an assist from their Goldman Sachs\nadvisers, were changing the message, style, and themes of the White House. “Reaching\nout” was the new theme.\n\nBannon, hardly helping his cause, cast himself as a Cassandra to anyone who would\nlisten. He insisted that only disaster would come from trying to mollify your mortal\nenemies. You need to keep taking the fight to them; you’re fooling yourself if you believe\nthat compromise is possible. The virtue of Donald Trump—the virtue, anyway, of Donald\nTrump to Steve Bannon—was that the cosmopolitan elite was never going to accept him.\nHe was, after all, Donald Trump, however much you shined him up.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019995",
