  "text": "All beha vior is instructive. That is, we teach others how to treat us. The game of guilt, along with other\nControl Factor tools, teaches our Enemy it is winning and to continue playing.\n\nFP: The reason Nidal Hasan was able to perpetrate his murder spree at Fort Hood is precisely because of\nour Control Factor. Please connect the dots for our readers.\n\nSiegel: Just as I used to look at Hitler when I was young and be amazed that no one could see what he was\nabout, in retrospect the same applies to Hasan. It is precisely all the elements of the Control Factor that\ncould allow this man, a Soldier of Allah, to be positioned as he was. He was blatantly voicing his Islamist\nviews and Jihadi intent including, even, an essay recommending the “painful liquidation” of non-Muslims.\nYet, in the Army of all places, the Control Factor operated to allow and even foster his work. Even after the\nmurders, we cont inue the denial by calling it “workplace violence.” He is the Civilization-Violent Jihad\ncombo! And we continue to enable the same infiltration elsewhere.\n\nFP: Tell our readers about “The Project” and “Explanatory Memorandum.” These are realities that serve as\ngreat threats to the Control Factor, right?\n\nSiegel: These are separate sets of documents that outline the Muslim Brotherhood’s goals and\n\nplans underlying the Civilization Jihad. The former was discovered in Europe and extends globally. The\n1991 Explanatory Memorandum emerged in 2008 from the Holy Land Foundation trial and describes the\nBrotherhood’s work in America as a “Civilization-Jihadist Process with all the word means” and “a kind of\ngrand Jihad in eliminating and destroying the Western civilization from within and ‘sabotaging’ its\nmiserable house by their own hands and the hands of the believers so that it is eliminated and God’s religion\nis made victorious over all other religions.”\n\nMuch as the communists of the Soviet Union had formulated in the 1950s a detailed long term plan to\ndestroy America (many of the effects of which we are seeing of late including destroying the\n\nnuclear family, secularizing the nation, feminizing men ...) these documents identify many strategies to\ninfiltrate while eroding the foundations of our civilization in order to transform it into an Islamic one. The\nControl Factor has many ingenious ways to convince us that this is ridiculous, that our courts and system\nwould never allow such a thing, that one is racist or “Islamophobic,” if not insane, for even thinking this is\nreal. And just as with the communists, time is plentiful. Even more so with our Islamic Enemy, a multi-\ndecade plan is short term. It is not critical that a seriou sly engaged Muslim lives to see the result. It is\ncritical, more correctly a duty, however, that he carries on his Jihad. Patrick Poole and The Center for\nSecurity Policy’s Team B Report, Shariah: The Threat to America, are excellent sources for your readers to\npursue these documents.\n\nFP: And so what you call an “Inner Jihad” has to start. It’s our, as you say, mandatory “addiction\ntreatment.” Please explain.\n\nSiegel: The “Inner Jihad” is the effort we must undertake to gain control over our Control Factors. There is\na famous Hadith in which Mohammad, returning from a successful battle, essentially says that the physical\nfight was the “lesser Jihad” and it is time to then attend to the “greater Jihad €”- that internal battle against\nour own internal appetites, lusts, wrong thinking and so forth. While that Hadith has been falsely utilized to\nsay that “Jihad” is not violent, it is useful to us as a symbol of the vicious effort we must take internally\nagainst our own Control Factor tendencies.\n\nAs I said earlier, the Control Factor is “active” and “continuous” so we must constantly monitor and combat\nit. Like “Whack-a-Mole,” just as we may think we have addressed it, another variation pops right up. I use\nthe terms “addict” and “enabler” because we truly need a form of rehab to break the habitual power of the\nControl Factor and because our relationship with our Islamic Enemy is very much like that between a\ntypical addict and his enabler. And just as it is so difficult for an addict to kick his habit, so does the enabler\nact essentially addicted to his behavior and find it so difficult to change. At its core, the relati onship\ninvolves the transfer of responsibility for our Islamic Enemy’s hate and resultant actions onto us with our\nresponse framed essentially as an effort to do what we can to try to address the Enemy’s grievance. (Your\nbook, United in Hate, describes this addiction to hate in detail.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025034",
