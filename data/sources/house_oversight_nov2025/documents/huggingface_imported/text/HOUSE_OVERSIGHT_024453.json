  "text": "Education is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross\nnational income of $48 trillion.* In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1 trillion market.” Education\nis still predominantly provided by public / governmental eniities in most countries including the U.S. KUE\nbelieves that the industry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the\nevolution observed in the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and\ntelecommunications.\n\nThe Company's strategy is to grow its existing platforms both damestically and internationally and to\nexpand its assets globally across the pre-K-12 education continuum. In addition to its current investments\nin ECE and online curriculum, KUE will seek to expand by acquiring education companies offering\nservices or products that can complement its current offering. KUE believes that owning a diversified\nporticlio of assets in the pre-K-12 education space will allow it to leverage content and best practices\nacross multiple constituencies and to multiple markets. KUE’s strategy in U.S. ECE is to expand its\nexisting platform through the opening of new centers, opportunistic acquisitions of smaller competitors\nand the sale of education-related products and services through existing channels. Internationally, KUE\nhas identified several near-term opportunities fo expand into Europe, the Middle-East and Asia, with some\nof these opportunities in advanced stages of preparation.\n\nManagement has a history of successfully growing through acquisitions. In May 2003, KLC acquired\nAramark Educational Resources (\"AER\"), a company three times its size in terms of revenue.\nManagement completed the integration of AER in approximately 12 months, realizing approximately $10\nmillion in net annual synergies and improving operational performance. In January 2005, the Company\nacquired KinderCare, the largest provider of ECE services in the U.S. at the time. Management achieved\napproximately $25 million in net annualized synergies through the closing of under-performing centers\nand the rationalization cf corporate overhead. In November 2005, KLC separated its education\noperations (KLC OpCo) from its real estate assets (KLC PropCo}. Management believes this division\nallows KLC OpCo management fo focus on the core business of operating and growing the ECE\nbusiness while the maximization of the valuable educational real estate portfolio is managed and\nexpanded by a professional real estate firm, Greenstreet Real Estate Partners (formerly Greenstreet\nRealty Partners, L.P.}, and also represents management's view of KLC’s component businesses.\n\nManagement believes that KUE presents an attractive financial profile with its combination of businesses:\n{i} KLC OpCo, which generated $1.48 billion in pro forma revenue and $150 million in pro forma Adjusted\nEBITDA’ in 2005, is projected to grow organically to $2.3 billion and $320 million by 2011, respectively\nand to generate operating cash flow growing from $72 million in 2005 to $214 million in 2011; (i) a real\nestate portfolio in KLC PropCo that generated an additional $88 million in pro forma EBITDA in 2005; and\n(iii) an investment in k12, which continues to deliver top line growth in excess of 25% and has seen its\nrevenue grow at a 133% compounded annual growth rate over the last three fiscal years (from $6.7\nmillion in 2002 to $85.1 million in 2005).\n\n1.2.
