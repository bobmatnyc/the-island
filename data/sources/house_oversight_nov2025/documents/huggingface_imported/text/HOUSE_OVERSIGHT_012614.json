I will not miss my\nindictment date when this has dragged on for several weeks already and then, if things fail apart, be left in\na less advantageous position than before the negotiations. [ have had an 82-page pros memo and 53-page\nindictment sitting on the shelf since May to engage in these negotiations. There has to be an ending date,\nand that date is Monday.\n\nA.

Our most flexible West Palm Beach magistrate is on duty\non Monday, so, assuming we have signed documents by 1:30 or so, we should be able to get Mr.\nEpstein arraigned on Monday. I doubt that we will be able to get everything finished up here,\nget down to Miami, and try to find a Miami mag by close of business on Monday.\n\nA.
