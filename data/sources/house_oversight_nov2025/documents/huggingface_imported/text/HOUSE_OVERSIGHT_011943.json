  "text": "Jeffrey Epstein’s Level 3 sex offender status\nupheld by NY appeals court\n\nBy Dareh Gregorian\n\nNovember 18, 2011 | 5:00am\n\nMultimillionaire perv Jeffrey Epstein may not consider his Florida conviction for soliciting a\nminor a big deal, but New York does.\n\nA state appeals court yesterday upheld the financier’s status as a Level 3 sex offender —\nmeaning he’s considered “a threat to public safety” and a “high risk” to offend again.\n\nEpstein, 58, did 13 months in a Florida jai! for soliciting a minor to perform a sex act on him\nduring a “massage.”\n\nAlthough he was never indicted or convicted for hiring any other underage girls, the state\nAppellate Division found there was “clear and convincing evidence” he had indeed done so,\nmaking the Level 3 designation appropriate.\n\na2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011943",
