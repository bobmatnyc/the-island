  "text": "What makes this particular type of allegation so repugnant is that | get asked for literally thousands of selfies, and when people come\nup to me they are vulnerable, often shaking, and sometimes overly aggressive. | am particularly proud of the way | attempt to make all\npeople feel at ease, and respected, rather than humiliated. Thus, this false claim strikes at the heart of what | am about, which is to\nacknowledge fans in a way that makes them feel appreciated. As | understand you had a reporter watching me sign books and take\nselfies at the CFl conference in Las Vegas this year, that behavior is what they will have witnessed. Moreover, | am proud of the\ninteractions | have had at both Case and ASU, with students, colleagues and staff of all genders and ethnicities. | have worked hard\nto support them, mentor them, and treat them with respect. | treat others as responsible adults, and | expect to be treated equally.\n\nLawrence M.

If the purpose of your reporting is to somehow argue that that Universities and\nother institutions are lax in dealing with well known individuals like myself, then in fact the situation is quite the opposite. My high\npublic profile opens me up to more scrutiny at these institutions, not less, and it also opens me up to a host of outside complaints and\nallegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that | have remained a professor\nin all Universities with which | have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer or an invited speaker at organizations like\nCFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the fact that they trust my behavior. | was asked to be an honorary\ndirector of CFI, and invited to their last 3 meetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees\nuniversally appreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your report is\nto impugn my integrity or suggest | have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of your 'miscellaneous facts’, as a\nscientist | try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than allegations and innuendo. | also try and judge the facts\nin context. The fact that Universities and other organizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is\nbecause they value my contributions and my actions.\n\nYour specific allegations are false or distorted. Item 1 refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually\ndecided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. |\ncannot comment on item 3, which involves an anonymous 3rd party claim, because | know nothing about it, and it was not taken\nseriously enough to result in any university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because | decided | didn’t want to go out\nto a bar with a group of attendees that | was harassing them? The second part is false. | don’t do that. Re incident 5: The ‘female\ncompanion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is what | wrote in response to the blog in\nquestion, causing it to be taken down.\n\nIt is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,\n\nRe item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came to me or wrote to me\nwith questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation | DID tell her she was different than the other students in her\n\nyear. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school, but she was interested in science communication so | told her\nthat she might want to take a different path. Since she was the only woman in her year, as | recall, | did ask her on one of these\noccasions if that made it difficult for her in any way. | asked, because as a faculty member | was interested, and also because as\nsomeone she had asked for career advice from | wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. | have\ngone back over emails from that period. | have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which | usually had to turn down\nbecause | was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee with her off campus to talk, and | politely\ndeclined. | did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch me do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. |\ndid and do have coffee and meals with students on campus, and | see nothing wrong with this. | was shocked when | later learned of\nher complaint, not least because there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to\nhave been offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and at a AAAS conference in 2008, for which she\nhad asked, and for which | had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife and | gave her a lift well out out of our way to\ndrop her off at her hotel, and | note in an email response to her email about the conference, agin in 2008, | expressed that | would\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021427",
