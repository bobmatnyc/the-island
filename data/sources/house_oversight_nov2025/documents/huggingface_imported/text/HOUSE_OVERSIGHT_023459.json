For all the\nattention the Mideast protests have received, their most notable\nimpact on the region thus far hasn't been an upswell of democracy. It\nhas been a dramatic spike in tensions between two geopolitical titans,\nIran and Saudi Arabia.\n\nThis new Middle East cold war comes complete with its own spy-\nversus-spy intrigues, disinformation campaigns, shadowy proxy\nforces, supercharged state rhetoric—and very high stakes.\n\n\"The cold war is a reality,\" says one senior Saudi official. \"Iran is\nlooking to expand its influence.
