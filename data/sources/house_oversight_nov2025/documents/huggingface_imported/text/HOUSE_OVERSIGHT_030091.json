  "text": "32\n\nBaath (renaissance) party jointly founded by two intellectuals, Michel\nAflag and Salah al-Din Bitar, with an agenda explicitly aimed at\novercoming sectarian divisions.\n\nIt would be wrong to suppose that the Alawis deliberately sought to\nsubvert or take over the Baath or the armed forces. Their primary\nimpulse was their own security. After independence the Syrian\nparliament abolished the separate representation for minorities\ninstituted by the French, along with certain judicial rights. Nusayri\nsheikhs and notables encouraged young men to join the Baath\nbecause they believed its secular outlook would protect them from\nSunni hegemony and persecution. Other minorities, including\nChristians, Druzes, and Ismailis, tended to join the Baath (or in some\ncases the Communist Party and Syrian Socialist National Party) for\nsimilar reasons. The eventual dominance achieved by the Alawis may\nbe attributed to their highland military background and the default\nlogic by which ‘asabiyya tends to assert itself in the absence of other,\nmore durable structures.\n\nThe first three military coups that followed Syrian independence were\nengineered by Sunni officers. This was followed by the disastrous\nunion with Nasser’s Egypt in 1958 when Baath party leaders,\nfollowing their pan-Arabist nationalist logic, merged their country’s\nidentity into that of their more powerful Sunni neighbor. After Syria\nformally united with Egypt, Nusayri officers who had joined the\nBaath party became increasingly alarmed that Arab nationalism, for\nall its secular rhetoric, was really a veil concealing Arab Sunni\nsupremacy. They formed a clandestine military committee led by\nSalah Jadid, an Alawi, which took power in a military coup in 1963.\nHafez al-Assad, trained as a fighter pilot, became air force\ncommander. Some seven hundred officers were purged, and most of\ntheir positions were filled with Nusayris. A further coup against the\nBaathist old guard brought Assad into the cabinet as defense minister\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030091",
