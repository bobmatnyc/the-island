We expect growth of 1.4% in CY2017 and 1.2% in CY2018, well above consensus of just 0.8%\ngrowth next year. For the first time in four years both monetary and fiscal policy are supporting growth. The\ncombination of modestly higher commodity prices, a weaker yen, and a tightening output gap should drive\nJapan-style core inflation to 1.0% in CY2017, and 1.4% in CY2018. We expect the BoJ to keep its rate targets\nunchanged for the foreseeable future as inflation moves in the right direction.\n\nFiscal and monetary policy realigning\n\nFor years Japan has oscillated between loose and tight fiscal policy. Japanese policymakers now seem to be\non the same page and we see little risk of another policy error. If anything, we see upside risks from greater\nfiscal stimulus via a third supplementary budget or a relatively aggressive FY17 ordinary budget. Meanwhile,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014401",
