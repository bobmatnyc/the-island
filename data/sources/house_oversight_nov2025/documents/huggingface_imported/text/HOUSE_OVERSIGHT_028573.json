  "text": "Cite as: 586 U.S. (2019) 15\n\nBREYER, J., dissenting\n\na suit would lead to “disruptive interference” with the\norganization’s functions, the waiver does not apply. bid.\n\nOther organizations have attempted to solve the liabil-\nity/immunity problem by turning to multilateral, not\nsingle-nation, solutions. The UN, for instance, has\nagreed to “make provisions for appropriate modes of set-\ntlement of ... [d]isputes arising out of contracts or other\ndisputes of a private law character.” Convention on Privi-\nleges and Immunities of the United Nations, Art. VIII,\n§29, 21 U.S. T. 1488, T. I. A.S. No. 6900. It generally\ndoes so by agreeing to submit commercial disputes to\narbitration. See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations\nLaw of the United States §467, Reporters’ Note 7 (1987).\nOther organizations, including the IFC, have set up alter-\nnative accountability schemes to resolve disputes that\nmight otherwise end up in court. See World Bank, Inspec-\ntion Panel: About Us (deseribing World Bank’s three-\nmember “independent complaints mechanism” for those\n“who believe that they have been ... adversely affected by\na World Bank-funded project”), https://inspectionpanel.org/\nabout-us/about-inspection-panel (as last visited Feb. 25,\n2019); Compliance Advisor Ombudsman, How We Work:\nCAO Dispute Resolution (describing IFC and Multi-\nlateral Investment Guarantee Agency dispute-resolution\nprocess, the main objective of which is to help resolve issues\nraised about the “social and environmental impacts of\nIFC/MIGA projects”), www.cao-ombudsman.org/howwework/\nombudsman.\n\nThese alternatives may sometimes prove inadequate.\nAnd, if so, the Immunities Act itself offers a way for Amer-\nica’s Executive Branch to set aside an organization’s im-\nmunity and to allow a lawsuit to proceed in U.S. courts.\nThe Act grants to the President the authority to “with-\nhold,” to “withdraw,” to “condition,” or to “limit” any of the\nAct’s “immunities” in “light of the functions performed by\nany such international organization.” 22 U.S. C. §288.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028573",
