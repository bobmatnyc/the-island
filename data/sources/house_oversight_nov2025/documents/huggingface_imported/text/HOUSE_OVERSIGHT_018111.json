In this\nmodel the highest goal is regime survival, a notion that doesn’t\nnecessarily apply to the Iranian clerical regime. Clerics, even\nChristian ones from an earlier age, have been known to take their\notherworldly prerogatives seriously.\n\nAll we can say, then, is that the regime would not try to martyr itself,\nnor would it be passive. Most likely, Iran would seek to prolong and\nexpand the war, attrite U.S. forces and morale, and weaken the\nresolve of coalition members. Iran has the means, methods and allies\nwith which to respond in this fashion, and it has made clear that it\nwould use them.9\n\nImportant Iranian conventional war assets include short- and medium-\nrange missiles; strike aircraft; missile-equipped naval combatants and\nsmall boats; naval mine-laying capabilities; regular army and IRGC\nspecial forces; and air defense and coastal defense missiles.
