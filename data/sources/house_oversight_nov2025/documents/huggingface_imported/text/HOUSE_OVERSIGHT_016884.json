  "text": "superintelligence to recursively improve its superintelligence, from the instant it is turned\non we will be powerless to stop it.\n\nBut these scenarios are based on a confusion of intelligence with motivation—of\nbeliefs with desires, inferences with goals, the computation elucidated by Turing and the\ncontrol elucidated by Wiener. Even if we did invent superhumanly intelligent robots,\nwhy would they want to enslave their masters or take over the world? Intelligence is the\nability to deploy novel means to attain a goal. But the goals are extraneous to the\nintelligence: Being smart is not the same as wanting something. It just so happens that\nthe intelligence in Homo sapiens is a product of Darwinian natural selection, an\ninherently competitive process. In the brains of that species, reasoning comes bundled\nwith goals such as dominating rivals and amassing resources. But it’s a mistake to\nconfuse a circuit in the limbic brain of a certain species of primate with the very nature of\nintelligence. There is no law of complex systems that says that intelligent agents must\nturn into ruthless megalomaniacs.\n\nA second misconception is to think of intelligence as a boundless continuum of\npotency, a miraculous elixir with the power to solve any problem, attain any goal. The\nfallacy leads to nonsensical questions like when an AI will “exceed human-level\nintelligence,” and to the image of an “artificial general intelligence” (AGI) with God-like\nomniscience and omnipotence. Intelligence is a contraption of gadgets: software modules\nthat acquire, or are programmed with, knowledge of how to pursue various goals in\nvarious domains. People are equipped to find food, win friends and influence people,\ncharm prospective mates, bring up children, move around in the world, and pursue other\nhuman obsessions and pastimes. Computers may be programmed to take on some of\nthese problems (like recognizing faces), not to bother with others (like charming mates),\nand to take on still other problems that humans can’t solve (like simulating the climate or\nsorting millions of accounting records). The problems are different, and the kinds of\nknowledge needed to solve them are different.\n\nBut instead of acknowledging the centrality of knowledge to intelligence, the\ndystopian scenarios confuse an artificial general intelligence of the future with Laplace’s\ndemon, the mythical being that knows the location and momentum of every particle in\nthe universe and feeds them into equations for physical laws to calculate the state of\neverything at any time in the future. For many reasons, Laplace’s demon will never be\nimplemented in silicon. A real-life intelligent system has to acquire information about the\nmessy world of objects and people by engaging with it one domain at a time, the cycle\nbeing governed by the pace at which events unfold in the physical world. That’s one of\nthe reasons that understanding does not obey Moore’s Law: Knowledge is acquired by\nformulating explanations and testing them against reality, not by running an algorithm\nfaster and faster. Devouring the information on the Internet will not confer omniscience\neither: Big Data is still finite data, and the universe of knowledge is infinite.\n\nA third reason to be skeptical of a sudden AI takeover is that it takes too seriously\nthe inflationary phase in the AI hype cycle in which we are living today. Despite the\nprogress in machine learning, particularly multilayered artificial neural networks, current\nAI systems are nowhere near achieving general intelligence (if that concept is even\ncoherent). Instead, they are restricted to problems that consist of mapping well-defined\ninputs to well-defined outputs in domains where gargantuan training sets are available, in\nwhich the metric for success is immediate and precise, in which the environment doesn’t\n\n81\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016884",
