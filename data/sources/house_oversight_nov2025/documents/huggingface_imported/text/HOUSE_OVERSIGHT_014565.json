If US financial conditions\nhad stayed at those levels for over a year, US\nGDP growth would have slowed by about one\npercentage point, all else being equal. Financial\nconditions are the mechanism by which shocks\nfrom China would have the most immediate\n\nimpact on key developed economies such as the US.\n\nAs mentioned above, one of the triggers of\nUS recessions has been economic imbalances.\nWhile we do not see such imbalances in the US,\nor in other major developed economies, at this\ntime, we see significant imbalances in China. Such\nimbalances have led to crises in other countries,\nand there is no reason to believe that they will not\nlead to a financial crisis in China. In our view, it is\nnot a question of if—it is only a question of when.\n\nThe biggest imbalance in China is the high level\nof debt relative to GDP. The Bank for International\nSettlements (BIS) has a series of early warning\nindicators. One of the more widely followed\nand reliable measures is the credit-to-GDP gap,\nmeasured as the total credit extended to the\nprivate nonfinancial sector as a percentage of GDP\ncompared with its long-term trend. As shown in\nExhibit 27, China breached the high-risk threshold\nin June 2012, when its credit-to-GDP gap rose\nabove the 10% level. At 30.1% as of March\n2016 (latest data available) and rising, China’s\ngap exceeds the 10% threshold by 20 percentage\npoints, levels previously seen in Spain before the\nEuropean sovereign debt crisis. Major developed\nand emerging market countries have experienced a\nfinancial crisis within three years of their credit-to-\nGDP gap exceeding 10%.\n\nIn our 2016 Outlook and our 2016 Insight\nreport, Walled In: China’s Great Dilemma, we\nstated that we did not expect a hard landing in\nChina over the next two years—2016 and 2017.\nWe continue to assign a low probability to a hard\nlanding in China in 2017. However, it is unlikely\nthat China can avoid a financial crisis over the\nnext three years. In prior years, we have pointed to\nChina’s high savings rate and government control\nof many aspects of the economy as reasons for\nits ability to avert a hard landing. However, the\ncountry’s debt levels have risen rapidly, the pace\nof capital outflows has picked up, and net foreign\n\nExhibit 27: Credit-to-GDP Gap Across Economies\nChina’s gap reached the high-risk threshold in June 2012 and\nhas continued to rise.\n\nCredit-to-GDP Gap (% of GDP)\n50\n\n30\n\n30 High Risk UK\n\nElevated Risk Eurozone\n50 US —— Spain\nJapan China\n~————> Russia\n\n70\n1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010 2015\n\nData through Q1 2016.\n\nNote: Estimates based on series of total credit to the private nonfinancial sector.

Keep\nin mind that even the US was not able to avert a\nfinancial crisis after its credit-to-GDP gap briefly\nbreached the 10% high-risk threshold in December\n2006 and peaked at 12.4% in December 2007.\nThe US has the highest GDP per capita of any\nmajor country in the world. The large countries\nthat come closest to the US on this score have\nGDP per capita levels that stand at about 70% of\nUS levels on a nominal basis and slightly higher\non a purchasing power parity (PPP) basis. The US\ndollar is also the unquestioned reserve currency\nof the world; its reserve-currency status has only\nbeen fortified after the Eurozone sovereign debt\ncrisis and the British referendum for Brexit. Thus,\nthe US is able to access the excess savings of the\nentire world. The US also receives the largest share\nof world foreign direct investment flows, capturing\n14% of global flows between 2011 and 2015.\nThe US now accounts for 20% of the stock of all\nforeign direct investment. Yet, despite all these\nmajor advantages, it did not avert a financial crisis\nin 2008. It defies logic to assume that China will\nbe the one major country that avoids a financial\ncrisis and a hard landing when it does not enjoy\nsuch advantages.
