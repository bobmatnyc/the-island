But\nhe is better known in China asa spe-\ncialist who knows the country\ninside out.\n\nOver the past 29 years, he has\nvisited almost every provincial\nregion and spoken with people from\nall walks of life, including some who\nhave gone on to become State lead-\ners.\n\n“Tt’s been a great gift to my life to\nbe able to learn so much about Chi-\nna’s rich civilization, political theo-\nries and the whole development,” he\nsaid.\n\nKuhn, who is from the United\nStates, learns as an outsider but\ncommunicates as an insider. In his\ntalk show Closer to China with R.L.\nKuhn on the China Global Televi-\nsion Network, he presents China’s\ncomplex story to the world through\ncandid, intimate discussions with\nthe country’s decision-makers.\n\nIn a hotel suite in Wangfujing,\ndowntown Beijing, one busy lunch-\ntime last week, Kuhn shared his\nthoughts on Chinese politics with\nChina Daily, between exercising and\na meeting of the Communist Party\nof China, which he had been invited\nto attend as an observer.\n\nHe spoke passionately about the\n19th CPC National Congress, which\nwas held in Beijing in October,\ndescribing it as “a milestone con-\ngress that set the agenda for more\nthan 30 years”.\n\nThe Party proposed two new con-\ncepts at the congress — “a new era\nof socialism with Chinese charac-\nteristics” and Xi Jinping Thought\non Socialism with Chinese Charac-\nteristics for a New Era, which has\nbeen written into the Party Consti-\ntution.\n\n“To understand China today, it is\ncritical to appreciate what the new\nera means. ... I like to understand\nnew era in two categories: its char-\nacteristics at home and abroad, and\nits timeline,” Kuhn said.\n\nHe has obviously developed his\nown way of explaining terms with\nChinese characteristics. That is to\nbreak down the characteristics,\ndomestically and internationally,\nrather than delve into the term.\n\nHe listed a number of challenges\nin China’s new era, from pollution to\nmedical care, among which he said\nthe biggest is the rising expectations\nof the people at home, because “now\nthat the people have some, they\nwant more”.\n\nThe complex international envi-\nronment is the main characteristic\nof the new era, as the world is frag-\nmented by diverse problems and\nchallenges, he said.\n\nWhile explaining what he called\nthe timeline of the new era (2017,\n2021, 2049) and expounding his\nunderstanding of Xi Jinping\n\nI like to understand\n\nnew era in two catego-\nries: its characteristics\nat home and abroad,\nand its timeline.”\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn, investment\nbanker and anatomy researcher\n\nQ&A | ROBERT\nLAWRENCE KUHN\n\nYou hold multiple titles now.\nHow have you managed to\nmaster so many different\nfields? Do they have any-\nthing in common?\n\nThere's one word to describe\nthe commonality, that is “pas-\nsion” Whatever I’ve done I\nwant to have passion for it. To\nexpand that a bit, it’s the pas-\nsion to learn. 'm not here to\nteach, I love to learn. When I\nwrite a new book, it’s some-\nthing I want to learn about. I\nuse that vehicle to learn. So\npassion about learning is the\ncommon denominator. China\nhas given me a hugely rich life\nbecause of everything I’ve\nlearned here.\n\nThought on Socialism with Chinese\nCharacteristics for a New Era —\nwhich he broke down into three cat-\negories: serve the people, national\nrejuvenation, and governance mod-\nernization — Kuhn showcased his\nknowledge of the Party’s files, which\nhe has clearly learned by heart.\n\nHe recited almost every key\npoint of the 68-page report Xi\ndelivered to the congress in Octo-\nber. More important, he made con-\nnections between these points,\npresenting them in a vivid way, sea-\nsoned with personal experiences\nand thinking.\n\nWhen asked about the effects of\nthe anti-corruption campaign, he\nimmediately listed 10 objectives.\nThat's his style of approaching Chi-\nnese issues — divergent thinking\nand a vigilance not to lose sight of\nthe connections between different\n\npoints.\n\nFrom left:\n\noo .\n\nVISION CHINA -\n\nNew.Era, New Thinking =.\n\nRINT ATA\n\nhao Jianguo, head of the international communication bureau of the Publicity Department of the Communist Party of China Central Committee; Jiang\n\nQingzhe, Party chief of the University of International Business and Economics; China Daily reporter Andrew Moody; Guo Weimin, vice-minister of the Information\n\nOffice of the State Council; speakers Robert Lawrence Kuhn and Liu Xin; Zhou Shuchun, publisher and editor-in-chief of China Daily; and Zhang Jianmin, head of\ntranslation and interpretation for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, pose for a photo at the inaugural Vision China event on Monday at UIBE. FENG YONGBIN/ CHINA DAILY\n\nBritish journalist tells China’s story to the world\n\nBy LIUXUAN\nliuwuan@chinadaily.com.cn\n\nDespite living and working in Chi-\nna for a decade, Andrew Moody’s abil-\nity to speak Mandarin is still at a basic\nlevel. Yet that has not stopped the\naward-winning journalist from inter-\npreting China’s story for the world.\n\nMoody joined China Daily nine\nyears ago and is now a senior corre-\nspondent. He has written more than\n150 cover stories for the paper’s Euro-\npean Weekly and African Weekly,\nexamining a wide range of issues\nincluding the Belt and Road Initiative.\n\nThe job has provided him with first-\nhand experience of how China is\ndeveloping as well as the chance to\nrecord reactions from the outside\nworld, especially in the West, toward\nthe nation’s growth and changes.\n\nHe was at the Great Hall of the\nPeople to hear General Secretary\nXi Jinping deliver a report to the\n19th National Congress of the Com-\nmunist Party of China in October,\nwhen the concept of a “new era” was\nfirst mentioned.\n\n“The consensus of the various peo-\nple I spoke to in the hours after the\nspeech was that China's entering anew\nera could be a momentous turning\npoint in world history,’ Moody said.\n\nAccording to his interviews, he\nsaid, people believe that a more confi-\ndent China is striding into a world\nthat it also is helping to shape.\n\nMoody has his own understanding\nof the new era. With 40 years of\nreform and opening-up, he said China\nhas reached a point where it can move\non in many ways, such as in foreign\npolicy, global governance and domes-\n\nThe real fun of\n\nreporting in China is\nthe closeness to the\nactual story, the big\nfascinating story of\nChina merging into\nthe 21st century.”\n\nAndrew Moody,\nChina Daily senior reporter\n\nticreforms. “China has reached anew\njunction and has to move forward.”\n\nThe British journalist has written\nmany stories that explain China tothe\nrest of the world, and these have\nbrought him many honors, including\nbeing named a State High-End\nProject Foreign Expert.\n\n“J like reporting on China because\nit’s perhaps the 21st century’s most\nfascinating story,” he said. “The real\nfun of reporting in China is the close-\nness to the actual story, the big fasci-\n\nQ&A\nANDREW MOODY\n\nHow do you overcome the\nchallenges of showing the\nreal China to the world,\nespecially to those who have\nbiases against China?\n\nIt's a long-term thing, and\nyou cannot change this over-\nnight. There are negative per-\nceptions about China. It’s\nabout engagement. If China\nhas much more interactions\nwith the rest of the world, then\npeople will see China as it\nactually is. One of the 2035\nobjectives is to better increase\nChina’s soft power. Organiza-\ntions like China Daily can actu-\nally play a role in improving\nChina’s soft power. But I do\nthink it’s a long-term process,\nand China doesn’t need to be\ntoo sensitive toward criticism.\n\nnating story of China merging into\nthe 21st century, the stories that may-\nbe Western media don’t really have\nthe chance to interview.”\n\nMoody sees his task as communi-\ncating China to a global audience, and\nthere are still a number of things that\nneed to be done, he said.\n\n“I go back to the UK quite a lot, and\nI still don’t think that people are\naware of the impact of a much bigger\nChinese economy and China’s being a\nmore significant player in the world,”\nhesaid. “AllI can doisto reportand do\nstories one by one.”\n\nBroadcaster sees choice and confidence in rising nation\n\nBy YANG WANGLI\nyangwangli@chinadaily.com.cn\n\nFor 20 years, Liu Xin has had a sin-\ngular goal: to build a bridge of under-\nstanding between China and the\noutside world.\n\nThe television presenter began\nworking for China Central TV, the\nState broadcaster, in 1997, two years\nafter becoming the first Chinese to\ntake part in — and win — the Interna-\ntional Public Speaking Competition.\n\nEarly last year, her desire to share\nChina’s story received a major boost\nwhen she was chosen to host The\nPoint, a prime-time discussion show\nthat airs weekdays on the China Glob-\nal Television Network.\n\nShe said that China entering a new\nera means three things: opportunities,\nchallenges and responsibilities.\n\n“My winning speech in that 1995\nnational competition was about\nchoice,” she said. “After 15 years of\nreform and opening-up, we Chinese\nnow enjoy an abundance of choice in\nour daily lives”\n\nAfter listening to General Secretary\nXi Jinping’s report at the opening of\n\nthe 19th National Congress of the\nCommunist Party of China, Liu said\nshe was impressed with his use of the\nword “confidence”.\n\n“Tt’s the confidence China has devel-\noped through knowing that our sys-\ntem works. The confidence about who\nweare as a people, as a culture. And it’s\nthe confidence about our future role in\nthe world,” she said.\n\n“As media workers, we believe we\nhave a great story to tell. In the past,\npeople relied on a few correspondents\nor experts for information and opin-\nions on China. But more people are\ntuning in to Chinese media for infor-\nmation, both traditional platforms\nsuch as TV and online.”\n\nAs more questions emerge in the\nminds of those watching from outside\nChina, Liu said the opportunities to\ntell stories from inside the country are\ngrowing. However, so too are the chal-\nlenges.\n\n“Because of the ideological differen-\nces between China and the West, Chi-\nna has always been the subject of\n‘Western media criticism, which is\noften downright bashing based on\nfalsehoods,” she said.\n\nNow that China has defied all kinds\nof predictions of a collapse or econom-\nic hard landing, Western observers are\nhaving a hard time explaining the Chi-\nna phenomenon, she said, adding that\nthe result is an ignorance-based supe-\nriority complex mixed with bewilder-\nment and iced with jealousy.\n\nDuring her 30-minute program, Liu\nconducts live interviews with guests in\nthe studio or via satellite link to get a\nChinese perspective on two to three top-\nics that affect people around the world.\n\n“T understand the urgency to be\nmore assertive, but I believe we always\nneed to be aware of the danger of put-\nting feelings before reason, putting\nopinions before facts,” she said.\n“Nationalism is my biggest enemy.\n\n“President Xi has said we need to\nimprove the quality and effect of devel-\nopment. I believe this also applies to\nChina’s international communication.\nThe Chinese people will work hard\ntoward a community of ashared future,\nregardless of how others view us.”\n\nMeanwhile, Liu has a job to do. “Asa\njournalist, our duty is to tell China’s\nstory as it is, one topic at a time, one\nshow at a time,” she added.\n\nChina has always been\nthe subject of Western\nmedia criticism,\nwhich is often\ndownright bashing\nbased on falsehoods.”\n\nLiu Xin, host of The Point on\nChina Global Television Network\n\nQ&A | LIUXIN\n\nAs a professional journalist,\nwhat do you think China's\nmainstream media could do\nto better report China to the\noutside world in such a media\ntransformation age?\n\nIt’s challenging. I think we\nneed to be aware of new tech-\nnology. And the content is very\nimportant. If we’re more confi-\ndent, we can really be more\nsincere, be more at ease with\nour problems and our achieve-\nments. So let’s have a sincere\nconversation, not shy away\nfrom the problems we're fac-\ning. That’s why I say let’s tell\nthe China story as it is. It’s not\n100 percent about achieve-\nments. Every day we see mixed\nnews, we have mixed feelings,\nso let’s be factual, let’s be sin-\ncere and let people decide\nwhether they want to watch us\nor not. This is going to take\ntime, but I think if we follow\nthe right philosophy, the right\nsteps, we're going to make it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023682\n\nWhat they say\n\nVision Chi-\nnais the\nfirst high-\nend event\norganized\nby China\nDaily and\nUIBE after the two sides\nlaunched a partnership. By\ntelling China's stories in an\nobjective and rational manner,\nit aims to help students get to\nknow a real China and an\nobjective world, and to under-\nstand China in the new era.\nWang Jiaqiong, president of\nthe University of International\nBusiness and Economics\n\nI've learned\nalot from\nVision Chi-\nna today.\nWhat\nimpressed\nme most is\nhow to eliminate bias against\nChina when telling China's\nstories. The three experts\nshared a common opinion,\nwhich is to show a true China\nand not care too much about\ncomments from the outside\nworld. The sincerest story is\noften the most touching one.\nZhu Yue, a senior student\nmajoring in international poli-\ntics from Beijing International\nStudies University\n\nItwas an\ninteresting\nlecture. It\nwas good to\nunderstand\ncertain\naspects\nabout China. It would be good\nto have things like this abroad\nbecause it's about China. You\ndon’t have to explain China to\nthe Chinese people, but you\nneed to explain it to the out-\nside world.\n\nNektarios Palaskas, science\nand technology counselor for\nthe Swiss embassy\n\nThis event\nwas very\ninteresting.\nYou invited\ndistin-\nguished\nspeakers, is\nand all of them are of global\nthinking and have a vision\nabout China.
