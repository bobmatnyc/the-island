  "text": "4\n\nrebel Transitional National Council with “reconcilables” from the\nregime. Gaddafi himself would quit Tripoli and give up power, but\nthis would be an outcome of negotiations, rather than a precondition.\nState Department officials are skeptical, but they should test the\nemissary’s ability to deliver.\n\nThe Syrian case is also complicated by the blood-soaked history of\nthe regime. In a speech Monday, Assad proposed a national dialogue,\nin which the democratic opposition would select 100 participants to\nmeet with government representatives — and plan elections and a\nnew constitution. Given Assad’s disappointing record, it’s doubtful\nthat he can or will deliver. But it makes sense to test his offer — not\nleast because such a process would terrify Assad’s patrons in Iran. If\nthe dialogue fails, the Syrian demonstrations will be all the more\npotent, and Assad’s hold weaker.\n\nThese internal dialogues should be bolstered by regional support, as\nwith Afghanistan. The right shepherds for Libya are its newly\ndemocratic neighbors, Egypt and Tunisia, backed by France, Britain\nand Germany. In Syria, the obvious mediator-in-waiting is Turkish\nPrime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, backed by the Gulf countries.\nHere’s the point: The Arab Spring should not turn into a summer of\nblood, if there are diplomatic alternatives.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030159",
