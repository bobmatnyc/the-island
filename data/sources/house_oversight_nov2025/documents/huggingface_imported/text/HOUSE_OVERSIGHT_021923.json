And then that never happened and given the\nten-year pattern that -- I guess I should go back. I'm\nsorry. Let me correct my answer.\n\nWe should go back to December 30th, 2014, so\nthere -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period\nof time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer\nany questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,\nMr. Dershowitz said, oh, it's just a scheduling issue\nand we will get the Palm Beach Police Department to --\nto -- to, you know, to meet and learn all this.\n\nThe other thing that that I'm seeing here, so\nnow there's -- there's -- Mr. Dershowitz had been\ninvolved in concealing Mr. Epstein from the Palm Beach\nPolice Department, but there were others that had done\n\nsimilar sorts of things.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021923",
