  "text": "because there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation. Humans are a\nhardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given population die.\n\nI suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate\nchange itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I\nmight be wrong.\n\ntoo many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense\nis the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why not earilier. if\nthe brain discards unused neurons , why shold socieity keep their equivalent\n\nThe radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized organism\nis fascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if someone could\npull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a virus that\neverybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very uncomfortable (I visited\nKZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans inoculated ourselves very\nthoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider it.\n\nI rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series \"The Man in the High Castle\", which explores\nwhat would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as a\nbrutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not a\nflat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book \"Starship Troopers\" explores fascism, too,\nbut unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order.\n\nI find your \"political incorrectness\" very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly signaling,\nbut now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in your youth?\nDid you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person you want to\ntransform into.\n\nIt was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything\nremotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether \"democracy still\nworks\", and mostly expressed their disagreement with Trump. Ideology is like halitosis: easy to see in others,\nhard in oneself. A speaker felt that the media \"stifle all criticism of Trump\", another wanted to remove \"men\nand Elon Musk from government\", and everybody strongly agreed that we need more diversity everywhere.\n\nI noticed some time ago that Joi has remarkable public communication skills. He picks controversial, insight-\nladen topics, but sanitizes them by carefully replacing the parts of content that would divide his audience with\nsymbolic messages that everybody can fill with their own content in a way that resonates with them. The non-\ncontroversial parts will still be insightful. He manages to come across as very subversive, while rarely\noffending anyone (except the hard scientists, that miss hard substance).\n\nHe also asks influential people and smart students or faculty to write parts of his essays and speeches for him.\nThis invests them in his success, especially because he is going to reward and acknowledge them. Very few of\nhis ideas are original, instead he is good at identifying and testing thoughts he reads or hears from others.\n\nI am still beset by the ruinous instinct that the goal of communication ought to be mutual understanding. Joi is\nright. Public communication is about reaching one's goals.\n\nBests,\n\nJoscha\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025956",
