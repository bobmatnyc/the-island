We set the news agenda for the BBC and in many respects \nwe set the daily news agenda for the country. Our interviews are regularly re broadcast across the BBC's national and international news \nnetwork including - BBC World, BBC World Service and BBC Online. The combination of these outlets means the global 'reach' of a \nBBC Today programme interview is second to none. \nProgramme guests have included a selection of some of the biggest names in politics, business, international relations and the arts \nincluding US Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner, President Nicholas Sarkozy, President Hamid Karzai, HRH the Prince of Wales, former \nPresident Musharraf, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, former President Bill Clinton, Senator George Mitchell, Al Gore, Kofi \nAnnan, former Prime Minister Tony Blair, the Dalai Lama, Bill Gates, George Soros, Stephen Hawking, Sir Paul McCartney, Mick Jaggar \nand Salman Rushdie. \nWe are a programme that carries considerable weight and influence and which prides itself in being a first port of call for many of the \nmost important and influential figures on the international stage. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030456 \nI can best be reached via my cell phone - \nMy very best wishes and my thanks! \nKirsty \nKirsty MacKenzie, \nInterviews Editor, \nToday Programme, \nBBC News \nmobile: \n- or this email address. \n1111E4 111:::11 \n_ D AY V.414‘days 6-9am and Satsrdaya 7-9am \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk  \nThis e-mail (and any attachments) is confidential and may contain personal views which are not the views of \nthe BBC unless specifically stated. \nIf you have received it in error, please delete it from your system. \nDo not use, copy or disclose the information in any way nor act in reliance on it and notify the sender \nimmediately. \nPlease note that the BBC monitors e-mails sent or received. \nFurther communication will signify your consent to this. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
