  "text": "Current neurochemical research using molecular biological tools such as\nmice knockouts (the ablation of specific proteins though interference with their\nnucleotide-mediated protein biosynthesis), for example, the production of animals\nmissing a subunit of their hippocampal glutamate receptors associated with the loss\nof some memory functions, conclude the memorial mechanism to be a specific\ncellular region, such as hippocampal CA3 cells. Technology advances but continues\nto support a primitive philosophic animism of named brain parts which pop science\nicons like the late Francis Crick called “The Amazing Hypothesis.” He and his fellow\nbrain philosophers implicate brain mechanisms such as the amygdaloidal nucleus\nman who can emotionally color even affectually neutral information that is\ntransported through him. Imaging data showing amygdala man lighting up is used to\ntell us that circulating sensory information through the differentially behaving\namygdaloid nucleus is used for fight or flight interpretive significance. Emotionally\nexpressive human faces light up inferior parietal cortex. The lowa University\nProfessors, the husband and wife Damasios, have located even the criminal\npsychopath man in specific locations in the brain. As we have argued, perhaps ad\nnausem, using multimillion-dollar imaging and molecular biological technology and\nno new thoughts that weren’t around during the era of the 19th Century’s\nneuroanatomists, specific brain regions continue to gain implicative properties like\nthe task-specialized gods of the Roman and Greek pantheons. Crick implied that\n\nGod is a brain part.\n\nAt the same time, those of us that have been in the brain business for a\nwhile, recall skyscraper window washers, standing steady, high up on rope lashed\nplanks, suffering from congenital absence of the cerebellum, the supposed sine qua\nnon brain part supporting motor coordination and balance in humans. More\ngenerally, there is much evidence that if young enough and willing to work, many of\nthe functions of missing parts of the brain can be taken on remarkably well by other\nbrain parts thought not to be involved in these functions at all. In addition, since\nevidence of neuronal responding to loud noise or bright light perturbation can be\nfound almost everywhere in the hyper-connected human brain, because anticipation\n\nand brain time inversions make before and after indicate little about human\n\n101\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013601",
