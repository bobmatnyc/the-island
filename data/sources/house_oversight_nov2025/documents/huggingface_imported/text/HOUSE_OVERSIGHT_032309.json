She could acknowledge that she\nunderstands that people want change, and ask for a clear majority in the senate thinking abou that instead of\npresidential elections. Then if she does bad in 4 years she is out, but she could make the public understand\nthat senate is key to show what a president can do.\n\nBut again, I know 0.001% of what you or them understands about politics, I am however worried that europe\nis just 5 or 10 years ahead on this trend compared to the US in anti-establishment feelings and I have seen\nwith friends how irrational and influenceable masses can become in voting when they are frustrated (Hitler\nwas elected after all...)\n\nHope to see you soon!!!\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
