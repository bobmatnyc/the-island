The\nrebound in oil prices was a key contributor, as oil\nfinished the year with a staggering 52% spot price\ngain—an outcome made all the more remarkable\nby the fact that oil was down 25% at its worst\npoint early last year. This strength was not limited\nto the oil patch, as industrial metals rallied 17%\non average and precious metals advanced 8% (see\nExhibit 93).\n\nDespite last year’s broad-based gains, we are\nmore circumspect about the outlook for 2017.\nWhile we expect oil to advance, it begins the\nyear closer to the midpoint of our target range,\n\nExhibit 93: Commodity Returns in 2016\n\nproviding a more balanced risk/reward profile.\nMeanwhile, we believe the key elements of\nour macroeconomic forecast—Federal Reserve\ntightening, rising interest rates, modest US dollar\ngains and average inflation—represent continued\nheadwinds to gold prices. Comparable headwinds\nexist for industrial metals and agricultural goods,\ngiven the continued slowdown we expect in\nChinese growth.\n\nWe discuss the specifics of our outlook for oil\nand gold in the sections that follow.\n\nOil: Regaining Its Balance\n\nOil is finding its footing again after having\nstumbled dramatically over the last two years.\nWhile the market is still awash in oil inventories,\nthe sizable reductions in capital expenditures by\nthe largest international oil and gas companies\n\nMost commodity subcomponents saw positive returns in 2016, reversing several years of declines.\n\nS&P GSCI Energy Agriculture Industrial Metals Precious Metals Livestock\nSpot Price Average, 2016 vs. 2015 -10% -14% 0% 6% 8% 17%\nSpot Price Return 28% 48% 3% 19% 9% 10%\nExcess Return* 11% 18% 5% 17% 8% 8%\n\nData as of December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n\n* Excess return corresponds to the actual return from being invested in the front-month contract and differs from spot price return, depending on the shape of the forward curve. An upward-sloping\ncurve (contango) is negative for returns, while a downward-sloping curve (backwardation) is positive.\n\n74 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014607",
