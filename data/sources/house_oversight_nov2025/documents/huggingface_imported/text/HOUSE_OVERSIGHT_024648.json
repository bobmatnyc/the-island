However, this guidance does not provide\nfinancial institutions with a legal defense for any violation of federal law. Consequently, financial insti-\ntutions willing to serve the cannabis industry tend to be smaller institutions, such as credit unions and\nstate-chartered banks. “Big” banks generally do not serve, or are not willing to state publicly that they\nserve, the cannabis industry. For example, according to American Banker, a spokeswoman for Wells\nFargo Bank recently said the bank’s policy worldwide is to not bank marijuana businesses.\n\nHowever, as cannabis-related companies increasingly participate in the formal U.S. economy, the\nnotion of what constitutes a “marijuana-related business” is being blurred, and banks are finding it\nmore difficult to institute and follow their own policies.

According to public filings, Constellation Brands has credit agreements with a\nnumber of large financial institutions, including Bank of America, Bank of the West, Fifth Third Bank,\nGoldman Sachs Bank, JPMorgan Chase Bank, PNC Bank, SunTrust Bank and Wells Fargo Bank. How\nthese institutions respond to the investment by Constellation Brands and other similar transactions\nmay indicate how large financial institutions will interact with the industry in the foreseeable future.\n\nIn the current environment, we believe more financial institutions will start to provide some level of\nservice to the cannabis industry. We also agree with the view of the California State Treasurer's Office,\nas expressed in the working group’s report, that it is only a matter of time until cannabis businesses\nhave normal access to banking services.
