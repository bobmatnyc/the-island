Volatility & correlation suit well for outperformance\n\nCheapen long XLF upside to near 8y lows via selling upside on structurally challenged European\nbanks & relatively more bearish outlook for US rates vs EU\n\nUSDJPY and NKY the biggest beneficiaries of a Trump win\n\nBanks and Insurance are the most leveraged sector\n\nBanks and Insurance are the most leveraged sector\n\nChina risk premium rising but A-shares vol still at all-time lows\n\nOwn contrarian EM upside at low cost & limited risk\n\nQE uncertainty and USDJPY vol support NKY vs SPX realized vol\n\nWhat if QE hits its limit? Long NKY vol outright which is cheap to carry\n\nWith fiscal stimulus and potential tax cuts, small caps revert to old normal generating higher vol\non upside and downside relative to large caps\n\nVol and price technicals are attractive.

The 10 names\nare: Barclays, Aviva, Prudential, BT, Glencore, Tesco, CRH, BA, Standard Chartered & HSBC.\n\nHedge portfolios against a buy-the-dip failure should a faster rate cycle ultimately jeopardize it\n\nhe MSCI inclusion theme; Hedge with 2823 HK Jun17 95% put\n\nMarket may trade on the MSCI inclusion theme; Hedge with 2823 HK Jun17 95% put\nHistorically attractive to own TOPIX Top 10 corridor gamma weighted volatility dispersion\nHedge a rollover in China GDP and screen for cyclicals that could face pressure\n\nHedge a rollover in China GDP and screen for cyclicals that could face pressure\n\nBenefit from low vol, flat correl, likely hawkish ECB & (FX un-hedged) inflows into EU equities\nLeverage inexpensive equity vs. FX vols to own cheap tail protection\n\nBuy inexpensive EM equity puts on near-record performance gap to commodities\n\nMonetise low vol & high implied correl to position for greater sector dispersion in EU: long basket\ncall, short worst-of call\n\nOwn inexpensive NKY hedges into FOMC; Term structure is too steep is under-pricing risks\nBuy out-of-favour and inexpensive biotech upside by levering depressed vol & skew\n\nMarket may trade on\n\nBuy EEM puts financed by a basket of EM puts to lever near record low correl\n\nHedge a potential China tech bubble; Tencent potentially volatile after a 45% rally YTD\n\nHedge the upside into MSCI announcement on 20-Jun\n\nFundamental case to be long EU equities remains intact but stretched bullish positioning could\nlead to near-term consolidation\nBofAML Equity & Credit strategists highlight they favour equities over HY credit as div yields have\nsurpassed HY credit yield & equities o\n\ner more gearing to rising PMI's, earnings and FCF\n\nBankof America\nMerrill Lynch\n\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017 21\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014992",
