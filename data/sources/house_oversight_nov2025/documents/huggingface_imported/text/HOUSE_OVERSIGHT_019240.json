  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\ncommon ideologies, whether faith in Marxist revolution\nor ultraconservative, anticommunist reaction.\n\nAs the 20th century drew to a close, the weaknesses\nof both communist systems and traditional dictator-\nships became increasingly apparent. Front and center\nwas the growing economic gap between countries\nthat had opted for market economies and regimes\nthat were committed to statist economies.\n\nThe political and economic barriers that had long shel-\ntered the old dictatorships were soon swept away, and\nthose that survived or recovered did so by making a\n\nseries of strategic concessions to the new global order.\n\nodern authoritarianism has a different set of defin-\n\ning features:\n\n¢ Anillusion of pluralism that masks state control\nover key political institutions, with co-opted or\notherwise defanged opposition parties allowed\nto participate in regular elections\n\n¢ State or oligarchic control over key elements of\nthe national economy, which is otherwise open\nto the global economy and private investment,\nto ensure loyalty to the regime and bolster\nregime claims of legitimacy based on economic\nprosperity\n\n¢ State or oligarchic control over information on\ncertain political subjects and key sectors of the\nmedia, which are otherwise pluralistic, with high\nproduction values and entertaining content; in-\ndependent outlets survive with small audiences\nand little influence\n\n¢ Suppression of nongovernmental organizations\n(NGOs) that are focused on human rights or\npolitical reform, but state tolerance or support\nfor progovernment or apolitical groups that work\non public health, education, and other develop-\nment issues\n\n¢ Legalized political repression, with targets pun-\nished through vaguely worded laws and political-\nly obedient courts\n\n¢ Limited, selective, and typically hidden use of\nextralegal force or violence, with a concentration\non political dissidents, critical journalists, and\nofficials who have fallen from favor\n\n¢ Opportunistic, non-ideological cooperation with\n\nfellow authoritarian states against pressure\nfor democratic reform or leadership changes,\ninternational human rights norms and mech-\nanisms, and international security or justice\ninterventions\n\n¢ Knowledge-sharing with or emulation of fellow\nauthoritarian states regarding tactics and legis-\nlation to enhance domestic control\n\nChina and Russia\nThe two major modern authoritarian powers are China\nand Russia.\n\nUntil fairly recently, the conventional wisdom was that\nChina's one-party authoritarian system would gradual-\nly relax as the middle class expanded and the country\nbecame fully integrated into the global economic\n\nand diplomatic systems. The leadership did expand\ncitizens’ freedom to travel, make money, and access\ninformation and entertainment that did not touch on\nsensitive subjects. But it has resolutely refused to give\nup control over the political sphere.\n\nIn fact, the state has become increasingly aggressive\nin its suppression of political dissent and information\nthat might challenge the Communist Party narrative.\nThe regime's rhetoric and policies have become more\nhostile to democracy and “Western” values. Its propa-\nganda asserts the superior efficiency of the one-party\nsystem and sneers at the messiness of democracy.\nAnd the focus of its repressive apparatus has steadily\nexpanded from a relatively narrow segment of political\nopposition figures to encompass a broad collection of\ntarget groups, including human rights lawyers, ethnic\nminorities, Christians, women’s rights advocates, liber-\nal academics, and independent journalists.\n\nRussia is much smaller than China in terms of pop-\nulation and economic might, but it has emerged as\na leader of modern authoritarian innovation. Under\nVladimir Putin, the Russian regime pioneered the\ncapture of the media through state enterprises and\noligarchic cronies, the adoption of laws designed to\ndismember civil society, the use of the judiciary as\nan instrument of political harassment, and, perhaps\nmost importantly of all, the development of modern\npropaganda and disinformation.\n\nRussia has also been in the vanguard of a relentless\ncampaign against liberal values, and has moved\nrelentlessly to export authoritarian ideas and tech-\nniques to other societies, both in neighboring\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019240",
