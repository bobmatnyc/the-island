  "text": "believe that the threat is under our control, when in fact it is not. Kindly enlighten us as to these profound\ninsights you make in terms of the Control Factor.\n\nSiegel: First, let’s distinguish the ”real world” where real battles are taking place from the mental battlefield\nwhich occurs in each of our minds. We tend to believe our perceptions are simply clear realizations of what\nis “out there” and overlook how much our internal worlds can literally determine what we see. When our\ninternal minds become anxious and sense a loss of “control,” they tend to concoct ways to distort our\nperceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an “active and\ncontinuous process” designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our\nthinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening\nprospects, the mind is geared to actively distort.\n\nSimilarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly.\nIn turn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and\nthus seemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy\nMcCarthy entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer\nthan we are aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they\nmust out maneuver our conscious thinking.\n\nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of\nAmerica’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of\nhand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons,\nhave had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is\ninteresting on this point).\n\nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a\nfilm, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience\nknow there is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate\nCincinnati etc. This threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters.\nMuch of the initial exposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat\nbrings about, then explain it in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely\nterrifying is happening. The next stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr\nom trying to negotiate with it, to appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth.\nMost of these failings are due to not adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting\nonto it a host of other attributes instead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall\ndecision by whichever characters remain alive. I named this the “turnaround moment” when the character\nbecomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival.\nUltimately, the storyline is a race for whichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever\nadvantages they may still have to beat the threat.\n\nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to\ndeny that which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up\nwhile we still have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.\n\nI said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid\nwhere on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of\nmaneuvers the many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial,\ndemonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth.\nLayered upon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish\nto see in them or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These\nmaneuvers involve a mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the\nenemy is. Projection and introjection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to\nask how what the enemy accuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt\nand Shame, our need to be liked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger\nfantasies.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025030",
