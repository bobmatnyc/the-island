  "text": "Like so much about our world, rapid, widespread connectivity of the last decade has\nsharpened these dangers. Connection changes the nature of an object; it can make it\nmuch more vulnerable. It can make the harmless dangerous. Generally, once a\nmachine was jacked into a network, all sorts of fresh possibilities for mischief\nflowed right along with the data. The move from a lone PC on your desk to a really\nconnected machine represented the difference between living in a small town and\nwalking the streets of New York City. In one place you'd have few encounters,\nmostly familiar and harmless. In the other, you'd face an endless stream of the\nstrange, the new and the unexpected. This is what life is like every day for your\nphone or your bank or military - a world of ceaseless assault, often from never-seen\nweapons. Robert Morris Sr., a cryptographic and security genius who towered over\nNSA code breaking programs for decades in the last century, compressed his\nlifetime of experience cracking machines into “Three Golden Rules of Computer\nSecurity”:13\n\nRule One: Do not own a computer.\nRule Two: Do not power it on.\nRule Three: Do not use it.\n\nHe could have added a Fourth Rule: Do not connect it to anything.\n\nOf course, as we look around today, we're furiously, enthusiastically violating all\nfour of these rules pretty much every moment. In fact, our whole economic and\nsocial dreamscape depends on breaking them. We want the best device, we want it\nalways on, we want to use it all the time. Utility and connection are almost\nsynonyms now. That the Warez Dudes, or their 21't century brethren, are hungry to\nexploit these systems offers us a chance to understand even more deeply just how\npower works in this network age. Why are they so desperate to get inside? How\nexactly do they do it? We’ve seen so far two important properties of life in the\nnetwork age. First, the way in which network power exists on a sort of new surface\nof connected devices and cores, tied by strong data links that are slowly ripping\npower out of old institutions. Think of my Dad’s role as a doctor or the sharing\neconomy shocks delivered by connected cars and bedrooms and labor, for instance.\nSecond, we've seen how networks are complex adaptive systems, where emergent\nfeatures -billion dollar businesses, terror organizations, drones - appear with an\neasy, destructive frequency that is wiping out old leaders and replacing them with\nnew ones that better fit the demands of a connected age. Looking at the network\nworld and seeing that mesh, seeing the emergence of fit new species and the\nimpending extinction of others is the initial, essential part of the Seventh Sense.\n\nLingering deep inside the systems themselves, there is another lesson, however.\nAnd, not surprisingly, it is most alive in the hackers. “Exploit engineers,” a team led\nby researcher Sergei Bratus has argued, “show you the unintended limits of your\n\n133 Bob Morris cite to come\n\n97\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018329",
