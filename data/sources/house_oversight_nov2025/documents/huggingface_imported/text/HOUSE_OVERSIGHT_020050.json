  "text": "Hyper-by-the-book Rod Rosenstein—heretofore the quintessential apolitical player—\nimmediately became, in Washington eyes, a hopeless Trump tool. But Rosenstein’s\nrevenge was deft, swift, overwhelming, and (of course) by the book.\n\nGiven the decision of the attorney general to recuse himself from the Russia\ninvestigation, it fell under the authority of the deputy attorney general to determine\nwhether a conflict existed—that is, whether the deputy attorney general, because of self-\ninterest, might not be able to act objectively—and if, in his sole discretion, he judged a\nconflict to exist, to appoint an outside special counsel with wide powers and\nresponsibilities to conduct an investigation and, potentially, a prosecution.\n\nOn May 17, twelve days after FBI director Comey was fired, without consulting the\nWhite House or the attorney general, Rosenstein appointed former FBI director Robert\nMueller to oversee the investigation of Trump’s, his campaign’s, and his staff’s ties to\nRussia. If Michael Flynn had recently become the most powerful man in Washington for\nwhat he might reveal about the president, now Mueller arguably assumed that position\nbecause he had the power to make Flynn, and all other assorted Trump cronies and\nflunkies, squeal.\n\nRosenstein, of course, perhaps with some satisfaction, understood that he had delivered\nwhat could be a mortal blow to the Trump presidency.\n\nBannon, shaking his head in wonder about Trump, commented drily: “He doesn’t\nnecessarily see what’s coming.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020050",
