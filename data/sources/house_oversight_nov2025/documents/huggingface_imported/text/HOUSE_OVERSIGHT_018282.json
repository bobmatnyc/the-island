  "text": "So we should say it coldly: We have, as of yet, no strategy. We have no shared\npicture of the world as it might be. You. Me. Our leaders. None of us. And the\nexperience of other, fast-collapsed empires should way on us. “The struggle to\nsurvive,” the historian John Darwin has written of the British Empire, “was waged in\nan age of revolution: a Eurasian revolution that cumulatively (but very quickly)\ndestroyed almost all the global preconditions on which the British system had\ndepended since the 1830s.” So in our age. Many of the essential determinants of\nAmerican power are being revolutionized by new, connected forces. The world syste\nwill change in coming years. Our only question is will the changes reduce us as they\nonce shrunk Britain, or will we draw on them to establish a longer, more durable\nsystem. At the moment, in a time of fascinating explosions of ideas and insights and\nconnection, the American foreign policy approach is deeply and strangely unplugged\nfrom these risks and possibilities. The world has changed - is changing profoundly -\nfrom the one in which most students and practitioners of international affairs were\neducated. And here’s the reality: Nothing can stop this change. The last two decades\nhave brought massive and persuasive change in so many disciplines. And in foreign\npolicy? In the consideration of problems of war and peace which, if not handled\nproperly will rain tragedy on every other effort we might have in mind? Not much\nhas changed. Except this: A growing sentiment of pessimism that suggests maybe\nAmerica can’t hold on. Great powers get one century to rule, the logic goes, and\nAmerica’s is now up.\n\nIt’s not merely that we lack a “China Strategy” or a “Middle East Strategy”, it’s that\nwe've failed to discern an overall grand strategy that would produce a coherent\nanswer to the question of what to do about China or the Middle East - to say nothing\nof how those forces might be played off another with clever diplomatic harmony like\ninstruments in a symphony. It is hard to know if this puzzlement represents a failure\nof imagination or of nerve. Does it mark arrogance or confusion? Or just an\nignorance of the profound, revolutionary nature of the forces now at work?\n\nToday when leading officials remark that their main concern is a rising China or\nrevanchist Russia or that we live in a world where, as Secretary of State John Kerry\nsaid, “terrorism is the principal challenge,” they are missing the point. The\nfundamental threat to American interests isn’t China or Al Qaeda or Iran. It is the\nevolution of the network itself. Constructed of switches, chips, data, code, exploits,\nsensors, AI bots, financial instruments, trade, currency and more, the network is\nitself a weapons system. Its architecture, a wonderfully humming maze of change\nand contagion and instability, determines its terrifying dangers and marks its vast\nopportunities®. It touches - decisively - each and any particular problem we would\ncare to name.\n\n64 “The struggle to survive”: John Darwin, The Empire Project, (Cambridge:\nCambridge University Press, 2009) 477\n\n65 Its architecture: For an excellent overview on the politics of contagion, see Tony\nD.
