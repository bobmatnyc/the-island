Trained in\nphilosophy and mathematics at Pomona College\nand in statistics at Stanford University, his\ninterests mclude the nature of argument and\nevidence, particularly in the context of health,\ndisease, and medical treatment. He has\npublished articles on topics ranging from\ntreatment for back pain to computational\nmathematics, and from social determinants of\nhealth to the size of Shakespeare’s vocabulary.\nHe is a Fellow of the American Statistical\nAssociation, and a Fellow of the American\nAcademy for the Advancement of Science.\n\nThe question of how we come to\nknow—or to claim that we know—things, is left\nunexamined all too often. The similarities and\ndifferences in modes of argument across\ndisciplines, and the variations in what counts for\nevidence supporting or refuting a position within\nand across disciplines can be illuminating.\nStatistics, and statistical argument, provide a rich\nframework for thinking about such issues as\nmeasurement, learning, uncertainty, variation,\nand experiment. Statistical principles provide a\nframework for disciplined investigation, for\ncommunication about the extent of and\nlimitations to the information at hand, and for\ncombining information from different sources.\nAlthough there is enormous variability between\nindividuals, there are also commonalities to their\nexperience that transcend their differences. As a\nspecies and as individuals, we rely on these\ncommon threads, even when they are invisible to\nus.\n\nPage |147\n\non-going conversation that we have\ncome to recognize as being centered on\nunseen forces that shape, and are shaped\nby, the social nature of human beings.\nThe essays that make up this volume\ngive a hint as to what our conversation\nhas been like, but the linear structure that\na book imposes cannot fully evoke the\ngive and take of vigorous debate, the\nexcitement of viewing an old problem\nfrom a new perspective, or the\nsatisfaction that comes from sharing the\nsearch for knowledge — even when we\ndid not agree on the interpretation of\nwhat we discovered in our search.\n\nWe deliberately chose to describe\nour membership as a network rather than\na committee, or seminar, or task force, or\nclub, or salon. A network is defined as\nmuch by the connections between people\nas it is by the individual people\nthemselves. Networks can be described\npictorially as nodes (points that represent\nindividuals), some of which are\nconnected by edges (lines that represent\nlinks between two individuals). In our\nnetwork, we have focused on the value\nof the edges, and have held the\nconviction that much is to be gained by\nexploring previously untested\nconnections. We started with a set of\nnodes having only a handful of edges,\nand we ended with many more edges\nthan nodes.\n\nAs aresult, our network — and\neach individual in the network — has\nbeen enriched as we have learned more\nabout, and more from, perspectives that\ninitially were unfamiliar to each of us,\nthe end result being that our whole is\ndecidedly greater than the sum of our\nparts. This illustrates a recurrent theme\nin the book, that of emergent\nphenomena—characteristics that can be\nascribed to entities at a higher level of\norganization that, without conscious\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021393",
