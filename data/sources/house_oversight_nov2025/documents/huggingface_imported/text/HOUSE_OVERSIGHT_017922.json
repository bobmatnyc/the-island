Fed. 2d 789\n\npurposefully directed his activities toward the United\nStates by making personal contributions to several\nSaudi-based charities. (Federal Compl. §§ 442-43.)\n\n19! Plaintiffs must make a prima facie showing that Prince\nSalman and Prince Naif have minimum contacts with the\nUnited States. The minimum contacts requirement is\nsatisfied “if the defendant has ‘purposefully directed’ his\nactivities at the residents of the forum.” Burger King v.\nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 474, 105 S.Ct. 2174, 85\nL.Ed.2d 528 (1985). Foreseeability is not enough, there\nmust be “some act by which the defendant purposefully\navails itself of the privilege of conducting activities within\nthe forum.” Jd Donating money to established\nhumanitarian organizations that may or may not have\nbeen diverting funds to support al Qaeda cannot be\nconsidered primary participation in intentional\nwrongdoing expressly aimed at the United States.\nTerrorist Attacks I, 349 F.Supp.2d at 809 (citing In re\nMagnetic Audiotape Antitrust Litig., 334 F.3d 204, 208\n(2d Cir.2003)).\n\nAs to Prince Salman’s various limited contacts with the\nUnited States, they do not support general jurisdiction\nover him. The 1989 visit to the White House and\nMaryland is too far removed in time from the 2001\nattacks. See, e.g., Metro. Life Ins. Co., 84 F.3d at 569\n(explaining that a defendant’s “continuous and\nsystematic” contacts with a forum must be examined over\na period of time and finding a six-year period reasonable).\nPrince Salman’s deceased son’s contacts with the United\nStates are irrelevant to this Court’s analysis. Keeton vy.\nHustler Magazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 781 n. 13, 104\nS.Ct. 1473, 79 L.Ed.2d 790 (“Each defendant’s contacts\nwith the forum State must be assessed individually.”).\nPrince Salman’s ownership of shares m Texas\ncorporations, on its own, cannot be considered\nsufficiently systematic and continuous to establish general\njurisdiction. Helicopteros, 466 U.S. at 414-16, 104 S.Ct.\n1868 (finding CEO’s travel to forum for contract\nnegotiations, employees’ travel to forum for training,\nreceipt of funds drawn on forum bank accounts, and\npurchase from forum companies were not contacts\nsufficiently systematic and continuous to establish general\njurisdiction). Plaintiffs have not presented a genuine issue\nof jurisdictional fact such that discovery is necessary.\nDaventree, 349 F.Supp.2d at 761. Plaintiffs have not\nsatisfied the constitutional requirement of showing that\nthe Princes have minimum contacts with the United\nStates. Accordingly, Prince Salman’s and Prince Naif’s\nmotions to dismiss the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal\ncomplaints for lack of personal jurisdiction are granted.\n\nWESTLAW\n\n*360 B. Rabita Trust®\n[1 Plaintiffs allege that Rabita Trust is\n\na charitable organization which was\ncreated to organize the repatriation\nand rehabilitation of stranded\nPakistanis from Bangladesh.\nFounded in 1988, the trust fund\nwas started jointly by the\ngovernment of Pakistan and the\nSaudi-based charity, [Defendant\nMWL]. Rabita Trust received the\nmajority of its funding from the\nMWL and the Saudis, and [has]\nbeen involved with terrorism.\n\n(Ashton Compl. § 521; Burnett Compl. § 268.) The\ncharity initially recetved funding from its founders to help\nrelocate 250,000 displaced refugees. (Ashton Compl. J\n522; Burnett Compl. J 269.) Plaintiffs assert that Rabita\nTrust has actually relocated only a few hundred refugees.\n(Ashton Compl. J 522; Burnett Compl. § 269.)\n\nOn October 12, 2001, the United States Treasury\nDepartment designated Rabita Trust a Specially\nDesignated Global Terrorist Entity and froze its assets.’\n(Ashton Compl. § 312, 527; Burnett Compl. § 236;\nFederal Compl. J§ 117, 214.) Rabita Trust is allegedly\nrelated to various other charity Defendants and al Qaeda.\nFor instance, as a subsidiary of MWL, it is a “sibling\norganization of the RO.” (Ashton Compl. § 525; Burnett\nCompl. § 272; Federal Compl. § 113.) Through MWL\nand its own officers, Rabita Trust is also related to the\nSAAR Network. (Ashton Compl. [§ 338, 526-28; Burnett\nCompl. §§ 273-75; Federal Compl. § 213.) Plaintiffs\nclaim that “Rabita Trust is an al Qaeda front” and that its\nGeneral Director, Wa‘el Julaidan, is a known al Qaeda\nmember. (Ashton Compl. § 523; Burnett Compl. J 270;\nFederal Compl. ff 100, 121, 210.) In a list of orders\nobtained in a raid of BIF’s Sarajevo’s offices,\ninvestigators allegedly recovered a document from Osama\nbin Laden regarding the management of Islamic charities\nin which he urged the creation of a committee to receive\nand distribute donations to al Qaeda and suggests Rabita\nTrust’s participation. (Federal Compl. Jf 195, 211.)\n\nRabita Trust claims that it does not have an office in the\nUnited States and that the complaints are devoid of any\nallegations that it directed money to terrorists.
