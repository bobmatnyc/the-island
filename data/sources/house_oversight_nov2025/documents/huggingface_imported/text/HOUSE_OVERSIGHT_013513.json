  "text": "Descartes, the essential Enlightenment rationalist, was responsive to his “...call of\nthe Spirit...” Napier the inventor of logarithms wrote an exegetical commentary on\nthe Book of Revelations. The mathematician and physicist, Pascal, believing that\ncontact with a religious relic had cured his terminally ill sister, wrote long tracks\nabout whether or not the Devil could work miracles. The great mathematician,\nCauchy, was known for his persistent efforts to convert fellow mathematicians to\nRoman Catholicism. Gauss, who was not particularly religious, said that a difficult to\nprove theorem did not result from hard work but “...the grace of God.” In letters\nbetween Liebniz, who along with Newton was the inventor of calculus, and a\nmember of the family of great mathematicians, John Bernoulli, used scriptural\nquotations and biblical diagrams as part of their theoretical correspondence.\nPerhaps the greatest mathematician of the 18\" Century (or ever), Euler, in his\nLetters to a German Princess, discussed the functional characteristics of spirits and\n\ntt\n\nthe connections between body and soul. Bell said Euler “...never discarded a\nparticle of his Calvinist faith.”\n\nIt was to the working out of a law of mechanics called “the principle of least\naction” that Ernst Mach attributed the beginning of the separation of physical\nmechanics from formal theology. The flavor of this change is captured in his 1893\nThe Science of Mechanics that stimulated Bridgeman’s 1936 more formal\nphilosophical analyses of physical theory, from a position that came to be called\noperationalism: the restriction of physical concepts to those definable in terms of the\nexperimental operations required to demonstrate or prove them. Mach said that\nthese events marked the move of formal metaphysical thinking about mechanics\nand the physical sciences more generally into the personal and private realm of\nbelief and meaning.\n\nMaupertuis, an eccentric friend of Frederick the Great and president of the\nBerlin Academy, proposed the principle of least action as evidence of the infinite\nwisdom of the Creator. As an early psychopharmacologist, Maupertuis\nrecommended the use of opium to facilitate creative thought and was famously\nparodied for doing so by Voltaire in his 1752 story in which he is portrayed as the\n\nnaively foolish Dr. Akakia. The physical law of least action belongs to a set of ideas\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013513",
