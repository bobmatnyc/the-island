Culturomic ‘timelines’ reveal how often a word or phrase appears in books over time. (A) ‘civil\n\nrights’, ‘women’s rights’, ‘children’s rights’ and ‘animals rights’ are shown. (B) ‘genocide’ (blue), ‘the\n\nHolocaust’ (green), and ‘ethnic cleansing’ (red) (C) Ideology: ideas about ‘capitalism’ (blue) and\n\n‘communism’ (green) became extremely important during the ac\" century. The latter peaked during the\n\n1950s and 1960s, but is now decreasing. Sadly, ‘terrorism’ (red) has been on the rise. (D) Climate\n\nchange: Awareness of ‘global temperature’, ‘atmospheric CO2’, and ‘sea levels’ is increasing. (E) ‘aspirin’\n\n(blue), ‘penicillin’ (green), ‘antibiotics’ (red), and ‘quinine’ (cyan). (F) ‘germs’ (blue), ‘hygiene’ (green)\n\nand ‘sterilization’ (red). (G) The history of economics: ‘banking’ (blue) is an old concept which was of\n\ncentral concern during ‘the depression’ (red). Afterwards, a new economic vocabulary arose to\n\nsupplement the older ideas. New concepts such as ‘recession’ (cyan), ‘GDP’ (purple), and ‘the economy’\n\n(green) entered everyday discourse. (H) We illustrate geographical name changes: ‘Upper Volta’ (blue)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017058",
