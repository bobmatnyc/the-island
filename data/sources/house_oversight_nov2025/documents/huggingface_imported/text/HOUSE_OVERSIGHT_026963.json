The amount they could lose is potentially unlimited and can\nexceed the amount they originally deposited with your firm. Prior to buying a security future you must receive a copy of the Risk Disclosure Statement for\nSecurity Futures Contracts.\n\nNon-US Securities. Investing in non-US securities involves the risk of loss as a result of more or less non-US government regulation, less public information,\nless liquidity and greater volatility in the countries of domicile of the issuers of the securities and/ or the jurisdiction in which these securities are traded. In\naddition, investors in securities such as ADRs/ GDRs, whose values are influenced by foreign currencies, effectively assume currency risk.\n\nOptions.
