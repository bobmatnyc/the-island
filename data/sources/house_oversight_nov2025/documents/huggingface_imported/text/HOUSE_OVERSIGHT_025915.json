  "text": "illegals that are demanding and costing American taxpayers billions of dollars and second Closing 34 Muslim\ntraing Camps throughout our country! I WOULD LIKE TRUMP OR ANY OTHER CANDIDATES\nPLEDGE TO REINSTATE ANY AND ALL MILITARY OFFICERS DISCHARGED BECAUSE THEY\nDISAGREED WITH OBAMA OR HIS POLICIES!!\n\nbis\n\n>> Here is another that kind of wraps up my feelings about Trump\n\n>> Raccoon's in your basement! An interesting analogy\n\n>> You've been on vacation for two weeks, you come home, and your basement is infested with\n\nraccoon's. Hundreds of rabid, messy, mean raccoon's have overtaken your basement. You want them gone\nimmediately so you hire a guy. A pro. You don't care if the guy smells, you need those raccoon's gone\npronto and he's the guy to do it! You don't care if the guy swears, you don't care if he's an alcoholic, you don't\ncare how many times he's been married, you don't care if he voted for Obama, you don't care if he has\nplumber's crack...you simply want those raccoon's gone!\n\nSoe\n\n>> You want your problem fixed! He's the guy. He's the best. Period. That's why Trump. Yes he's a bit of\nan ass, yes he's an egomaniac, but you don't care.\n\n>> The country is a mess because politicians suck, the Republican Party is two-faced & gutless, illegal's are\neverywhere. You want it all fixed! You don't care that Trump is crude, you don't care that he insults people,\nyou don't care that he had been friendly with Hillary, you don't care that he has changed positions, you don't\ncare that he's been married 3 times, you don't care that he fights with Megyn Kelly and Rosie O'Donnell, you\ndon't care that he doesn't know the name of some Muslin terrorist,...this country is weak, bankrupt, our\nenemies are making fun of us, we are being invaded by illegal's, we are becoming a nation of victims where\nevery Tom, Ricardo and Hamad is a special interest group with special rights\n\n>> to a point where we don't even recognize the country we were born and raised in; “AND WE JUST\nWANT IT FIXED” and Trump is the only guy who seems to understand what the people want.\n\nbis\n\n>> You're sick of politicians, sick of the Democratic Party, Republican Party, and sick of illegal's. You just\nwant this thing fixed. Trump may not be a saint, but doesn't have any lobbyist money influencing him, he\ndoesn't have political correctness restraining him, all you know is that he has been very successful, a good\nnegotiator, he has built a lot of things, and he's also not a politician, so he's not a cowardly politician. And he\nsays he'll fix it. You don't care if the guy has bad hair. You just want those raccoon's gone. Out of your house!\n>\n\n>> This one is more about why we don’t want Hillary.\n\n>> | think this sums it up well !\n\n>> Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are in a bar. Donald leans over, and with a smile on his face, says, \"The\nmedia are really tearing you apart for That Scandal.”\n\nbis\n\n>> Hillary: \"You mean my lying about Benghazi?\"\n\n>> Trump: \"No, the other one.”\n\nSo\n\n>> Hillary: \"You mean the massive voter fraud?\"\n\n>> Trump: \"No, the other one.”\n\n>\n\n>> Hillary: \"You mean the military not getting their votes counted?\"\n\n>> Trump: \"No, the other one.”\n\nSoe\n\n>> Hillary: \"Using my secret private server with classified material to Hide my Activities?\"\n\n>> Trump: \"No, the other one.”\n\n>>\n\n>> Hillary: \"The NSA monitoring our phone calls, emails and everything Else?\"\n\n>> Trump: \"No, the other one.”\n\nSoe\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025915",
