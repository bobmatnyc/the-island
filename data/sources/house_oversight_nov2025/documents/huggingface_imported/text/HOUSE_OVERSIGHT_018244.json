  "text": "ceiling, penknife jabbed into his leg, Su Qin had learned in those long, effortful years\nof study? What secret had he penetrated? What sort of education had he finally\nreceived at the end of his humiliations and breakthroughs? He had mastered the\nenergy of his age - and the exact right sensibility to use it. Might we, Nan seemed to\nbe asking, do the same?\n\n7.\n\nFaced with the mad unsettling of his world during the Industrial Revolution of the\nmid 19 century, the German philosopher Friederich Nietzsche once mused that\nsurvival and greatness would depend on having what he called a “Sixth Sense”, by\nwhich he meant a feeling for history. Surely, he felt, an instinct for ancient balances\nand truths would provide a guide rail of sorts as the world lurched into a new age,\nalong an uncharted road.? If you could say “This has happened before” or “This is\nhow we got to where we are,” Nietzsche believed, it was the first step towards\nknowing where to go next. Nan and Kissinger knew the need for something else for\nour age as well, for a different instinct. It wasn’t just about knowing your history or\nfeeling the real possibility of human progress or tragedy. Rather it was about feeling\nout the roots of the present in a certain way. All of our ideas - from how we love to\nwhat we think of politics - are taken from the feedback and experience of our lives,\nfrom what we've seen and done and felt and learned. We are the sum total of our\nexperiences, in this sense. But what to do if changes happen at some deeper,\ninsensible level where the old ideas and instincts, where the tools of sight and smell,\nof feel and taste and hearing don’t fully answer? What to do when we are confronted\nwith what we've never experienced before? Never even dreamed of, perhaps?\n\nThis book is the story of a completely fresh way of feeling our world. By this I mean\na sensation that is as newborn as the lively sense of connection, of freedom, of\nelectric uncertainty and hope that come with the knowledge that we are unboxing a\nnew age. If Nietzsche’s era demanded a feeling for history, our own age insists ona\n\n3 Surely, he felt: Nietzche describes the “Sixth Sense” in Beyond Good and Evil in the\nfollowing way: “The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly the order\nof rank of the evaluations according to which a people, a society, a human being has\nlived, the ‘divinatory instinct’ for the relationships of these evaluations, for the\nrelation of the authority of values to the authority of effective forces): this historical\nsense, to which we Europeans lay claim as our specialty, has come to us in the wake\nof the mad and fascinating semi-barbarism into which Europe has been plunged\nthrough the democratic mingling of classes and races—only the nineteenth century\nknows this sense, as its sixth sense. The past of every form and mode of life, of\ncultures that formerly lay close beside or on top of one another, streams into us\n“modern souls” thanks to this mingling, our instincts now run back in all directions,\nwe ourselves are a kind of chaos. In the end, as I said before, ‘the spirit’ perceives its\nadvantage in all this.” See Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche and Rolf Horstmann.
