American politics gets reduced in the end to only a few\nissues: pro-life or pro-choice, gun laws, and establishment vs. anti-establishment. Political categories\nare so wishy washy and intermingled with what is termed 'liberal'’ and ‘conservative’ that one forgets\nwhat they actually mean.\n\nOf course, not everybody who voted for Trump is sexist or a racist, but, on some level, they didn't care\nif he is. He knew how to gather momentum with the discourse he chose, and, even if he changes his tone,\nhe has let loose a storm. We will brace ourselves over here for Putin's eventual takeover of the Baltic\nStates. Putin has extended his power back into Republic of Georgia, the Crimea, and Armenia. Trump has\nsaid that he would not come to the aid of Nato allies if they were attacked. IS is the least of our\nproblems here in Germany; Erdogan is a much larger threat, for now.\n\nI don't see Hillary Clinton as being at fault. I see the growth of nationalism (all throughout the world,\nnot just in the USA) and an underestimation of the fear that non-Hispanic whites have about the\ntrajectory they are on to become a minority Cin the USA and other European countries).\n\nEvery news show, talk show, etc here is discussing and analysing the fallout of Trump's win. German\n\npoliticians are hoping to learn from it, to stem the growth of the right wing AFD party here. As far as I\nknow, Merkel is the only leader who congratulated Trump with a warning.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032362",
