  "text": "e celebrate creativity with many competitions and prizes. I\nW been a student of problem lists of over the years. Here\nis my list of the problems remaining open in the modern\nworld. I’ve tied it in with other lists where relevant, and indicate what\nyou might win if you were to solve one. As I was writing this book, a few\n\nof the questions were answered; the Higgs Boson was discovered and the\nPoincaré Conjecture proven. I will keep the list up to date on the web site.\n\n1. Mathematics \"e's Med!\n1.1 The Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.“\n1.2 Hodge Conjecture ©\n1.3. Navier-Stokes Equations ©\n1.4 A proof or disproof of P =NP ©\n1.5 The Poincaré Conjecture © —- Solved\n1.6 Riemann Hypothesis °°\n1.7 Yang-Mills Theory ©\n1.8 Can we understand and solve all 23 Hilbert Problems ™**\n1.9 Goldbach Conjecture ™\n1.10 Is mathematics fundamental to or simply a good model of\nour Universe? \"°\n1.11 Is mathematics an emergent property in our Universe or\ncausal? Which is more fundamental?\n1.12 Fermat’s own original proof of his theorem!\n\n2. Physi cs Nobel Prize for Physics\n\n2.1 Are there many worlds or just one?\n\n2.2 Does quantum collapse have meaning?\n\n2.3 Will we find the Higgs-Boson? (Provisionally yes, 2012)\n\n2.4 Do we need quantum gravity to explain human thought?\n\n2.5 Will we observe gravitational waves, and what is the\ncurrent explanation for gravitational noise?\n\n2.6 What causes the arrow of time and the asymmetry of\nphysical laws?\n\n2.7 Do the constants of physics change over time?\n\n2.8 Is quantum computation sufficient to simulate the universe,\nor is the universe non-computational?\n\n2.9 Can magnetic monopoles exist?\n\n2.10 What is meant by quantum non-locality, a.k.a., spooky\n\naction at a distance?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016047",
