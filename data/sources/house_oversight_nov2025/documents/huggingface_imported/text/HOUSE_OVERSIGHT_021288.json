  "text": "For research purposes, loneliness\nis typically measured on a continuum\nthat ranges from not at all lonely (.e.,\nsocially connected) to very lonely. It is\ninformative, however, to get a sense of\nthe prevalence of loneliness when\nassessed as present or absent. Loneliness\nis a common experience; as many as 80\npercent of people under 18 years of age\nand 30 percent of people over 65 years\nof age report being lonely at least\nsometimes. For most people, feelings of\nloneliness are situational and transient\n(e.g., geographic relocation). For as\nmany as 15-30% of the general\npopulation, however, loneliness is a\nchronic state, and it is among these\nindividuals that loneliness wreaks its\ngreatest havoc. In a study of children\nfollowed through young adulthood,\nthose who were highly lonely at each of\nthree measurement occasions (i.¢.,\nchildhood, adolescence, and at 26 years\nof age) exhibited a significantly greater\nnumber of standard health risks. The\nchronically lonely individuals were more\nlikely to have higher body mass index\n(BMI), elevated blood pressure, higher\nlevels of total cholesterol, lower levels\nof “good” HDL cholesterol, greater\nconcentrations of glycosylated\nhemoglobin (an index of impaired\nglucose metabolism), and poorer\nrespiratory fitness than those who were\nlonely at only two or one of the\nmeasurement occasions.” In a study of\nolder adults, loneliness predicted\nmortality over a 3-year period, and\nincreased mortality was explained by the\nfact that lonely individuals had more\nchronic diseases and functional\nlimitations.’ Higher rates of mortality in\nlonely individuals do not appear to be\nattributable to inadequate healthcare\nutilization: even after accounting for the\npresence and severity of chronic illness,\n\nPage |42\n\nlonely individuals are actually more\nlikely than nonlonely individuals to\nmake use of health facilities and\nphysicians.*\n\nMost chronic diseases (e.g.,\nhypertension, coronary artery disease,\ndiabetes) are the result of the interactive\ninfluences of genetic, environmental,\nand behavioral factors on physiological\nfunctioning. How do feelings of\nloneliness penetrate to a level that affects\ndisease risk? Plausible pathways include\npoor health behaviors, stress-related\nprocesses, restorative “anti-stress”\nprocesses, and even differences in\npatterns of gene activity. In general,\nphysiological systems exhibit\nredundancies and compensatory\nprocesses that minimize the immediate\nhealth effects of adverse heritable,\nenvironmental, and behavioral factors.\nHowever, subtle changes in these\npredisease pathways can be detected\nprior to the onset of manifest disease and\nmay indicate the beginnings of a steeper\ndownward trajectory in resilience.”\n\nTake health behaviors, for\ninstance. Major risk factors for disease\nin Western society include high-calorie,\nhigh-fat diets, and sedentary lifestyles,\neach of which contribute to being\noverweight or obese. Feelings of\nloneliness have been associated with\ngreater incidence of these predominantly\nlifestyle risk factors. In a large cross-\nsectional survey of adults 18 years and\nolder, the lonely group had a higher\nmean BMI and a greater proportion of\noverweight/obese individuals than did\nthe nonlonely group. Loneliness has\nbeen associated with lower levels of\nphysical activity in every age group from\ngrade school to middle-age adults. In the\nlatter study, lonely individuals were also\nmore likely to become inactive over\ntime. Changes in health status also\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021288",
