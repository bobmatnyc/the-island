I allowed as promised to give you \nauthority. . you set a target. . it hit the traget, you moved in back. based on media reporting on trump \nvisit? you didnt act. the market dipped and you panicked. . AMATEUR. wrong options wrong timing, \nno discipline and as a percentaage of investment, a one day dip fof 25%. wanting to buy the highter strike , is \nok. but why the same month? why the same moment. why the same index. . sorry. I have taught this for \nmany years. and your grade is an F. not one good move in many. . re broadcom. the crack happend in \nthe morning, options were higher. no alternative presented. no analysis. , this is no way to manage \nmoney.
