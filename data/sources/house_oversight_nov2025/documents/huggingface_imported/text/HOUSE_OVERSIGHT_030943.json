To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William.\nBrennan: “\"any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich.\"\" ’ .\n\nThis means all evidence, regardless of its ambiguous nature, will be interpreted to support their\nassumption of wrongdoing.\n\n~ They will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy\nhas quoted me: \"\"The 'E' in E-mail stands for evidence.\"\n\nSix months from now 7 iey uncover an ere from the County Manager to Walton stating that\n‘Commissioner X wants to know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He\nreplies that it was.\n\nMonths later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous E-mail. Based on the merits, he happens to\nrank Y's bid number one.\n\nYou can bet as sure as J. Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code\nfrom Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y.\n\n- Armed with the E-mail you can be damnes sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with\neverything including a stint in Gitmo.\n\nAll of this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules.\nMemorize them.\n\n1. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.\n\n2. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.\n\n3. Do not talk to the FBI without a law\n\nGrant J.
