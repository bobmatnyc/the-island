  "text": "forced decision between yes and no is called the excluded middle. The\nconstructionist mathematician, an orientation without the excluded middle, asserts\nthat “an odd perfect number exists” would only be meaningful if one could show that\nsuch a number had been found or constructed. The classical mathematician would\nfind the phrase “no odd perfect number exists” meaningful without a concrete\nexample, if the assumption of its existence would lead to a no (versus yes)\ncontradiction encountered in the proof-relevant network of established theorems\nand their relations. The symbolic operations of these formal schools of mathematics\nand their relationship to the objective and ideational realities of brain-mind-spiritual\nlife have been viewed by some as Western cultural products rather than\nexpressions of secular or spiritual Absolutes. Still others have argued that cultural\nrelativism is not relevant here because mathematicians worldwide constitute a\nmonoculture.\n\nWith respect to the real world existence of abstract mathematical structure,\nour Platonic bias must be obvious. The thrilling experience of a new reality | get to\nknow from finally understanding how a theorem works and the rush of peering into\nthe grandeur of the Grand Canyon feel like the same kind of full-of-wonder high to\nme. | blend them here without reservation. Perhaps this world of spiritual abstraction\nis closer to the orientation of the school of intuitionist mathematics. |ts founder,\nL.E.J. Brouwer, required that every mathematical construction be so immediately\napparent to the human mind that no formal proof was necessary. This became my\nform of spiritual transcendence, which led naturally to a mathematical, mystical\nfaith.\n\nWe carry the explication of this kind of reality further. Reflections of the good\nand evil, right and left, moral directional biases and their relative weightings in born\nagain bifurcations to invariant circles called limit cycles, can be symbolically\nrepresented in what are called the complex eigenvalues of matrices describing the\nsystem’s set of orthogonal motions with changes in their control parameters. The\nbehavior of these complex eigenvalues underlies and characterizes the\n\nmathematical mechanism of the Hopf bifurcation.\n\n159\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013659",
