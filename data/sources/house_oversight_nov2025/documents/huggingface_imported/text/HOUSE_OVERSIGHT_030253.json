  "text": "As the President, by nature and design, tries to claim aggressive\nnew powers, the Mueller team, almost in equal proportion, is trying to\nlimit the theory of Presidential power and, even, to criminalize an\nexpansive exercise of those powers.\n\nPeople who know and have worked with Mueller find it, at best,\nunexpected that this traditional by the book G-man would be pursuing\nsuch far-reaching legal theories. But one possible explanation, shared by\nmany in the White House, is that Mueller is overly reliant on his staff—\nin fact, is being led by his number two, Andrew Weissmann.\n\nWeismann has a longstanding reputation for aggression: he was\nthe prosecutor whose pursuit of the accounting firm Arthur Anderson in\nthe Enron debacle ended in its conviction—a judgment reversed well\nafter the firm's bankruptcy and dissolution. One White House advisor\nlikened him to Victor Hugo's obsessed policeman Inspector Javert—a\nprosecutor consumed with taking down the President. Indeed,\nWeissmann, who has in the past contributed to Democratic candidates,\nis a particular bet noir and favorite whipping boy for the White House\nhis central role in the Mueller investigation taken there as evidence of a\ndeep bias against Donald Trump.\n\nBut in another view it is precisely because Mueller, a former\nMarine, is so by the book and Semper Fi that he finds Trump's behavior\nto be personally offensive, and, on its face, corrupt. \"Bob Mueller is all\nabout limits and rules. Donald Trump has none and acknowledges\nnone,\" said one lawyer who has worked with Mueller in the past.\n\nIt may yet be even a more profound clash then that, the executive\nbranch at war with itself—the Justice Department against the White\nHouse. In this, the President's almost daily tirades against the DOJ, the\nAttorney General, Jeff Sessions, the Deputy Attorney General,\nRosenstein, the former head of the FBI, Comey, and his former deputy,\nAndrew McCabe, are part of an effort to obstruct justice and save\nhimself.\n\nThe Mueller strategy (or Weissmann strategy) is a war strategy, in\nthe view of some legal observers. An indictment of the President would\nbe litigated to the hilt. It would force both the substantive issues of\nobstruction and abuse of power and the meta issues of Presidential\nimmunity—in essence, the President's claims to being above the law—\ninto open court for a long and painful review and dissection that might\nshadow the November election.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030253",
