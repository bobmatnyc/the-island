In order to permit victims of crime to watch criminal trial proceedings, the court\nmay authorize closed-circuit televising of the proceedings for viewing by victims or other persons the court determines have a\ncompelling interest in doing so.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe CVRA grants victims the right to attend trials, as noted previously in connection with proposed Rule 43.1. 74° At the same\n\ntime, however, the CVRA recognizes that in situations with numerous victims, the court may have to craft \"a reasonable\nprocedure\" to protect victims’ rights. 34! One such reasonable procedure would appear to be closed-circuit transmission of\ncourt proceedings to a facility sufficiently large to accommodate all the victims. This was the procedure followed in the\nOklahoma City bombing case. *47\n\n[*923] The proposed rule would authorize such transmission in appropriate cases. The language for the proposed rule comes\nfrom 42 U.S.C. /0608(a), which authorizes closed-circuit transmissions \"notwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure to the contrary\" in cases in which a proceeding has been transferred more than 350 miles - as was the case\nwith the Oklahoma City bombing trial. In light of the CVRA's mandate that the court must always craft \"a reasonable\nprocedure\" to protect the rights of multiple victims, there is no compelling reason to tie the device to such geographical\ncircumstances. The proposed rule authorizes courts to allow such transmissions in any appropriate case.\n\nRule 58 - Victims and Petty Offenses\nThe Proposal:\nCourts should hear from victims regarding sentences in petty cases as follows:\n\nRule 58. Petty Offenses and Other Misdemeanors.\n\n(3) Sentencing. The court must give the defendant an opportunity to be heard in mitigation and then proceed immediately to\nsentencing. The court must also give victims an opportunity to be heard. The court may, however, postpone sentencing to allow\nthe probation service to investigate or to permit either party to submit additional information.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe CVRA gives a \"victim\" the right to be heard at sentencing. The CVRA defines \"victim\" as including anyone who is\ndirectly and proximately harmed by \"a Federal offense.\" *47 The Act does not limit those offenses to felonies or\nmisdemeanors. Accordingly, a victim has a right to be heard at sentencing for any petty offense, as would be reflected in the\nproposed rule.\n\n[*924]\nConclusion\n\nThe CVRA commands that victims be made participants in the federal criminal process and thus requires significant changes to\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This Article has provided one possible and comprehensive way to implement that\ncongressional command with specific language and supporting analysis for each change. Undoubtedly there are other ways of\n\n340 See supra notes 277-308 and accompanying text.\n\n341 18 USCA. 3771(d)(2).\n\n342 See Paul G. Cassell & Robert F.
