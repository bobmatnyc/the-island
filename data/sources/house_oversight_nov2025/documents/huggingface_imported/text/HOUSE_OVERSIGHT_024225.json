  "text": "Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL\n\nThey are in a capital-intensive business and need to preserve deep, low-cost access to both the equity\nand debt capital markets. Moreover, collateral requirements for forward power price hedging\ntypically will spike if a utility loses its investment grade rating, which can spur concern about liquidity.\n\nBuilding conviction around a dividend cut thesis requires more than screening. Our process focuses\non researching capex flexibility, cost-cutting potential and asset divestiture potential to determine\nthe flexibility a company has under various scenarios. Our research process breaks capex into 3\nbuckets: i) committed capex (e.g. required by the regulator), ii) nondiscretionary capex (e.g. major\nplant overhauls — CEOs tend to avoid delays so as not to jeopardize billion dollar-plus assets), and iii)\ndiscretionary capex (CEOs can delay but may jeopardize future growth).\n\nRegarding opex, we look for cost-cutting capability, which we estimate by breaking apart the opex\nline or by global benchmarking. Finally, we estimate the potential impact from possible asset\ndivestitures and the resulting impact on earnings and leverage. Once we have completed the\nresearch work on capex, opex and potential divestitures, we model various sensitivities from\nstructural changes or other key drivers that might cause a deterioration or improvement in a utility\ncompany’s business model against forward-looking credit rating agency (S&P, Moody’s, etc.) ratios.\n\n24 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024225",
