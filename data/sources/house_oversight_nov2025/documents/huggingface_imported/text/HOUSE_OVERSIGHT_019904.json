As much as the president himself, the chief of staff determines how the White\nHouse and executive branch—which employs 4 million people, including 1.3 million\npeople in the armed services—will run.\n\nThe job has been construed as deputy president, or chief operating officer, or even\nprime minister. Larger-than-life chiefs have included Richard Nixon’s H. R. Haldeman\nand Alexander Haig; Gerald Ford’s Donald Rumsfeld and Dick Cheney; Jimmy Carter’s\nHamilton Jordan; Ronald Reagan’s James Baker; George H. W. Bush’s return of James\nBaker; Bill Clinton’s Leon Panetta, Erskine Bowles, and John Podesta; George W. Bush’s\nAndrew Card; and Barack Obama’s Rahm Emanuel and Bill Daley. Anyone studying the\nposition would conclude that a stronger chief of staff is better than a weaker one, and a\nchief of staff with a history in Washington and the federal government is better than an\noutsider.\n\nDonald Trump had little, if any, awareness of the history of or the thinking about this\nrole. Instead, he substituted his own management style and experience. For decades, he\nhad relied on longtime retainers, cronies, and family. Even though Trump liked to portray\nhis business as an empire, it was actually a discrete holding company and boutique\nenterprise, catering more to his peculiarities as proprietor and brand representative than to\nany bottom line or other performance measures.\n\nHis sons, Don Jr. and Eric—jokingly behind their backs known to Trump insiders as\nUday and Qusay, after the sons of Saddam Hussein—wondered if there couldn’t somehow\nbe two parallel White House structures, one dedicated to their father’s big-picture views,\npersonal appearances, and salesmanship and the other concerned with day-to-day\nmanagement issues. In this construct, they saw themselves tending to the day-to-day\noperations.\n\nOne of Trump’s early ideas was to recruit his friend Tom Barrack—part of his kitchen\ncabinet of real estate tycoons including Steven Roth and Richard Lefrak—and make him\nchief of staff.\n\nBarrack, the grandson of Lebanese immigrants, is a starstruck real estate investor of\nlegendary acumen who owns Michael Jackson’s former oddball paradise, Neverland\nRanch. With Jeffrey Epstein—the New York financier who would become a tabloid\nregular after a guilty plea to one count of soliciting prostitution that sent him to jail in\n2008 in Palm Beach for thirteen months—Trump and Barrack were a 1980s and 90s set\nof nightlife Musketeers.\n\nThe founder and CEO of the private equity firm Colony Capital, Barrack became a\nbillionaire making investments in distress debt investments in real estate around the world,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019904",
