  "text": "anything I can get for you?” | asked again and he answered, “No thanks,\nwe just ate and I’m still full” and they sat down together on the stools at\nthe kitchen bench.\n\nI got out the shiny red kettle from the cupboard, knowing my way all\ntoo well around the kitchen and put it over the hot stove plate. Turning\naround to face them, I thought they were acting peculiar. “So...’Ghislane\nstarted the conversation, ‘““How was the ranch with the Prince?” It was a\nnatural reaction for me to blush, knowing exactly what she was referring\ntoo. Keeping busy preparing her cup of tea and avoiding eye contact with\nboth of them I started to unpack the counter where I had been eating, “I\nthink he had a really good time, he seemed relaxed during the trip and\nwhen we said good-bye to each other he gave me a kiss.” I went on to tell\nthem what we did together “I took him horseback riding, nowhere to far\njust around the property, um... we went swimming in the pool, and of\ncourse I gave him plenty of massages. He had a massage at least couple\ntimes each day really seeming to enjoy his time there.” It’s what they\nwanted to hear, not the truth of how disgusting I had felt over the whole\nthing but they already knew the truth anyways, it’s what they had trained\nme for in the first place.\n\nLike two proud parents they both looked over me with such content.\n“Good, you did really well” Jeffrey complimented me. Turning around to\nthe boiling kettle, I finished Ghislane’s tea for her and the conversation\nled on to other subjects. We all ventured up to Jeffrey’s office and out\ncame the infamous duffle bag that went wherever he did. | was given\nclose to a thousand dollars for my time in Santa Fe, more than what I\nthought anybody at my young age could make for a couple days of work.\n‘It was fulfilling the obscene vulgar needs of the so-called privileged that\nearned me so much.\n\nChapter 18\n\nI spent the next few days in New York, venturing out to do some\nshopping therapy. I loved the eccentric parts of the city. Every street was\ndifferent but the same energetic vibe filled all of them, animated with all\ndifferent walks of life. Hanging out at coffee shops reading the newspaper\nor a good book was a favorite pastime while in the big apple. Being close\nenough to get back to Jeffrey for when he needed me but also far enough\nto get away from all of it. Most of the day slipped by without being\nmissed and [ made my way back to Jeffrey’s.\n\nMaking one last pit stop, I walked into an old bookshop to browse at\ntheir assortment of old titles. | wasn’t in any hurry so I took my time\n\n107\n\n[2 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004240\n\nreading the backs of interesting looking books. I bumped into a girl\nlooking down the same aisle I was down. “Sorry, I’m so clumsy” she was\napologizing for my mistake. “No, no, it was.my fault, I wasn’t looking at\nwhere I was going. I get so wrapped up with my nose in a book and trip\nover my own two feet if I’m not careful enough.” We were both giggling\nnow and I further introduced myself to her. Her name was Valerie or\nVickie or something like that, anyways she was a student at a school for\nhairdressing nearby. Chatting away both young and similar interests in\neach other’s choice of reading we found it easy to speak with one another.\nShe wasn’t from around here only being in the city for the last two\nmonths, her parents hated her being here, but were also supportive in her\nbig decision to move from the countryside in hopes of her accomplishing\nher own dreams. Aside from not having her near them, they just wanted\nher to be happy and supported in her big decision to move to the city,\nhelping her pay some of the way.\n\nShe was a pretty girl with cherry red hair and soft white skin. Her long\nlegs were emphasized by the short flowery dress that complimented her\nhourglass figure. She would definitely fit the pro quo for going down in\none of Jeffrey’s little black books. Only imagining the look on his face\nupon meeting her I could already see his sly grin spread from ear to ear.\nKnowing exactly what he would do with her and the very thought of him\ntarnishing a sweet country girl such as her just couldn’t be done. It was\nthe beginning of a turning point in my life that started with realizing | had\na choice at hand and the effect I could have on one person alone. “I must\nbe off, but it was really nice to meet you.” Bidding her goodnight and\npaying for my books I turned around with one last glance over my\nshoulder and said. “Good luck in the city!” Leaving that bookshop was a\nsmall step in a growing abundance of larger strides to come. Turning the\ncorner onto 72\" street | had an undeniable feeling in the pit of my\nstomach again but this time it wasn’t the familiar hurl of anxiety I was\nused too after I had done something [ had wrong that I had regretted, it\nwas a new feeling of pride and inner strength. I quite liked it a lot, I held\nmy head high and smiled on the inside when Jeffrey asked me how my\nday was and what I got up to, not mentioning I had let one girl slip on\nbye.\n\nThe icy winter winds faded away making way for the approaching\nsunny days that blossomed the colorful shades of spring. This was my\nfavorite time of the year. Making the most use of his island we spent\ncountless days of the increasingly hot days there. A constant array of\nvisiting guests and plentiful young women to flock around keeping them\nentertained was the typical lazy afternoon on Little St. Jeff’s. We ate,\ndrank, and played under the blue blanket of cloudless skies. To many this\nlifestyle could seem idyllic, unless you were like me, the one on the other\n\n108\n\n1] Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFRLO0424 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021198",
