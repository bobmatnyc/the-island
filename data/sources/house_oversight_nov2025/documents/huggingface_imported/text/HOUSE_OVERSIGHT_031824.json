All of sudden the NPA in EB’s case goes from no\njurisdiction even to prosecute to you avoiding a possible life\nsentence. Moronic.\n\nMan I sure would like to see you getting some in the W column though and\nsome press that at least presents the true facts that some of the girls have\nadmitted under oath. Still a story no one ever has heard and they are\ncompelling facts.\n\nGood Shabbos.\n\nThe numerous young women who say they were sexually abused by\nwealthy, Clinton-linked financier Jeffrey Epstein no longer appear set to\ntestify after a last-minute settlement was reached in a closely-watched civil\nlawsuit against the registered sex offender.\n\nhttps://www.foxnews.com/us/jeffrey-epstein-a-registered-sex-offender-settles-\ncivil-lawsuit-and-avoids-testimony-from-alleged-victims\n\nExplore the Fox News apps that are right for you at http://(www.foxnews.com/apps-\nproducts/index.html.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031824",
