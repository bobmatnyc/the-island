  "text": "for by Jeffrey, he pointed out needed changes all over the place, driving\nthe builders mad, as always. He wanted the place to scream out\n“GHISLANE” with a bold statement. Checkered floors and bold colors\nwas the theme, like the queen of hearts from Alice in Wonderland, very\nwell suited I thought.\n\nThe dust from the walls being torn down chocked my throat and the\nelevator was not in use, the stairs were hardly either. The whole house\nwas in bad shape then having to go up three flights of rickety steps was a\nbit of a risk too but worth it once you made it to her future walk in\nwardrobe or to us commoners, a closet the size of a small a house.\nComplete with a dressing room, luxurious bathroom and plenty of storage\nfor her every ensemble. Even without it being finished it was already a\nwork of art, a sanctuary for any woman. She adorned herself in her future\nhome, finally her own, relishing every inch of it, she already put in a\nwork desk and spoke constantly of its ongoing renovations. About an\nhour later we were off to pick out curtains and look at some paint samples\nat a couple different boutique looking shops. Easily passing off as an\nordinary couple for the day, they walked arm in arm strolling the streets\nof the Upper East Side. Except to me, still replaying the early afternoon’s\nevents, shaking my head over the echoed images in my mind, I followed\nbehind just waiting to be needed again.\n\nOver the course of the next few months was a constant influx of\nexorbitant excursions at Jeffrey’s mansions, mainly to his island, to keep\nup with his ever-demanding sexual appetite with various young women\nand teenage girls. I got back on the Xanax, an old habit that I felt at the\ntime would stop my memories from flowing back, rehabilitate my\nproblems and relax me enough to deal with any situation at hand, no\nmatter what the circumstance revealed itself to be. It was a drug that\nwould blind my eyes to everything I should’ve been running from.\n\nHaving Brunel always in the picture these days wasn’t helping me at all\neither. Sending his girls for Jeffrey at all of his places now and at a\nvigorous flow, they had an abundance of girls at their disposal. If I were\nto count one girl for everyday of the week, it would be the\nunderestimated statement of the century. So many girls between the two\nof them, some nights it would be a free for all frenzy for Jeffrey and\nBrunel, seven or so girls giving them their upmost attention, doting on\ntheir every moan and whimper, Jeffrey being the main concern since\nBrunel worked for him and we were all aware of that too. If there were\nheaven on earth for men like Jeffrey, than he would be their God. Every\none of his inner most desires was fulfilled when his harem of women was\naround. No wonder he didn’t travel much abroad these days, all he ever\nwanted was right at his doorstep. I couldn’t believe that he was still\nasking me to bring girls to him as well. There was never enough girls to\n\n95\n\n11 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004228\n\nfill his appetite, so on occasion I would meet a pretty girl around my age\nand invite her back to his place to make some quick money by offering\nher a really good contact in the modeling and acting business. Keeping\nhim satisfied and in need of me was a tiring job. With so much\ncompetition I had to be on the ball, seeming ambitious to grant him all of\nhis desires. It was a lot of pressure and a spotlight of a role to undertake\nat such a young age but I told myself this is what my life’s training had\nled me up to be.\n\nMy Birthday was around the comer and turning eighteen had lost all of\nits sparkle and pizzazz. There were no more surprises in store for me,\nnothing that would bedazzle me I hadn’t done already. I spent my\nbirthday on the island, having a quiet dinner and watching “Sex and the\nCity” on the couch with Jeffrey, Ghislane and Emmy. There was no cake\nor a celebration of any sort but I did get a couple of presents that I opened\noutside underneath the main cabana. Jeffrey gave me a beautiful pair of\nsapphire and diamond encrusted earrings and Ghislane bought me another\ndesigner makeup case. I thanked the two of them with a tight squeeze and\na gratuitous short spiel. As it went quiet, I looked out to the ocean and\nwondered if across these waters was there ever going to be happier days\nspent with someone special to me. Would he be kind, compassionate, and\nalways be there when I needed him most? Or would | end up settling for\nmy final bit of training, a marriage to a greedy old scrooge? Either way\nwhat I wanted most didn’t matter right now, I was still bound by Jeffrey’s\nhold over me and all I had to keep telling myself to get through this epic\njourney was, this is just the way it was for now.\n\nAround the table for breakfast Jeffrey announced that he was expecting\na few guests coming over with Brunel, no one of importance, just his\nusual entourage of beautiful girls. Russian models this time and Jeffrey\nwas also having a photographer flown in to take modeling photos using\nthe island as the perfect background for a sexy shoot. All of us girls were\nushered onto rocks, hammocks, dug into sand and displayed just about\nanywhere they wanted. We were being photographed in next to nothing,\nlike a netted fabric placed over us if the shot called for it, but the more\nprovocative the more Jeffrey and Brunel loved it.\n\nAfter the photo shoot we did some outdoor watersports. While us girls\nraced the jet skis around and jumped on the water trampoline, the men\nstayed on dry land to watch us from the beach. I was so used to this\nconstant charade of girls and I didn’t mind having a bit of fun but this\nwas different, I had to be more than just polite because | already knew it\nwouldn’t be long before we were all intimate with each other as well.\nBeing the only girl that spoke English out of all of them was also a huge\nblunder. The only way we could communicate was through hand gestures\n\n96\n\nD Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIULFREO03229\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021192",
