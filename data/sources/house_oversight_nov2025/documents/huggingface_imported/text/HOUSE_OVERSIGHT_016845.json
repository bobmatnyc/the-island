  "text": "WHAT CAN WE DO?\nDaniel C. Dennett\n\nDaniel C. Dennett is University Professor and Austin B. Fletcher Professor of\nPhilosophy and director of the Center for Cognitive Studies at Tufts University. He is the\nauthor of a dozen books, including Consciousness Explained and, most recently, From\nBacteria to Bach and Back: The Evolution of Minds.\n\nMany have reflected on the irony of reading a great book when you are too young to\nappreciate it. Consigning a classic to the a/ready read stack and thereby insulating\nyourself against any further influence while gleaning only a few ill-understood ideas from\nit is a recipe for neglect that is seldom benign. This struck me with particular force when\nI reread Zhe Human Use of Human Beings more than sixty years after my juvenile\nencounter. We should all make it a regular practice to reread books from our youth,\nwhere we are apt to discover clear previews of some of our own later “discoveries” and\n“inventions,” along with a wealth of insights to which we were bound to be impervious\nuntil our minds had been torn and tattered, exercised and enlarged by confrontations with\nlife’s problems.\n\nWriting at a time when vacuum tubes were still the primary electronic building\nblocks and there were only a few actual computers in operation, Norbert Wiener\nimagined the future we now contend with in impressive detail and with few clear\nmistakes. Alan Turing’s famous 1950 article “Computing Machinery and Intelligence,”\nin the philosophy journal Mind, foresaw the development of AI, and so did Wiener, but\nWiener saw farther and deeper, recognizing that AI would not just imitate—and\nreplace—human beings in many intelligent activities but change human beings in the\nprocess.\n\nWe are but whirlpools in a river of ever-flowing water. We are not stuff that abides, but\npatterns that perpetuate themselves. (p. 96)\n\nWhen that was written, it could be comfortably dismissed as yet another bit of\nHeraclitean overstatement. Yeah, yeah, you can never step in the same river twice. But\nit contains the seeds of the revolution in outlook. Today we know how to think about\ncomplex adaptive systems, strange attractors, extended minds, and homeostasis, a change\nin perspective that promises to erase the “explanatory gap”® between mind and\nmechanism, spirit and matter, a gap that is still ardently defended by latter-day Cartesians\nwho cannot bear the thought that we—we ourse/ves—are self-perpetuating patterns of\ninformation-bearing matter, not “stuff that abides.” Those patterns are remarkably\nresilient and self-restoring but at the same time protean, opportunistic, selfish exploiters\nof whatever new is available to harness in their quest for perpetuation. And here is where\nthings get dicey, as Wiener recognized. When attractive opportunities abound, we are apt\nto be willing to pay a little and accept some small, even trivial, cost-of-doing-business for\naccess to new powers. And pretty soon we become so dependent on our new tools that\nwe lose the ability to thrive without them. Options become obligatory.\n\n8 Joseph Levine, “Materialism and Qualia: The Explanatory Gap,” Pacific Philosophical Quarterly 64, pp.\n354-61 (1983).\n\n42\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016845",
