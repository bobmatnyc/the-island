EDWARDS, and CASE NO. CACE 15-000072\nPAUL G. CASSELL,\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\nVv.\n\nALAN DERSHOWITZ,\nDefendant.\n\nCONSOLIDATED REPLY IN SUPPORT OF NON-PARTY JANE DOE NO. 31 AND\n\nBOIES, SCHILLER & FLEXNER LLP’s MOTIONS TO QUASH OR FOR\nPROTECTIVE ORDERS REGARDING SUBPOENA SERVED ON THE NON-PARTIES\n\nDefendant served virtually identical subpoenas on non-party Giuffre, and her counsel\nBoies, Schiller & Flexner LLP (“BSF”). In an effort to conserve judicial resources, the non-\nparties are submitting a consolidated reply requesting that this Court quash the unreasonable and\noppressive subpoenas pursuant to Florida Rules of Civil Procedure 1.410(c)(1), or alternatively,\nissue protective orders sharply limiting the scope of the abusive subpoenas pursuant to Florida\nRules of Civil Procedure 1.280(c).\n\nINTRODUCTION\n\nAfter publicly stating that his main goal in seeking discovery from Giuffre is to put her in\n\n“jail”, Defendant served this non-party with a subpoena containing twenty five (25)\n\nunreasonable and oppressive requests. It is without question that Giuffre was sexually abused as\n\n' Jane Doe No. 3 is Virginia Roberts Giuffre, and will hereinafter be referred to as “Guiuffre.”\n\n> See Exhibit 1, CNN International, New Day, January 6, 2015. See also Exhibit 2, Australian Broadcasting System\n(ABC), January 6, 2015. “My goal is to bring charges against the client and require her to speak in court.”\n\n1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010906",
