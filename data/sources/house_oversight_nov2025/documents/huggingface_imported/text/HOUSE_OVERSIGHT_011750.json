  "text": "Danny Yatom called me a couple of minutes later. He said Rabin was still\nalive. But from the details he gave me, I knew it would take a miracle for him to\npull through. “Three shots, from close range,” Danny said. “From an /sraeli, a\nJew.” Like Rabin, like me too until this had actually happened, it was something\nDanny was struggling to believe. He said that he’d call me back when he knew\nanything more. But I had the TV on in the room. Before he did, I watched Eitan\nHaber announce that Yitzhak Rabin was dead.\n\nAlthough I hadn’t known it until I’d arrived, Yossi Beilin was also in New\nYork, for meetings and a speech of his own. Though he was a Peres protégé,\nand I was seen as closer to Rabin, the two of us had become friends. We\nimmediately made plans to get the next flight home. But before leaving for the\nairport, I phoned Leah Rabin. However inadequate I knew it would be in\nhelping her even begin to cope with the loss, I told her that my, and Nava’s,\nthoughts were with her. That Yitzhak’s death would leave a tremendous hole, in\nall of us, in every single Israeli. “They shot him,” she kept murmuring. “They\nshot him. They shot him. They shot him.” I called Peres, too. “Shimon, you\nhave a mountain on your shoulders,” I said. “But your task is to carry on. All of\nus will be with you, supporting, helping however we can.”\n\nIt was the saddest flight I’d ever taken. Yossi and I barely spoke. Each of us\nwas deep in thought. I found myself lost in memories of Rabin — from the very\nfirst time I’d met him, in the sayeret, to that last, long talk we’d had in his office\na couple of days earlier. For some reason, I kept wondering whether, when the\nshots had been fired, he’d been turning to look behind him. It was an\nidiosyncrasy he had, whenever he was leaving a meeting or an event — even, as I\nnow recalled vividly, when the two of us were leaving the municipal ceremony\nin Ofakim. I was behind him as we left. “Ehud,” he said, turning back, “are you\nthere?” It was a senseless detail. It wouldn’t change anything. But I still felt torn\nup inside thinking about it.\n\nAfter we landed at Ben-Gurion, I went with Nava to the Rabins’ apartment\nin Ramat Aviv. There were hundreds of people outside, and nearly a hundred\ncrowded inside the flat. Leah looked exhausted, her face ashen. “They shot\nhim,” she said over and over as Nava and I hugged her. “Three shots. In the\nback. Why?” I said there was no sane answer, but that with Yitzhak’s death,\nIsrael seemed different, the world seemed different, and emptier. Before we left,\nwe added our candles to the forest of flickering memorial lights outside the\napartment block. Then, we drove the Kings of Israel Square. Thousands of\npeople were huddled in small groups throughout the plaza, sitting around\n\n279\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011750",
