When I later asked Kucherena in Mos-\ncow why Snowden changed his story in direct contradiction of what\nKucherena had stated, he said, “Wizner.”\n\nHe was referring to Ben Wizner, Snowden’s ACLU lawyer in\nWashington, D.C. Wizner had joined the ACLU in August 2001\nafter graduating from NYU Law School and clerking for a federal\njudge. At the ACLU, he became an effective foe of NSA surveillance.\n“IT had spent ten years before this [Snowden leak] trying to bring\nlawsuits against the intelligence community,” he explained in an\ninterview with Forbes in 2014. Prior to the Snowden leak, he had\nfrequently been consulted by Poitras on government surveillance\nissues (and appeared in Poitras’s 2010 documentary, The Oath). He\nhad also been engaged in a lawsuit aimed at exposing the NSA’s sub-\npoenas for Verizon records.\n\nHe had first learned about Snowden from Poitras in January\n2013 while Snowden was still working for Dell at the NSA base in\n\n© Hawaii. At that time, Poitras did not know Snowden’s real name, but ©\nshe informed Wizner that she was in touch with a person identify-\ning himself as a senior officer in U.S. intelligence. (Poitras did not\nknow at that time that her source, Snowden, was lying to her about\nhis position.) Wizner also was shown e-mails by Poitras in which\nSnowden said he had information about the government’s secret\ndomestic surveillance program. Wizner, according to Poitras, advised\nher to stay in touch with this source.\n\nOn July 13, 2013, after Snowden asked for asylum in Russia,\nKucherena arranged an encrypted chat between Snowden and Wiz-\nner. According to Wizner, Snowden asked him at the outset, “Do you\nhave standing now?” It was a question that suggested that Snowden\nwas aware that the ACLU needed to gain standing in federal court to\nchallenge the government's alleged domestic surveillance. Up until\nnow, it was unsuccessful because it had no way to show it was a vic-\ntim of surveillance. The FISA order to Verizon, which Snowden had\ntaken had provided that standing to Wizner and the ACLU.\n\nAside from the opportunity Snowden offered the ACLU, Wiz-\nner no doubt believed in the salutary benefit of Snowden’s revela-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 176 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019664",
