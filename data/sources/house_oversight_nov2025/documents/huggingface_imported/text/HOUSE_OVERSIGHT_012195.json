  "text": "ALLEN GUTHRIE MCHUGH & THOMAS, PLLC\n\nMr. John Roth\nJune 19, 2008\nPage 13\n\nhad attained the requisite legal age. Finally, although 18 U.S.C. §2423(f)(2) also defines “illicit\nsexual conduct” as any commercial sex act with a person under the age of 18, 18 U.S.C. §2423(g)\nalso provides a specific affirmative defense as to that age element if proven by a preponderance of\nthe evidence that Mr. Epstein reasonably believed that the young women had attained the requisite\nlegal age. As we have demonstrated, time and again the women involved lied to Mr. Epstein as to\ntheir true age, representing that they were, in fact, over the age of 18. Many of them also represented\nthat they worked at local massage parlors, which presumably would have imposed a legal age\nrequirement.\n\nLastly, in contrast to 18 U.S.C. §1591, Mr. Epstein’s conduct did not involve trafficking of\nwomen or children in the sex industry, and was not part of any phenomenon that, in the aggregate,\nhad an economic impact on interstate or foreign commerce. Additionally, Mr. Epstein did not\nbenefit financially from the alleged conduct. Therefore, as the SAO determined, and still believes,\nMr. Epstein was a customer, a “John” for whom prosecutions are best left to the State to address.\nIndeed, there is no reported precedent extending federal law to a local “John” who does not violate\nthe child exploitation statutes. Indeed, CEOS does not point to a single case where federal\nprosecutors have used § 1591 ina case involving facts like these. Instead, every § 1591 prosecution\nhas involved national or international sex trafficking and/or for-profit prostitution rings, involving\nthe knowing use of minors and/or forcible coercion, or forcible rape, physical abuse or intimidation.\nThese are the elements required by the statute, and they are not met here.\n\nAlthough CEOS could, perhaps, point to United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d 1176 (11\" Cir.\n2007) as a case that, standing alone, involved wholly intrastate conduct, the facts of that case are far\ndifferent in key respects than this one. The Evans case involved both the commercial and coercive\ncomponents that Congress, and administration policy statements intended in 18 U.S.C. § 1591\nprosecutions. Evans, and his co-conspirators (Madison and Yearby) were not “Johns.” They\noperated a for profit prostitution ring marked by control of, and extreme violence toward, the\nvictims, who they knew were underage. Indeed, Evans forced one such victim, age 14 years old, to\ncontinue to work even after she had been hospitalized with AIDS. As part of their business, Evans\nand his co-conspirators provided the victims with cell phones, hotels, and condoms, and the victims\nwere forced to give all of their money from this prostitution ring to Evans and his co-conspirators.\nNone of this type of activity comes close to the facts regarding Mr. Epstein. Finally, but significantly,\nthe prostitution ring in Evans was not, in fact, entirely intrastate as the companion case of one of the\nEvans co-defendants makes clear. See, United States v. Madison, 477 F.3d 1312, 1313-1314 (1 14\nCir. 2007) (Jane Doe #2 stated that she traveled to Atlanta, Georgia with Madison to work as a\nprostitute).\n\nThus, courts, including the Eleventh Circuit in Evans, have underscored the point that § 1591\nsimply is not intended to cover the kind of alleged conduct at issue here. “Section 1591 does not\ncriminalize all acts of prostitution (a vice traditionally governed by state regulation). Rather, its\nreach is limited to sex trafficking that involves children or is accomplished by force, fraud, or\ncoercion.” United States v. Evans, 476 F.3d at 1179 n. 1; See also United States v. Sims, 171 Fed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012195",
