  "text": "But where to go and what to do? There is no one right answer to either. Use the following questions\nand resources to brainstorm:\n\nWhat makes you most angry about the state of the world?\n\nWhat are you most afraid of for the next generation, whether you have children or not?\n\nWhat makes you happiest in your life? How can you help others have the same?\nThere is no need to limit yourself to one location. Remember Robin, who traveled through South\nAmerica for a year with her husband and seven-year-old son? The three of them spent one to two\nmonths doing volunteer work in each location, including building wheelchairs in Banos, Ecuador,\n\nrehabilitating exotic animals in the Bolivian rain forest, and shepherding leather-back sea turtles in\nSuriname.\n\nHow about doing archaeological excavation in Jordan or tsunami relief on the islands of Thailand?\nThese are just two of the dozens of foreign relocation and volunteering case studies in each issue of\nVerge Magazine (www.vergemagazine.com). Reader-tested resources include:\n\nHands on Disaster Response: www.hodr.org\nProject Hope: www.projecthope.org\n\nRelief International: www.ri.org\n\nInternational Relief Teams: www.irteams.org\nAirline Ambassadors International: www.airlineamb.org\nAmbassadors for Children:\nwww.ambassadorsforchildren.org\n\nRelief Riders International:\nwww.reliefridersinternational.com\n\nHabitat for Humanity Global Village Program:\nwww.habitat.org\n\nPlaneta: Global Listings for Practical Ecotourism:\n\nwww.planeta.com\n\n4. Revisit and reset dreamlines.\nFollowing the mini-retirement, revisit the dreamlines set in Definition and reset them as needed. The\nfollowing questions will help:\n\nWhat are you good at?\n\nWhat could you be the best at?\n\nWhat makes you happy?\n\nWhat excites you?\n\nWhat makes you feel accomplished and good about yourself?\n\nWhat are you most proud of having accomplished in your life’? Can you repeat this or further develop\nit?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013987",
