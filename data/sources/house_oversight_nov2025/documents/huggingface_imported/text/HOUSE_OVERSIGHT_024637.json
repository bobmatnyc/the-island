  "text": "CHAPTER |\nExecutive Summary\n\n= Global Cannabis Consumers\n\nCannabis has mass consumer appeal around the world. Millions of people use cannabis recreationally.\nMillions more use it medicinally. In aggregate, across all state medical cannabis laws in the United States,\ncannabis is legally recognized as a form of therapy or medicine for more than 50 medical conditions,\nincluding Alzheimer’s disease, anorexia, arthritis, cancer, chronic pain, epilepsy and post-traumatic\nstress disorder. Similar to the alcohol and pharmaceutical markets, we believe that the total addressable\nconsumer market for cannabis consists of a significant portion of the global adult population.\n\nCannabis is the most widely cultivated, produced, trafficked and consumed drug worldwide,\naccording to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC). In 2003, the UNODC\nestimated that the global illegal cannabis market was $113 billion, with 160 million consumers. The\nUNODC continues to estimate the number of cannabis users worldwide and recently estimated that\n183 million people globally between the ages of 15 and 64, or more than 4% of this age group, con-\nsumed cannabis in 2015.\n\nIn 2010, the RAND Corporation (RAND) estimated that the U.S. illegal cannabis market was\n$40 billion. Adjusting this estimate solely for inflation and population growth, the U.S. illegal market\nwould now be approximately $48 billion.\n\nBoth the UNODC and RAND acknowledge the challenges inherent in studying an illegal con-\nsumer market, and both allow significant room for error in their estimates. However approximate,\ntheir estimates make clear that there is significant global demand for cannabis. Less clear is how quickly\nillegal markets will transition to legal markets, as well as the extent to which legalization may increase\noverall demand.\n\nWe believe that the growth of the global legal cannabis industry will be driven by increasing pen-\netration in largely untapped “mainstream” consumer markets, and that the legal industry could grow\nto more than two times the estimated size of the current illegal market. We believe that cannabis will\neventually become federally legal in the United States, for recreational enjoyment by adults and for use\nin a broad range of safe drugs and therapeutic products. After U.S. federal legalization, we believe that\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024637",
