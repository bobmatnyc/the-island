Cacioppo, Ph.D., the\nTiffany and Margaret Blake Distinguished\nService Professor in the Departments of\nPsychology and Psychiatry and the Director of\nthe Center for Cognitive and Social\nNeuroscience at the University of Chicago. He\nis a co-founder (with Gary Berntson) of the field\nof social neuroscience, a past president of the\nAssociation for Psychological Science and a\nrecipient of numerous awards mcluding the\nNational Academy of Sciences Troland Research\nAward and the American Psychological\nAssociation Distinguished Scientific\nContribution Award. Cacioppo’s research\nconcerns the neural, hormonal, genetic, and\nbehavioral mechanisms underlying the operation\nand maintenance of the emergent structures that\ncharacterize social species generally and humans\nin particular. He has published more than 400\nscientific articles and 16 books, including\nLoneliness: Human nature and the need for\nsocial connection (2008, Norton Books) and\nHandbook of neuroscience for the behavioral\nsciences (2009, John Wiley & Sons). Cacioppo\nis also the Director of the Chicago Social Brain\nNetwork.\n\nCacioppo has been interested both in\nthe similarities and the differences between\nhumans and other species. Human social\ncognition, emotion, behavior, and executive\nfunctioning — that is, our social brain — are\nespecially sophisticated compared to those found\nin other species. Research in the neurosciences\nsometimes focuses so much on mechanisms\ndivorced from the social settings and functions\nthey may have evolved to serve in social species\nsuch as our own that the generalizations to\nhumans are inaccurate. Animal models permit\nexperimental control and interventions that\ncannot be carried out in humans, but\nunderstanding the implications of this work for\nthe human brain and biology depends on explicit\n\nPage |18\n\nThe Social Nature of Humankind\n\nSocial species, by definition, are\ncharacterized by the formation of structures\n(e.g., dyads, families, tribes, cultures) that\nextend beyond an individual. Although we\nmay revere the rugged individualist, we are\nfundamentally a social species. I begin by\ndiscussing some of the invisible evolutionary\nforces that led members of our species to band\ntogether to form such structures. I then\nconsider how selfish genes (e.g., through\nanthropomorphism, /) might have led to social\nbrains and why the social connections and\nstructures created by humans are especially\npowerful and flexible. Finally, I describe a\nnonintuitive way of thinking about the\nabsence of satisfactory social connections\n(i.e., loneliness), mention how and why\nchronic loneliness can be so harmful, and\ndiscuss how our need for social connection\nmotivates us to search for meaning and\nconnections beyond ourselves and other\nindividuals. One implication that is explored\nhere, and in more detail in the essays to\nfollow, is that genetic and cultural adaptations,\nnot human ignorance, may be fueling the\nsearch for meaning and connection with a\ntranscendent entity or being.\n\nMythic Individualism\n\nFor at least the past century, we\nhave celebrated the power and\nintellectual might of the solitary genius.\nThis includes individuals such as\nThomas Edison who brought electrical\npower to individual households,\ntransforming night into day; Henry Ford\nwho introduced the mass production of\n\ncomparison to and knowledge of the rich\nbenefits of human social interaction and feelings\nof connection. This essay addresses this gap in\nour thinking about the genetic, neural, and\nhormonal processes that constitute our brain and\nbody and in doing so provides a different\nperspective on who we are as a unique biological\nspecies.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021264",
