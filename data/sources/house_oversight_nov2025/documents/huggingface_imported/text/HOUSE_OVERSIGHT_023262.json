  "text": "in June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout first projected at 20 . but less\nwhen artspace and debt taken out, - then only after weeks, when you delayed any detailed discussion of\nmoney wanting to give the issue a thoughtful response ( which I fully understand ) . you unilaterally\nchanged our agreement.. 5m would be reserved for the future ? . and out of the remaining 15m ,? 1\nwould receive only a third. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt , and the art space investment will also\nlead to a write- off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were surprised when I said that 1\nrequire most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I will be properly\ncompensated for my work when strategies are implemented . you may recall that you appeared offended\nand said \" are you suggesting that i would go back on my word\" I said no , of course not ! you are my\nclosest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get unhappy when it\nactually comes time for them to pay.\n\nI include below the email i sent to you on April 15, the day i was examining your returns It laid out\nmy understanding of the compensation agreed for a transaction of the magnitude to the penny of the one\njust completed.ie 600m When it appeared that the transcation would and could go foward I was the\nfirst to point out that our agreement would cost you too much money, therefore\n\nFrom day one I proposed to discount our agreement toa 50-60 million range. An extremely fair price\nfor all the transactions just completed . including Phaidon. - I was never told that this was out of\nrange. in fact, alternative methods of payment . ie my plane, or an -in-kind payment were discussed (ie\nincluding keeping the 30m portion of the fee outstanding till March ) ,I provided , only because you\nspecifically requested a detailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that i was given\naccess to. ( Phaidon was never forthcoming ) in order to make my many corrections . ( as i said more\nneeded on phaidon ). Iwas then told that Alans involvement warranted a discount . Even in the best\nof light , though it is beyond question that not one time in the three years of his retainer has he ever\nproposed a unique idea. (including any way to deal with the use issue on debras death ,or even the most\nbasic review of your largest asset by far , the BRH agreement. ) O.K. - lets say he made a contribution to\nthe plan and stretch reality beyond the pale and say it was 50 %. though no one could posit such a large\namount unless they were wearing a clown suit. , the payment and our formula of 37 percent associated\nwith the deal was known . It had both sent in writing and spoken about on the phone numerous times ,\n\na detailed execution plan was provided . then and only then, after the entire transaction was laid out for\nthe group to follow You told me that after a number of conversations with brad karp that a total of only\n20m would be paid , (and even that was more than you originally contemplated ) for both transactions .\nLeon I feel It was remarkably unfair. Did brad even knew of our prior agreements.? ?, I would ask that\nyou I and Brad karp sit together if you think it would be helpful. . I would like to send him this email, with\nyour consent of course. Ifthe transactions were never consummated , 1 would not be owed a dime,\nhowever , the expected fee was known up front. , the detailed step by step plan was followed and\noverseen by me, the amount that I had requested before the transaction had even begun, had already\nbeen heavily discounted, out of friendship, . I believe the decision re only paying 20 m has frankly , left\nme felling quite uneasy. and colors the view about the Athene or Rothschild transaction.\n\nDate: Sun, Mar 20, 2016 at 11:17 PM\n\nSubject:\nTo: Melanie Spinel ae\nglad to see you are personally on the mend - as well as the fence. -- As you know i dread money\n\ndiscussions with you-- however -we should address the issue of what you would like to do moving\nforward. re- do family office, accounting trusts , estate and apollo agreements . Along with your \"\npayment \"last year we agreed . no further obligations on each side. yes, i continued to moan. I realize\nthat though Ive done quite a lot this year already _, it is not your responsibility. . As you often like to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023262",
