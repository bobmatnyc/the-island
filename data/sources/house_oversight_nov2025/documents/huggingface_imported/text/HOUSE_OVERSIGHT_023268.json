  "text": "however - that is all in the past.\nIn order to move forward\n\nI would ask that you realize that very unlike yours, My business is only comprised of my personal\nattention and my personal time . Time that I was forced to grossly overspend on your various issues\nlast year. . As you are my very close friend I will not have you participate in a bidding process that I\nhave decided 1 will have this year for my time . (hopefully a more fair way to allocate ) I would also\nask that you keep in mind that though our deal expired months ago. (also keeping in mind , that your\nunderstanding of the final payment terms neither reflected the emails or my memory, we finished it up\nyour way. ) I have answered every call Brad , joslin, Ada or you, have made . reviewed docs over and\nover/ until once again, I was forced to insert myself strongly as I thought it dangerous not to. I made\nserious dollar and time concessions last year.very serious I am wiling to continue to accommodate\nsome of your concerns , but I am, under no circumstances , none, willing to spend my time for free.\nits not fair. After cleaning up Carlyn's mess , which was a few weeks and 30 million dollars . We\nwere both highly aware of the dire circumstances in which you found yourself last year, and in fact due\npredominately to its seriousness. and those very circumstances I took extra care in our negotiations .\n(you had claimed I had you over a barrel , ( a horrible position to be in with my very close friend.),\nunfortunately I fear that if you are not cautious ,in the near future, another barrel will appear of your\nown design )\n\nI heard you when you said you believed 1 had already been paid for the work that is now required. The\nart partnership has fully answered all your concerns and discharged all my obligations and more so.\n. (FYI Carlyns art partnership that you referenced is similar in only its title.) You will also recall\nthat you required that my payments be at the end of my work not at the beginning as everyone else's .(\nmy work was never to include hours upon hours of training your staff). I eventually agreed, this of\ncourse should make clear that the 2014 tax year that will close Oct 2015 is not covered by our past\nagreement at all. I pointed this very fact out to you when I initially proposed a multi year agreement\nright out of the box. you said you preferred not. As you said ,I have produced results to date, far in\nexcess of even my own exalted opinion of my projections. I have devoted a monumental amount of my\nlimited amount of time-- way, way in excess of our agreement. I will be fair, I am willing to roll in\nthe amount still outstanding from last year if that helps .. However, As my best student , and my only\none, you are now capable of doing most, if not all, of the required work yourself. I can put my\nwhiteboard away when you come to eat and just have fun, trade stories,. share moments ideas etc.. I\nam of course always available to guide you as a friend if you choose that route . always . It will take a\ngreat deal of your time , but you will not have to spend any more money on mine .\n\nWe are scheduled to meet fri at 430 , I leave at 5 am sat morning.\n\nDate: Tue, Feb 24, 2015 at 8:20 AM\n\nSubject:\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella - tsi—<“itsSCS\nLeon,\n\nYesterday , I again spent hours upon hours of my time with your office. ,( speak to brad to get\nflavor) and you and 1 will discuss the results in gory gruesome detail on Friday. it mirrored many other\nweeks spent doing the things that I don;t have the time to do.\n\nIn order to keep things in perspective, maybe reviewing an analogy I have used before with you,\n\nmight be helpful. You and your family are a 6 billion dollar corp. with an income between 250 -500\nmillion dollars per year. It contains a few operating biz's , a large wide array of existing investments,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023268",
