The union is required to\nfairly represent you in bargaining and\nenforcing the agreement.\n\n“Tegal conduct will not be permitted. If\nyou believe your rights or the rights of others\nhave been violated, you should contact the\nNLRB promptly to protect your rights,\ngenerally within six months of the unlawful\nactivity. You may inquire about possible\nviolations without your employer or anyone\nelse being informed of the inquiry. Charges\nmay be filed by any person and need not be\nfiled by the employee directly affected by the\nviolation. The NLRB may order an employer\nto rehire a worker fired in violation of the\nlaw and to pay lost wages and benefits, and\nmay order an employer or union to cease\nviolating the law. Employees should seek\nassistance from the nearest regional NLRB\noffice, which can be found on the Agency’s\nWeb site: http://www.nirb.gov.\n\nYou can also contact the NLRB by calling\ntoll-free: 1-866-667—NLRB (6572) or (TTY)\n1—866-315—NLRB (1-866-315-6572) for\nhearing impaired.\n\nIf you do not speak or understand English\nwell, you may obtain a translation of this\nnotice from the NLRB’s Web site or by calling\nthe toll-free numbers listed above.\n\n“*The National Labor Relations Act covers\nmost private-sector employers. Excluded\nfrom coverage under the NLRA are public-\nsector employees, agricultural and domestic\nworkers, independent contractors, workers\nemployed by a parent or spouse, employees\nof air and rail carriers covered by the Railway\nLabor Act, and supervisors (although\nsupervisors that have been discriminated\nagainst for refusing to violate the NLRA may\nbe covered).\n\n“This is an official Government Notice and\nmust not be defaced by anyone.”\n\nSubpart B—General Enforcement and\nComplaint Procedures\n\n§ 104.210 How will the Board determine\nwhether an employer is in compliance with\nthis part?\n\nThe Board has determined that\nemployees must be aware of their NLRA\nrights in order to exercise those rights\neffectively. Employers subject to this\nrule are required to post the employee\nnotice to inform employees of their\nrights. Failure to post the employee\nnotice may be found to interfere with,\nrestrain, or coerce employees in the\nexercise of the rights guaranteed by\nNLRA Section 7, 29 U.S.C. 157, in\nviolation of NLRA Section 8(a)(1), 29\nU.S.C. 158(a)(1).\n\nNormally, the Board will determine\nwhether an employer is in compliance\nwhen a person files an unfair labor\npractice charge alleging that the\nemployer has failed to post the\nemployee notice required under this\npart. Filing a charge sets in motion the\nBoard’s procedures for investigating and\nadjudicating alleged unfair labor\n\npractices, and for remedying conduct\nthat the Board finds to be unlawful. See\nNLRA Sections 10-11, 29 U.S.C. 160—\n61, and 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.\n\n§ 104.211 What are the procedures for\nfiling a charge?\n\n(a) Filing charges. Any person (other\nthan Board personnel) may file a charge\nwith the Board alleging that an\nemployer has failed to post the\nemployee notice as required by this\npart. A charge should be filed with the\nRegional Director of the Region in\nwhich the alleged failure to post the\nrequired notice is occurring.\n\n(b) Contents of charges. The charge\nmust be in writing and signed, and must\nbe sworn to before a Board agent, notary\npublic, or other person authorized to\nadminister oaths or take\nacknowledgements, or contain a\ndeclaration by the person signing it,\nunder penalty of perjury, that its\ncontents are true and correct. The\ncharge must include:\n\n(1) The charging party’s full name and\naddress;\n\n(2) If the charge is filed by a union,\nthe full name and address of any\nnational or international union of which\nit is an affiliate or constituent unit;\n\n(3) The full name and address of the\nemployer alleged to have violated this\npart; and\n\n(4) A clear and concise statement of\nthe facts constituting the alleged unfair\nlabor practice.\n\n§ 104.212 What are the procedures to be\nfollowed when a charge is filed alleging that\nan employer has failed to post the required\nemployee notice?\n\n(a) When a charge is filed with the\nBoard under this section, the Regional\nDirector will investigate the allegations\nof the charge. If it appears that the\nallegations are true, the Regional\nDirector will make reasonable efforts to\npersuade the respondent employer to\npost the required employee notice\nexpeditiously. If the employer does so,\nthe Board expects that there will rarely\nbe a need for further administrative\nproceedings.\n\n(b) If an alleged violation cannot be\nresolved informally, the Regional\nDirector may issue a formal complaint\nagainst the respondent employer,\nalleging a violation of the notice-posting\nrequirement and scheduling a hearing\nbefore an administrative law judge.\nAfter a complaint issues, the matter will\nbe adjudicated in keeping with the\nBoard’s customary procedures. See\nNLRA Sections 10 and 11, 29 U.S.C.\n160, 161; 29 CFR part 102, subpart B.\n\n§ 104.213 What remedies are available to\ncure a failure to post the employee notice?\n\n(a) If the Board finds that the\nrespondent employer has failed to post\nthe required employee notices as\nalleged, the respondent will be ordered\nto cease and desist from the unlawful\nconduct and post the required employee\nnotice, as well as a remedial notice. In\nsome instances additional remedies may\nbe appropriately invoked in keeping\nwith the Board’s remedial authority.\n\n(b) Any employer that threatens or\nretaliates against an employee for filing\ncharges or testifying at a hearing\nconcerning alleged violations of the\nnotice-posting requirement may be\nfound to have committed an unfair labor\npractice. See NLRA Section 8(a)(1) and\n8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), (4).\n\n§ 104.214 How might other Board\nproceedings be affected by failure to post\nthe employee notice?\n\n(a) Tolling of statute of limitations.\nWhen an employee files an unfair labor\npractice charge, the Board may find it\nappropriate to excuse the employee\nfrom the requirement that charges be\nfiled within six months after the\noccurrence of the allegedly unlawful\nconduct if the employer has failed to\npost the required employee notice\nunless the employee has received actual\nor constructive notice that the conduct\ncomplained of is unlawful. See NLRA\nSection 10(b), 29 U.S.C. 160(b).\n\n(b) Noncompliance as evidence of\nunlawful motive. The Board may\nconsider a knowing and willful refusal\nto comply with the requirement to post\nthe employee notice as evidence of\nunlawful motive in a case in which\nmotive is an issue.\n\nSubpart C—Ancillary Matters\n\n§ 104.220 What other provisions apply to\nthis part?\n\n(a) The regulations in this part do not\nmodify or affect the interpretation of\nany other NLRB regulations or policy.\n\n(b)(1) This subpart does not impair or\notherwise affect:\n\n(i) Authority granted by law toa\ndepartment, agency, or the head thereof;\nor\n\n(ii) Functions of the Director of the\nOffice of Management and Budget\nrelating to budgetary, administrative, or\nlegislative proposals.\n\n(2) This subpart must be implemented\nconsistent with applicable law and\nsubject to the availability of\nappropriations.\n\nc) This part creates no right or\nbenefit, substantive or procedural,\nenforceable at law or in equity by any\nparty against the United States, its\ndepartments, agencies, or entities, its\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022320",
