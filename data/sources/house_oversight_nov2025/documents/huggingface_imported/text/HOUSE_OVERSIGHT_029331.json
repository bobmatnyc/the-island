He has produced it all, from elaborate fairytale-themed\nfundraising galas for Massachusetts General Hospital for Children to Chelsea Clinton’s “wedding\nof the decade” to State Dinners hosted by President Barack Obama and First Lady Michelle\nObama.\n\nRafanelli and his firm, Rafanelli Events, have a simple philosophy: every event is a unique\ncreative challenge deserving of a one-of-a-kind approach. “My team listens to what you’re\nimagining and then comes back with an idea you never expected,” he says. “We hone in on\nevery last detail so we can always deliver clients the highest level of service.”\n\nThe media has taken notice. A recent feature in OUT magazine reads, “For a flawlessly executed\naffair to remember, a behind-the-scenes mastermind juggles the details. If you’re lucky, that\nperson will be event planner Bryan Rafanelli.” And the headline of a recent New York Times\nprofile —For Wedding Planner, Obsession with Privacy— reinforces that Rafanelli is tight-lipped no\nmatter whom the client is, letting his work speak for itself.\n\nRafanelli has been named “Man of the Moment” by Town & Country (2010), a 2011 “Innovator”\nand “Event Producer of the Year” by BizBash, one of OUT magazine’s “100 Most Compelling\nPeople in 2010”, a “Trendsetter of the Year” by Modern Bride, a “40 Under 40” by the Boston\nBusiness Journal and “Best in Boston” eight years running by Boston magazine. His events have\nbeen highlighted in: The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal, The Washington Post, People,\nNew York, CBSNews.com, VanityFair.com, NewYorker.com and more. Rafanelli has also\nappeared as an industry expert on regional and national television programs including: “The\nMartha Stewart Show”, ABC’s “Good Morning America”, NBC’s “The Today Show” and as a\nregular contributor on New England Cable News’ “Morning Show.”\n\nRafanelli grew up in a large Rhode Island family, his mother always finding reason to throw\nparties for the people she loved. “The sense of community and of bringing people together to\nhave good time just for ‘good time’s sake’ has always been inside me,” he says. He launched\nRafanelli Events in 1996 as a three-person operation executing only a handful of events a year. It\nhas quickly evolved into a full-service event design, strategy, planning and production company\nwith more than 100 events annually in venues around the world. Headquartered in Boston,\nRafanelli Events also has offices in New York City, Washington, DC and Palm Beach.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029331",
