  "text": "72 4 Brief Survey of Cognitive Architectures\n\nas to include an implicit “cup versus bow!” classifier, whose inputs are the outputs of some of\nthe nodes in the higher levels of the perceptual network. This classifier belongs in the action\nnetwork because it is part of the procedure by which the DeSTIN system carries out the action\nof identifying an object as a cup or a bowl.\n\nThis example illustrates how the learning of complex concepts and procedures is divided\nfluidly between the perceptual network, which builds a model of the world in an unsupervised\nway, and the action network, which learns how to respond to the world in a manner that will\nreceive positive reinforcement from the critic network.\n\n4.3.2 Developmental Robotics Architectures\n\nA particular subset of emergentist cognitive architectures are sufficiently important that we\nconsider them separately here: these are developmental robotics architectures, focused on con-\ntrolling robots without significant “hard-wiring” of knowledge or capabilities, allowing robots\nto learn (and learn how to learn, etc.) via their engagement with the world. A significant focus\nis often placed here on “intrinsic motivation,” wherein the robot explores the world guided by\ninternal goals like novelty or curiosity, forming a model of the world as it goes along, based\non the modeling requirements implied by its goals. Many of the foundations of this research\narea were laid by Juergen Schmidhuber’s work in the 1990s [Sch91b, Sch9la, Sch95, Sch02], but\nnow with more powerful computers and robots the area is leading to more impressive practical\ndemonstrations.\nWe mention here a handful of the important initiatives in this area:\n\ne Juyang Weng’s Dav [IIZT* 02] and SATL [WIZ* 00] projects involve mobile robots that\nexplore their environments autonomously, and learn to carry out simple tasks by building up\ntheir own world-representations through both unsupervised and teacher-driven processing\nof high-dimensional sensorimotor data. The underlying philosophy is based on human child\ndevelopment [WT106], the knowledge representations involved are neural network based,\nand a number of novel learning algorithms are involved, especially in the area of vision\nprocessing.\n\ne FLOWERS [BO09], an initiative at the French research institute INRIA, led by Pierre-\nYves Oudeyer, is also based on a principle of trying to reconstruct the processes of devel-\nopment of the human child’s mind, spontaneously driven by intrinsic motivations. Kaplan\n[Kap08] has taken this project in a direction closely related to our own via the creation\nof a “robot playroom.” Experiential language learning has also been a focus of the project\n[OK06], driven by innovations in speech understanding.\n\ne IM-CLEVER|, a new European project coordinated by Gianluca Baldassarre and con-\nducted by a large team of researchers at different institutions, is focused on creating software\nenabling an iCub [MSV ~ 08] humanoid robot to explore the environment and learn to carry\nout human childlike behaviors based on its own intrinsic motivations. As this project is the\nclosest to our own we will discuss it in more depth below.\n\nLike CogPrime, IM-CLEVER is a humanoid robot intelligence architecture guided by intrin-\nsic motivations, and using hierarchical architectures for reinforcement learning and sensory ab-\n\nlhttp://im-clever.noze.it/project /project-description\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012988",
