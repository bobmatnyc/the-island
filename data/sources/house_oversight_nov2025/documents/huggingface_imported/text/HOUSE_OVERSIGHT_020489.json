  "text": "30\n\nOrigins and Structure\n\nFrom the 1950s to the 1970s, when the United States maintained an alliance with the\nregime of Chiang Kai-shek on Taiwan, pro-PRC organizations faced challenges gaining\ntraction in the United States. During the 1950s, the FBI, aided by pro-Kuomintang security\norganizations, closely monitored their activities and participants. This antagonistic state\nof affairs began to change after President Nixon’s historic trip to China in 1972.'On\nFebruary 24, 1973, more than forty Chinese on the East Coast, most of them immigrants\nfrom Taiwan, established the Washington Association to Promote China Unification to\nhelp advocate for Beijing’s official positions. One of the founders was a professor at the\nUniversity of Maryland who was actively involved in organizations that already supported\nChina’s position on Taiwan and Tibet.? However, a more beneficial contribution came\n\nin the form of advancing US-China scientific, educational, and cultural exchanges that\nstarted to be promoted by a growing number of preeminent Chinese American scientists,\nengineers, and academics who were also advising the Chinese government to launch\nreforms in science and education. These Chinese Americans were also personally helping\nthem establish various programs to bring thousands of talented Chinese students to\nAmerican institutions of learning.\n\nRecognizing the achievements, influence, and growth of the Chinese diaspora, Beijing\nundertook a systematic program designed to target and exploit overseas Chinese\ncommunities as a means of furthering its own political, economic, and security interests.\nThe Beijing government used specialized bureaucracies to manage what it called “united\nfront” activities abroad. Organizations such as the Overseas Chinese Affairs Office inside\nthe Communist Party Central Committee’s United Front Work Department? and the State\nCouncil’s Taiwan Affairs Office led the charge. Almost all of these agencies have established\nnongovernmental fronts overseas, including the China Council for the Promotion of\nPeaceful National Reunification, the China Overseas Exchange Association, and the China\nOverseas Friendship Association.* Other “united front” organizations, such as the Chinese\nEnterprise Association and other Chinese chambers of commerce, are almost always linked\nboth to the United Front Work Department and to the Ministry of Commerce.\n\nFollowing the violent crackdown on the prodemocracy movement in Beijing on June 4,\n1989, the Chinese Communist Party redoubled its efforts to reach out to overseas Chinese.\nMany members of these communities had supported the student democracy movement,\nproviding funds and safe havens for fleeing dissidents. But senior Chinese leader Deng\nXiaoping was not dissuaded. In 1989 and again in 1993, he spoke of the “unique\nopportunity” overseas Chinese offered the PRC. Deng insisted that by drawing on their\nhelp, China could break out of international isolation and improve its international\npolitical standing. Gaining influence over overseas Chinese groups in order to “turn them\ninto propaganda bases for China” became an important task of overseas Chinese united\nfront work.*\n\nThe Chinese American Community\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020489",
