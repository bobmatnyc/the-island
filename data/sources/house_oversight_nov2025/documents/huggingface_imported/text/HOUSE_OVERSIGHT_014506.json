Commercial ver-\nsions of the powder also are avail-\nable for sale online.\n\nRecipients of Winston’s letters\nwere mainly witnesses who might\ntestify against Winston in her law-\nsuit against Scotiabank, and also in-\ncluded U.S. Magistrate Judge Ruth\nMiller, the legal counsel for Scotia-\nbank and Winston’s former counsel\nin her suit against Scotiabank, ac-\ncording to prosecutors.\n\nBecause the envelopes had a\nreturn address of the U.S. Court-\nhouse on St. Thomas, “despite the\nfact that Winston was serving these\nsubpoenas herself,” some of the en-\nvelopes that could not be delivered\nwere returned to the courthouse and\nopened by staff there, according to\nprosecutors.\n\n“Believing the powder to be an-\nthrax or some other deadly biologi-\ncal toxin, the United States Court-\nhouse was evacuated and closed;\n\nIN STOCK\n\nPS4 - XBOX ONE S - Wil U - VITA & NEW 3DS XL & CASES\nGAMES, ACCESSORIES, CONTROLLER.\n\nVITA SD CARDS, SPECIAL ORDERING AFTER REGISTRATION\n\nGeSMedicine\nquoppe’S\n\nPHARMACY\n\nthe employees in the courthouse\nwho were exposed to the powder\nwere quarantined for hours,” ac-\ncording to the filing.\n\nThe incident caused significant\ndisruption at the courthouse and at\nthe private law office of attorney\nBennett Chan near the West Indian\nCo. cruise ship dock.\n\n“The purpose of lacing these en-\nvelopes with hotfoot powder was to\ninstill fear and intimidation in the\nwitnesses to prevent their testify-\ning against Winston,” according to\nprosecutors’ filing.\n\nThe filing does not indicate how\nauthorities determined the sub-\nstance in the envelopes was hotfoot\npowder or what ingredients were in\nthe powder.\n\nWinston admitted to FBI in-\nvestigators shortly after the enve-\nlopes were received that she was\nthe sender. But Villegas has filed a\nmotion to suppress all of her state-\nments to law enforcement, saying\nshe was not properly advised of her\nright to avoid self-incrimination.\n\nBut prosecutors shot back in\nMonday’s filing, saying there is no\nevidence in a video-recorded inter-\nview with Winston that authorities\ndid not properly advise her of her\nrights or attempt to intimidate her\nto give a statement in any way.\n\nVillegas wrote in his motion that\n“the videotaped interview speaks\nfor itself.”\n\nHowever, prosecutors wrote that\n“the most cursory view of Winston’s\nvideo recorded interview with law\nenforcement agents establishes be-\nyond cavil that Winston was never\ncoerced, was properly and repeat-\nedly advised of her rights, and\nconsciously waived those rights,”\naccording to Monday’s filing. “The\nfirst thirty seconds of the interview\nwholly defeats Winston’s meritless\nmotion.”\n\nWinston is scheduled to go to\ntrial on Jan. 11 before U.S. District\nJudge Juan Sanchez.\n\n— Contact Suzanne Carlson at\n340-714-9122 or email scarlson@\ndailynews.vi.\n\nHavensight Mall, Bldg 4, St. Thomas\n(340) 776-1235\nOpen Monday - Saturday ¢ 9am - 6pm\n\nThe Virgin Islands Daily News 9\n\nwekeo,, Inter — ioe aes inc. ako.\nerry Schedule a\n\nTortola i\n\nDeparts Red Hook / St. John Day West End, Tortola\n7:15 a.m. / Non-Stop Mon - Sun 8:00 a.m.\n\n8:00 a.m. / 8:30 a.m. 9:15 a.m.\n11:00 a.m. / 11:30 a.m. 12:15 p.m.\n3:00 p.m. / 3:30 p.m. 4:15 p.m.\n\n4:00 p.m. / 4:30 p.m. Sun 5:15 p.m.\n\n4:30 p.m. / Non-Stop Mon - Sun\n4:30 p.m. / 5:00 p.m. Fri\n\nMon - Sun\nMon - Sun\nMon - Thurs, Sat\n\n5:30 p.m.\n\nVirgin Gorda\n\nThursdays & Sundays\nDeparts Red Hook, St. Thomas Departs St. John\n8:00 a.m. 8:30 a.m.\n\nDeparts Virgin Gorda\n3:00 p.m.\n\nAnegada\n\n1st Sunday of Month (by reservation only)\nDeparts Red Book, St. Thomas Departs St, John\n7:30 a.m. 8:00 a.m.\n\nDeparts Anegada\n4:00 p.m.\n\nDeparts Red Hook, St. Thomas\n8:00 a.m. (Fri & Sun)\n\n2:00 p.m. (Fri)\n\n4:00 p.m. (Sun)\n\nDeparts $t.
