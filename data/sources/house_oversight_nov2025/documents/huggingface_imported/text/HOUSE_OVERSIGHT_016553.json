The Larkin item is OK. The appeal by Brindell re 144 Wells\nRoad should not be on the agenda. The sod/seed item is an item that Tim Frank is working on but I don't\nthink it's an agenda item. We need to check with Peter on that one. The infrastructure of large homes is\nnot an agenda item. Neither is the Trump appeal for 515 North County Road.\nTwo things that will be added though are: EAR Amendments and Zoning Study Items.",
