  "text": "From Inclusive Fitness to Spiritual\nStriving\n\nThe notion of “selfish genes”\n(and, by extension, selfish organisms)\nwas popularized in Richard Dawkins’\n1976 book by that title. Not long\nafterwards, an article appeared in\nScience that presented evidence that the\nmost vicious members of a warlike tribe\nin South America had the most wives\nand children. The underlying notion was\none of (genetic) survival of the fittest:\nThose warriors who were particularly\nvicious were more likely to contribute\ntheir genes to the gene pool.\nMethodological objections have left this\nan open question, however, and new\nevidence now exists that calls this\ninterpretation into question (1): the most\naggressive warriors may have more\nchildren but they have /ower indices of\nreproductive success than their milder\nbrethren in part perhaps because the\nmost aggressive warriors and their\noffspring are also more likely to be the\ntargets of revenge killings. These new\ndata are entirely consistent with John\nCacioppo’s argument that the content of\nthe human gene pool has more to do\nwith the reproductive success of one’s\noffspring than one’s own reproductive\nsuccess. Cacioppo argued further that\nthis genetic selection resulted in a social\nbrain that seeks meaning and connection\nwith individuals and with social entities\n(e.g., groups) that extend beyond other\nindividuals.\n\nIn the next chapter, theologian\nDon Browning also embraces the\nconcept of inclusive fitness and, through\nthe writings of Thomas Aquinas, shows\nhow religion serves the human need for\nmeaning and connection through the\nethics they advocate, the congregations\nthey form, the institutions they represent\nand the God they serve. In his view,\n\n?\n\nPage |30\n\nreligion serves to extend love and\nconnection beyond kin. He further\nargues that new developments in the\nsciences and long-standing traditions in\ntheology constitute fertile ground on\nwhich to build new and testable\nhypotheses regarding our fundamental\nhuman nature.\n\n1.
