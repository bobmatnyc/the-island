  "text": "correspond if the observer were doing\nthe same thing. Another way to say this\nis that there is a resonant response in an\nobserver’s motor system to observing a\nbehavior and this may potentiate a\ndegree of social coordination and\nconnection, as discussed in Semin’s\nchapter. This kind of neural resonance\nhas been shown to play a role in\nunderstanding speech when seeing a\ntalker’s mouth move, even if the listener\ndoes not actually make any mouth\nmovements.\n\nMirror neurons demonstrate that\nobserved action can produce a resonant\nresponse in an observer’s brain. Seeing\na talker’s mouth move creates a motor-\nresonant response that aids in\nunderstanding speech sounds. However,\nthese two observations are very different\nfrom the idea that the meaning of\nsentences can create a resonant response\nin the listener’s brain. In the case of\nspeech, mouth movements are the\nactions that create speech. This might\nseem like a very special case. The\ntraditional linguistic view of language is\nthat words and sentences are symbolic:\nLanguage describing action is not action\nitself. Language describing emotion is\nnot the emotion itself. The entire\nconcept of a symbol is that a symbol\ndenotes something, stands for\nsomething, but the symbol is not the\nthing itself. But it now appears that this\nlong-held notion may be wrong.\n\nThe idea that seeing an object or\nevent gives rise to brain states that\nresonate with previous experiences of\nthat thing suggests a mechanism for\nlanguage understanding to go beyond\nsymbolic interpretation. Given that there\nis a brain mechanism for re-experiencing\nactions or sensations, this same\nmechanism may operate even when\nthere is just a symbolic linguistic\n\nPage |70\n\ndescription. Understanding language\nmay take place by invoking such\nresonant past experiences in the brain.\n\nFor example, when listening to\nsentences about hockey action, hockey\nplayers show neural activity in their\nmotor system which is not seen for\npeople who are naive to hockey.’\nExperience playing hockey recruits the\nmotor system in service of\nunderstanding hockey sentences as if\none were watching or playing hockey\nwhen only listening to speech. This\nsuggests one way in which language can\nhave a direct impact on a listener.\nRather than making inferences about\nactions based on the meanings of\nsentences, understanding a sentence may\nbe a resonant motor system response in\nthe listener to a description of an action.\nIf this idea is extended more broadly,\nlanguage impact may come from such\nresonant responses. Language\nunderstanding and the impact of\nlanguage may result from processes\nmore similar to the effects of hearing\nlaughter. Hearing a sentence may create\nin a listener a set of resonant responses\nvery similar to the patterns that\ncorrespond to the actual situations being\ndescribed.\n\nSuch resonant responses need not\nbe confined to the motor system and\nactions. Emotions such as fear or joy\nmay be empathically evoked in listeners\nby speech just as a scream or laughter\nmight. Verbal expression of attitudes\nmay produce similar attitudinal\nresponses in listeners. Moreover, if a\nlistener’s resonant response is strong,\nthere may be increased empathic overlap\nwith the speaker, which may serve to\nincrease social connection. To the\nextent that people speak together and\nshare feelings, social connection may\nincrease as well.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021316",
