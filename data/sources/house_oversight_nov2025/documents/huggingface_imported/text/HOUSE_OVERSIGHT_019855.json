  "text": "you win, you can bring a car full of friends—and eventually we’re cleared for takeoff. Once\ninside we lose each other in the darkness and pulsating Caribbean music. | get home at\n5:00am, pack my three huge suitcases and rush off to the private airport in Van Nuys, still\nwondering how | could have missed “Moonlight”’s triumph. Why couldn't | see the forest\nthrough the trees? | must have been in La La-land.\n\nXOXO,\nPeggy\n\nP.S. The following weekend | arrive in the Dominican Republic at Casa de Campo at the home\nof sugar baron Pepe Fanjul and his wife Emilia. Juan Carlos, the past king of Spain, wants to\nwatch a few movies with me. | pulled a dozen DVDs out of my bag and say, \"Your Majesty,\nwhich one\"? He says, \"First, \"La La Land\" for fun, then \"Moonlight\" because it won, then \"The\nFounder\" for American ingenuity.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019855",
