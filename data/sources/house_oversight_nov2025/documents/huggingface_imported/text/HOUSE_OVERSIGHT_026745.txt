Dear Jeffrey,

Huge thanks for giving BBB another chance!!We have 200 quite fantastic young women
including a minister, an ambassador-Lisa! a professor -your Anna!-a princess-Sofia! and
the other 196

are doing pretty good as well...lots of young girls in Sweden now dream of joining
BBB...we really build something

unique and worthwhile!! Young dean at Stockholm School of Economics is an idiot to
through it all out but

now its time to develop it smartly! | will be doing a famous Summer radio program in a few
weeks in Sweden,

1 million listeners...among other things, | will talk about the girls..(and my blind date long
ago with a Donald

Trump..ha ha!) Anyway, please see details for the money transaction below - Edyta is my
banker ann a super

person! - | am leaving tomorrow night if anything? Also, if you send me a cell phone
number, | can start sending

you photos from BBB, much easier than e-mail.

TACK sweetheart for continuing believing in BBB! Kram BE
