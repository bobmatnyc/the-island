  "text": "five. This record appeared to have had little impact on the nation’s dominant global\nposition; it did little to unnerve a comfortable sense of national destiny.\n\nMuch of our current confidence can be measured by the astonishing degree to which\nwe embrace the scrambling of even the most elemental parts of our lives, from how\nwe bank to how we drive. Most societies in the past were largely terrified of\ndisruption. If you had arrived in prosperous 17 century Holland and proposed to\n“disrupt agriculture,” or radically change people’s banking habits, you would have\nbeen lynched. Our age is different. Many of the most unsettling forces in our world\nare ones we encourage, feed and push along. If I had said to you a decade ago - “I’m\ngoing to record all of your movements so you can spend less time in traffic.” - is that\nreally a deal you would have accepted? But if you use a GPS mapping system on your\nphone, you have. That Orwell's sick prognostication of technocratic life would be\none you'd embrace? That it would describe a desireable feature of network life?\n“You had to live - did live, from habit that became instinct - in the assumption that\nevery sound you made was overheard, and ... every movement scrutinized.”*° If I\nhad told you we were going to build a world wide high-speed data system that\nwould, as a side effect, make it simple for children in London to connect with, learn\nfrom and then join terrorists in Syria - would you have thought that wise?\n\nThe optimistic bumper sticker of our age - that any disruption is good disruption -\nmarks a wonderful feature of the American character. It is, perhaps, to be expected\nof a nation built by immigrants who overturned their own lives in the hopes of\nsomething better. To pull up and leave home for a land where you did not speak the\nlanguage, knew little of the culture, and faced a blank sheet of the future, demanded\nfaith. You had to believe too: Any disruption is good disruption. But no nation, even\nthe most heroically hopeful, is immune from the forces of history. Edmund Burke’s\nold line, that “every revolution contains within it the seeds of evil,” runs like a\ncounterpoint through the hopeful music of the age now. America’s remarkable spirit\ndoes not make the demand for a national outlook, for an American grand strategy,\nany less real. We’re starting to be aware of just how dangerous this age can really\nbe. In many ways, our very confidence and sometimes blindly certain feeling of\ndestiny probably makes it even more essential that we have a sense, as we rest in\nSilicon Valley or Iowa or wherever, of where we are going, and why.\n\nThe phrase “grand strategy” is one that carries a particular meaning when we think\nabout problems of global balance. It means the way in which ail of a nation’s\npowerful tools of economics, finance, ideology, politics, and other resources can be\nused, together, in the service of security and prosperity.5!
