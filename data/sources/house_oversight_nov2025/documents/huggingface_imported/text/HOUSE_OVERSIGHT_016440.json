(AM)\n\n“Our investigation had discovered at least one of her websites and I am enclosing\nsome examples ... the site goes on to detail, including photos, her apparent\nfascination with marijuana, ’’ Dershowitz wrote in an undated letter to Recarey.\nHe also disputed the claim that one of the defense team’s private investigators\nhad misrepresented himself as a police officer.\n\nRecarey stood his ground.\n\n“His attorneys showed us a MySpace page where one of the girls was holding a\nbeer in her hand, and they said, ‘oh look, she is underage drinking,’ ”’ Recarey\nrecalled. “Well, tell me what teenager doesn’t? Does that mean she isn’t a victim\nbecause she drank a beer? Basically, what you're telling me is the only victim of a\nsexual battery could be a nun.”\n\nKrischer and the lead state prosecutor on the case, Assistant State Attorney Lanna\nBelohlavek, began to dodge Recarey and Reiter’s phone calls and emails, and they\ndragged their feet on approving subpoenas, Reiter and Recarey said.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016440",
