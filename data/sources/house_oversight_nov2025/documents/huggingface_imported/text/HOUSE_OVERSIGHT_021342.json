Other\nminds likewise tend to be relatively\ninvisible unless attention is specifically\ndrawn to them. For instance, take a\nmoment to think about how happy you\nare compared to the average American...\nNo really, please take a moment...If you\njust spent some time thinking about how\nhappy you are and no time thinking\nabout how happy the average American\nis, then you are no different from the\nmajority of people in psychology\nexperiments who do likewise*. People\ncan consider others’ thoughts, feelings,\nbeliefs, or emotions, but doing so\nrequires mental effort that is in short and\nlimited supply. Consider, for instance, a\nsimple experiment in which you are\nplaying a game with another person’.\nBoth you and the other player in this\ngame must first choose privately to\ncooperate or compete with each other. If\nyou both choose to cooperate, you both\nearn $5. But if the other player chooses\nto cooperate and you choose to compete,\nthen you win $10 and your partner gets\nnothing. If you, however, choose to\ncooperate and the other player chooses\nto compete, you win nothing and your\npartner wins $10. If you both choose to\ncompete, you both win a measly $2. It\nseems obvious in this situation that you\nshould consider both what you would\nlike to do, but also consider what the\nother player is likely to be thinking.\nExperimental evidence suggests that\npeople do indeed think about the former\nbut spend little time thinking of the\nlatter. In a basic version of this\nexperiment, 60% of people chose to\ncooperate. However, when people were\nsimply asked to think about their\n\nPage | 96\n\npartner’s thoughts before making their\nchoice, only 27% chose to cooperate. If\npeople had already been thinking about\nothers’ thoughts, as it seems like they\nwould naturally be doing in this\nsituation, then a simple instruction to\nconsider others’ thoughts would have no\neffect on people’s own behavior. That is\nnot the case. This simple experiment\nshows that people may not naturally\nconsider other minds even when it\nappears that they should. Thinking\nabout other minds requires attentional\neffort. It does not necessarily come\nautomatically. Indeed, as Tanya\nLuhrmann describes in her chapter,\npeople may have to work very hard to\ndiscern other minds, such as the mind of\nGod, even when they are actively\nlooking for them.\n\nSeeking. If seeing other minds\nrequires attention, then other minds are\nespecially likely to become visible when\npeople are motivated to think about\nthem. There are many reasons why\npeople might try to get into the mind of\nanother agent, from a spouse to a pet to a\ngod, but two are reasonably well-\nsupported by existing research. First,\npeople tend to think about other minds\nwhen they are trying to form a social\nconnection with others. '° Making\npeople feel lonely or isolated, for\ninstance, increases the tendency to\ndescribe one’s pet as thoughtful,\nconsiderate, or sympathetic (all mindful\ntraits). And those who are made to feel\nlonely are also likely to report believing\nin mindful supernatural agents, such as\nGod. Second, people tend to think about\nother minds when they are trying to\nachieve some understanding and control\nover their environment or over another\nagent’s behavior.’ Concepts of mind,\nincluding attitudes, beliefs, goals, or\ndesires, can provide compelling cause-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021342",
