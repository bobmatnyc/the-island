They're not going to like\n\nMs. Giuffre, and they're going to hold it against her, not\nbecause it has some technical reputational aspect to it, but\nbecause it is something that shows she's a bad person. Under\n\n403, the evidence should be excluded.\n\nLet me give you a second illustration of reputational\n\npoints. They say, \"Ah-ha, look. Ms. Giuffre went to\n\nDr. Kliman,\" and I believe your Honor referred to that as well.\n\nAnd your Honor asked, I think, a very good question, and let me\n\nsee if I can answer that question.\n\nYou said, \"Well, why did she disclose all this stuff\n\nto Dr. Kliman?\" Well, the answer is obvious, she was under\n\ninstructions from\n\nand of course she\n\nthat happened. S\n\nthe doctor to tell everything\n\nthat happened,\n\ntold, to the best of her abilit\n\nome of the stuff is going\n\nty, everything\n\nto turn out in a\n\ncourt of law to be relevant, some of this stuff in a court of\n\nlaw is going to turn out to be irrelevant. But that's not the\n\npsychiatrist's job to say, 'No, no, no, don't talk about\n\nbecaus\n\nillegal drug us the prejudicial effect outweighs the\n\nprobative value,' he just gets a full medical history. And\n\nhaving collected all that information, you know, through\n\nDr. Kliman, or they also have Dr. Miller who did a similar sort\n\nof thing. Now once you have all of this vast array of\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011376",
