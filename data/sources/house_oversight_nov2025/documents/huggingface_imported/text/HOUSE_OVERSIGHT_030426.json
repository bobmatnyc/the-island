  "text": "﻿CONFIDENTIAL\nISSUES OF REPUTATION\nFor the purposes of this discussion, here are the principal objectives:\n• Minimise any mentions in the tabloid press in the UK and US\n• Steadily to restore your profile in select media, political and philanthropic\ncircles\n• Establish you as a pioneering supporter of science and technology with a\nfocus on the less fashionable but most important disciplines\n• Consider some kind of annual event which brings together your business\nand philanthropic interests\nTabloid press attention\nIt is imperative that this be tackled as a matter of urgency, particularly in the UK\nwhich generates so much of the follow up coverage in the US, but also comes to\nthe fore in the most cursory Google search of your name.\nSince it is an unambiguous objective of the Daily Mail and Mail on Sunday to take\ndown Prince Andrew, it is disastrous for you to be seen in any way to facilitate his\nlifestyle, or to help with his well documented issues. Their sole interest in you and\nGhislaine is as a means to attack Prince Andrew and Sarah Ferguson. You need\nto studiously avoid any involvement whatsoever with the couple, which will lessen\nthe interest and we can establish a constructive relationship on your behalf with\nthem. In the fullness of time, it will be possible to run a positive piece about your\nphilanthropy.\nAs for the US tabloids, much of what they have published took the lead from the\nUK papers and is to do with the Prince Andrew/ Sarah Ferguson/ Bill Clinton axis.\nWithout that distraction, it will be easier to maintain a lower profile.\nRestoring your profile\nThe strategy has to be one that is medium term, say 18 months, which starts off\nslowly and intensifies over time, and should not appear to be calculated. We can\ndiscuss in more detail but it should include the following components:\n• “Clean up” Google: Another urgent priority is to retain one of the expert\nfirms in search engine optimization (SEO) to “clean up” the results on all\nmajor search engines where your name is part of a search query. Today,\nwhen anyone types in your name, a majority of the first few pages of the\nresults are references to the charges, to paedophilia, to Prince Andrew,\nto unflattering stories – many of which link back to the Mail websites. We\nhave hired an excellent team of Israeli experts for other clients, and there\nare many firms that claim to be able to optimize results this way but fail to\ndeliver. I cannot overstate the importance of this, because it is the initial\nsource of information on you for many people.\n• Top editors and columnists: These engagements should be informal\nat the outset, and preferably at dinners, lunches and events which aren’t\nbuilt around you. The focus should be on serious business and financial\njournalists who are more interested to hear your opinions on the world\neconomy than to probe tabloid headlines. Those editors and columnists I\ntend to single out are Gerald Baker and Thorold Barker at the Journal,\nLionel Barber and John Gapper at the Financial Times, Andrew Sorkin\nand Hugo Lindgren at the Times, John Micklethwait and Matthew Bishop\nat the Economist, Josh Tyrangiel at Businessweek, as well as a handful\nof international correspondents. Ideally, the first few encounters would be\nat dinners and events that we organize in New York and internationally,\nwhich could be followed by dinners at your house in due course.\n• International political circles: Much more is to be gained by increasing\nyour profile among the international political class than the domestic U.S.\npolitical class. The global nature of your business, the importance of the\ngrowth markets and the puritanism of American politics are good reasons\nfor this. In our view, you should be spending time with European, Middle\nEastern, Asian and Latin American political and business leaders – some\nof which you of course already do on a daily basis but in a concerted way\nthrough such gatherings as, the Ambrosetti Forum, the Abu Dhabi Media\nSummit, Bilderberg and the BRICS Summit. I see that you are part of the\nTrilateral Commission and this is in a similar vein. The advantage offered\nby these gatherings over private meetings is that it demonstrates vividly\nto all the other opinion leaders the unique position you occupy among the\ninternational business elite.\nScience and technology\nThe passion and commitment you have for supporting scientific and technological\nresearch is extremely helpful in two ways. First, when spending time with editors\nand columnists, it is important to focus their attention on areas of your choice, not\ntheirs. Not only is your funding of these disciplines an interesting subject, but the\nspecial rapport that you enjoy with a number of outstanding scientists. This helps\nto showcase your unique position, and acts as a powerful character reference, as\ndid the Alan Dershowitz quotes in your 2005 Vanity Fair profile.\nSecond, since it is intrinsically difficult for people to understand the nature of your\nbusiness, it is all the more important that there is an aspect of your life that is well\nunderstood and which can be proactively communicated. Philanthropy can be the\nvehicle for this, and your highly targeted philanthropy even more so, because the\nimpact is quantifiable. A lot can be accomplished with the science and technology\npress in the first instance, who are interested in the serious side to your work and\nare uninterested in the tabloid headlines.\nSome of the necessary steps are:\n• Take down the Jeffrey Epstein Science and Jeffrey Epstein Philanthropy\nwebsites, and build a new site from scratch which explains your interests,\nyour past funding, the scientists you support and the breakthroughs\n• Introduce greater transparency into how you allocate funding in response\nto grant applications\n• Establish a Scientific Advisory Board of the Foundation, which serves to\ndemonstrate the deep knowledge base you draw on and attracts the best\nscientists to apply\n• Sets out quantifiable long term targets, i.e. the Gates Foundation target\nto eradicate malaria by 2015\nAnnual event\nI would advise you to think about some kind of annual event that brings together\nyour business and philanthropic interests, i.e. an intimate and high level summit\nor conference. The best events of this nature clearly demonstrate:\n• The convening power of the host\n• Your interest and expertise in a range of subjects\n• Your network that your clients and acquaintances greatly value\n• The connections made between your guests\n• That you are undaunted by the negative publicity, it is ‘business as usual’\nWhilst different from what I have in mind, the Milken Conference has been a key\npart of Mike Milken’s rehabilitation. This could be a much smaller, more high level\ngathering focused on a subject of interest to these core constituencies.\nOsborne & Partners LLP\n14 June 2011",
