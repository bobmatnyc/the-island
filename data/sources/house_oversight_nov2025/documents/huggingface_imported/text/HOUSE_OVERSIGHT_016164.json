Hospitals would be under pressure to be more flexible on prices to avoid any\npressure should lower-cost packages impact their volumes.\n\nVision implies a long process\nTo us, the government's vision implies a two stage process over a long time-frame:\n\ne Inthe short-term: improve the quality of care offered in the public sector,\npotentially with the assistance of private healthcare\n\ne In the long-term: Only when public facilities have improved, privatise such facilities\n(although one medical city is to be privatised under a public-private partnership)\n\ne Concurrently: Prepare for a roll-out of private health insurance to finance private\nprovision\n\nAbu Dhabi and Dubai are probably not parallels\n\nIn Abu Dhabi and Dubai, private healthcare was encouraged to avoid expats relying on\npublic facilities. The large expat population in proportion to the locals (85:15) supported\nthe creation of private facilities that it was then possible for the governments to fully\nfund Emiratis to use. The quality of public facilities was not a cause for concern - many\nEmiratis still prefer to use government facilities for more serious problems.\n\nExpat population and quality of public system differ in Saudi\n\nThe proportion of expats (33% of the population) is not large enough to drive the\nestablishment of a large, high quality private hospital base sufficient to serve the entire\nSaudi population. Additionally, the quality of both care and infrastructure in the public\nsystem is seen as lacking, suggesting additional investment in facilities is required.\n\nDegree to which private sector will benefit is uncertain\n\nGiven the lack of detail provided to date, it is hard to assess the benefits, or risks to the\nincumbent private hospital operators in detail. We see two main ways the private sector\ncan participate in healthcare reform:\n\ne Win contracts to run and improve public health facilities\ne Benefit from volume growth any roll-out of private health insurance could spur\n\ne Participate in privatisations\n\nIn the long-term, volumes up but pricing down, likely to benefit nonetheless\n\nAt present there is limited supply of quality private hospitals and the incumbents are in\na strong bargaining position with insurers. Greater private hospital supply, and\ncompetition, would likely pressure pricing, and margins in the longer-term, albeit offset\nby increased volumes. Assuming only basic services are offered to most citizens under\nany government-driven scheme, there would still be a place for offering higher-quality\naccommodation for example, to higher-income patients.\n\nPrivate sector could win public hospital contracts\n\nPrivate operators could be allocated management contracts for public hospitals to\nimprove efficiency of existing hospitals, train public sector administrators and raise\nclinical standards. Presumably reimbursement under such contracts would be based on a\nfixed fee, potentially with performance clauses for improved outcomes or lowering\ncosts. More substantive contracts, where the private operator is responsible for all\naspects of operating the hospital could be more accretive, but bring greater financial\nrisk.\n\n54 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016164",
