A variety of viscous and\nunpleasant-looking fluids (yellow, reddish-orange, brown), dry materials (sawdust?\nflour?), and even insects drizzle or dust their way down the head, whose stoic sublimity is\nmade gorgeously virtual on the work’s enormous screens. Dead Imagine, through its\nlarge-scale and cubic “Platonic” form, remains both artificial and locked into the body—\nrefusing a detached “intelligence” as being no intelligence at all.\n\nArtists in the new millennium inherit this critical tradition and inhabit the current\nparadigms of AI, which has slid from partial simulations to claims of intelligence. In the\n1955 proposal thought to be the first printed usage of the phrase “artificial intelligence,”\ncomputer scientist John McCarthy and his colleagues Marvin Minsky, Nathaniel\nRochester, and Claude Shannon conjectured that “every aspect of learning or any other\nfeature of intelligence can in principle be so precisely described that a machine can be\nmade to simulate it.” This modest theoretical goal has inflated over the past sixty-four\nyears and is now expressed by Google DeepMind as an ambition to “Solve intelligence.”\nCrack the code! But unfortunately, what we hear cracking is not code but small-scale\ncapitalism, the social contract, and the scaffolding of civility. Taking away the jobs of\ntaxi and truck drivers, roboticizing direct marketing, hegemonizing entertainment,\nprivatizing utilities, and depersonalizing health care—are these the “whips” that Wiener\nfeared we would learn to love?\n\nArtists can’t solve any of this. But they can remind us of the creative potential of\nthe paths not taken—the forks in the road that were emerging around 1970, before\n“information” became capital and “intelligence” equaled data harvesting. Richly\nevocative of what can be done with contemporary tools when revisiting earlier\npossibilities is French artist Philippe Parreno’s “firefly piece,” so nicknamed to avoid\nhaving to iterate its actual title: With a Rhythmic Instinction to Be Able to Travel Beyond\nExisting Forces of Life (2014). Described by the artist as “an automaton,” the sculptural\ninstallation juxtaposes a flickering projection of black-and-white drawings of fireflies\nwith a band of oscillating green-on-black binary figures. The drawings and binary\nfigures are animated using algorithms from mathematician John Horton Conway’s 1970\nGame of Life, a “cellular automaton.”\n\nConway set up parameters for any square (“cell”) to be lit (“alive”) or dark\n(“dead”) in an infinite, two-dimensional grid. The rules are summarized as follows: A\nsingle cell will quickly die of loneliness. But a cell touching three or more other “live”\ncells will also die, “due to crowding.” A cell survives and thrives if it has just two\nneighbors... and soon. As one cell dies, it may create the conditions for other cells to\nsurvive, yielding patterns that appear to move and grow, shifting across the grid like\nevanescent neural impulses or bioluminescent clusters of diatoms. In Stephen Hawking’s\n2012 film The Meaning of Life, the narrator describes Conway’s mathematical model as\nsimulating “how a complex thing like the mind might come about from a basic set of\nrules,” revealing the overweening ambitions that characterize contemporary AI: “[T]hese\ncomplex properties emerge from simple laws that contain no concepts like movement or\nreproduction,” yet they produce “species,” and cells “can even reproduce, just as life does\nin the real world.” °°\n\nJust as life does? Artists know the blandishments of simulation and\nrepresentation, the difference between the genius of artifice and the realities of what “life\n\n°° Narration in Stephen Hawking’s The Meaning of Life (Smithson Productions, Discovery Channel, 2012).\n\n178\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016981",
