  "text": "Donald Trump’s marriage was perplexing to almost everybody around him—or it was,\nanyway, for those without private jets and many homes. He and Melania spent relatively\nlittle time together. They could go days at a time without contact, even when they were\nboth in Trump Tower. Often she did not know where he was, or take much notice of that\nfact. Her husband moved between residences as he would move between rooms. Along\nwith knowing little about his whereabouts, she knew little about his business, and took at\nbest modest interest in it. An absentee father for his first four children, Trump was even\nmore absent for his fifth, Barron, his son with Melania. Now on his third marriage, he told\nfriends he thought he had finally perfected the art: live and let live—‘Do your own thing.”\n\nHe was a notorious womanizer, and during the campaign became possibly the world’s\nmost famous masher. While nobody would ever say Trump was sensitive when it came to\nwomen, he had many views about how to get along with them, including a theory he\ndiscussed with friends about how the more years between an older man and a younger\nwoman, the less the younger woman took an older man’s cheating personally.\n\nStill, the notion that this was a marriage in name only was far from true. He spoke of\nMelania frequently when she wasn’t there. He admired her looks—often, awkwardly for\nher, in the presence of others. She was, he told people proudly and without irony, a\n“trophy wife.” And while he may not have quite shared his life with her, he gladly shared\nthe spoils of it. “A happy wife is a happy life,” he said, echoing a popular rich-man truism.\n\nHe also sought Melania’s approval. (He sought the approval of all the women around\nhim, who were wise to give it.) In 2014, when he first seriously began to consider running\nfor president, Melania was one of the few who thought it was possible he could win. It\nwas a punch line for his daughter, Ivanka, who had carefully distanced herself from the\ncampaign. With a never-too-hidden distaste for her stepmother, Ivanka would say to\nfriends: All you have to know about Melania is that she thinks if he runs he’ll certainly\nwin.\n\nBut the prospect of her husband’s actually becoming president was, for Melania, a\nhorrifying one. She believed it would destroy her carefully sheltered life—one sheltered,\nnot inconsiderably, from the extended Trump family—which was almost entirely focused\non her young son.\n\nDon’t put the cart before the horse, her amused husband said, even as he spent every\nday on the campaign trail, dominating the news. But her terror and torment mounted.\n\nThere was a whisper campaign about her, cruel and comical in its insinuations, going\non in Manhattan, which friends told her about. Her modeling career was under close\nscrutiny. In Slovenia, where she grew up, a celebrity magazine, Suzy, put the rumors about\nher into print after Trump got the nomination. Then, with a sickening taste of what might\nbe ahead, the Daily Mail blew the story across the world.\n\nThe New York Post got its hands on outtakes from a nude photo shoot that Melania had\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019894",
