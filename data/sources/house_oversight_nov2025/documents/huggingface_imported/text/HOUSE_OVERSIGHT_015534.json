Rather than confer with the victims about the NPA, the U.S. Attorney’s Office\nand Epstein agreed to a “confidentiality” provision in the Agreement barring its disclosure to\nanyone—including Epstein’s victims. As a consequence, the victims were not told about the\nNPA.\n\n16. On July 7, 2008, a young woman identified as Jane Doe No. 1, one of Jeffrey\nEpstein’s victims (other than Giuffre), filed a petition to enforce her rights under the Crime\nVictims’ Rights Act (“CVRA”), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, alleging that the Government failed to\nprovide her the rights promised in the CVRA with regard to the plea arrangement with Epstein.\nThe litigation remains ongoing.\n\ni On or about May 4, 2009, Virginia Giuffre—identified then as Jane Doe No.\n102—filed a complaint against Jeffrey Epstein in the United States District Court for the\nSouthern District of Florida. The complaint included allegations made by Giuffre that pertained\nto Maxwell.\n\n18. In pertinent part, the Jane Doe No. 102 complaint described in detail how\nMaxwell recruited Giuffre (who was then a minor girl) to become a victim of sex trafficking by\nintroducing Giuffre to Jeffrey Epstein. With the assistance of Maxwell, Epstein was able to\nsexually abuse Giuffre for years until Giuffre eventually escaped.\n\n19. The Jane Doe No. 102 complaint contained the first public allegations made on\nbehalf of Giuffre regarding Maxwell.\n\n20. As civil litigation against Epstein moved forward on behalf of Giuffre and many\nother similarly-situated victims, Maxwell was served with a subpoena for deposition. Her\ntestimony was sought concerning her personal knowledge and role in Epstein’s abuse of Giuffre\n\nand others.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015534",
