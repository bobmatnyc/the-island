  "text": "Now, New York friends are suddenly hesitant to talk about Maxwell. \"She's a high-end 'fixer',\" and so what?\nthey ask. \"No one in café society gives a damn that a 15-year-old girl gives massages,\" says one frequent\ncharity-benefit guest. \"She gets people into parties and runs around for a lot of people.\" As to the fallout from\nher association with Epstein, he says, \"If you're Mike Huckabee it would matter but not if you're Ghislaine\nMaxwell.\"\n\nThe crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind\nclosed doors. \"I and many others that know him describe him as brilliant,\" says Siegal. \"His unique mind is\nwhat attracts the world's smartest people to his home.\" Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a\nBreak Fast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner. One\nattendee, Jonathan Farkas, a New York real-estate heir, has known Epstein for 35 years and visited him while\nhe was in prison. \"The side I've been reading about 1s a side I don't know,\" he says. Farkas considers Epstein\none of the smartest people he knows and often asks him for investment advice. \"Unless I've seen it, I don't focus\non it,\" he says.\n\n\"From a cerebral and business side he's worshipped,\" says socialite Debbie Bancroft. \"He's incredibly\ncharming and handsome. He's an extraordinary package so I can see why people don't want to believe what\nthey hear. If people come out of jail and are still successful, people are very forgiving, shockingly so.\"\n\nRenowned scientists whose research Epstein has generously funded through the years also stand by him.\nProfessor Lawrence Krauss, a theoretical physicist and author of Quantum Man, has planned scientific\nconferences with Epstein in St. Thomas and remained close with him throughout his incarceration. \"If\nanything, the unfortunate period he suffered has caused him to really think about what he wants to do with his\nmoney and his time, and support knowledge,\" says Krauss. \"Jeffrey has surrounded himself with beautiful\nwomen and young women but they're not as young as the ones that were claimed. As a scientist I always judge\nthings on empirical evidence and he always has women ages 19 to 23 around him, but I've never seen anything\nelse, so as a scientist, my presumption is that whatever the problems were I would believe him over other\npeople.\" Though colleagues have criticized him over his relationship with Epstein, Krauss insists, \"I don't feel\ntarnished in any way by my relationship with Jeffrey; I feel raised by it.\"\n\nAlexandra Wolfe is a former contributing editor to Conde Nast Portfolio. She has written for publications\nincluding The New York Times, New York magazine, The New York Observer, and The Wall Street Journal,\nwhere she wrote design and lifestyle features for the Weekend Journal section. She is working on a book\ncalled American Coddle, about America's culture of entitlement.\n\nLike The Daily Beast on Facebook and follow us on Twitter for updates all day long.\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom:\nSent: 03 April 2011 12:36\nTo: Peter Green\nSubject: Re: Daily Beast\n\n| cant open anything that is not underlined in blue sorry Peter iam not good at computer stuff.When are you\ncoming here soican call Catherine Crier please nothing to maryanne about thsi jonathan\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021091",
