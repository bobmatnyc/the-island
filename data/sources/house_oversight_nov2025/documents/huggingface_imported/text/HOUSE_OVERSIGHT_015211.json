In 1997, the motion was\ndenied. Attorneys filed an appeal and a motion for a temporary injunction\nrelieving Connection from complying with the act during that appeal. The\nmotion was granted.\n\n“The justice system in this country just makes no sense to me\nwhatsoever,” Patti Thomas tells me. “As far as | know, once we do\npresent our case to the Court of Appeals, if our decision isn’ t favorable,\nwe will make every attempt to go to the Supreme Court. Our attorneys are\nthe best First Amendment attorneys anywhere. Our lawsuit has been very\ncostly, as you can imagine, but our company believes very strongly in\nfighting for our constitutional rights. Our suit was filed not only for the\nbenefit of our company but because we felt that this outrageous law was\ntotally infringing on the civil rights and freedoms of people involved in\nalternative lifestyles. Obviously, the average person involved in swinging\nwould have no way of combating this law on their own.”\n\n| ask her whether attempts at repression have resulted in politicizing\n\nthe swinger community.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015211",
