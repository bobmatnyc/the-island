I listened raptly to\nXi Jinping, general secretary of the CPC\nCentral Committee, when he delivered his\nnew-era-defining report. I heard the\namendment to the Party Constitution that\nenshrined “Xi Jinping Thought on Social-\nism with Chinese Characteristics for a New\nEra”. I watched members of the new Stand-\ning Committee of the Political Bureau of the\nCPC Central Committee walk out on stage. I\nwas awed by the presence of the leadership,\npast and present. And I was overawed by\nXi’s grand vision for China and the country’s\nincreasing, radiating confidence. Most of all,\nI marveled at the remarkable and historic\ntransformation of China, which means so\nmuch to the Chinese people and which in\nthis new era will mean so much to the rest\nof the world.\n\nHaving departed the Great Hall of the\nPeople, I reflected how I, an American,\nfound myself caught up in the welling Chi-\nnese patriotism of the 19th CPC National\nCongress. Certainly, I was experiencing first-\nhand this inflection point in Chinese histo-\nry, when China envisions itself becoming a\nfully modernized country and taking pro-\nactive part in international affairs, and\nregaining its leading seat at the high table of\ngreat nations.\n\nWhat have I just witnessed? Following are\nsome personal observations.\n\nAgeneral consensus describes four pri-\nmary outcomes of the 19th Party Congress:\nXi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chi-\nnese Characteristics for a New Era; a new\n“contradiction” that defines China’s princi-\npal social challenge; a China that takes “cen-\nter stage in the world”; and the Party\nenhancing its leadership of society, includ-\ning maintaining, indeed intensifying, its\nanti-corruption campaign.\n\nTo me, however, a highlight was the speci-\nficity of Xi’s vision of China, not only estab-\nlishing policies for the next five years, but also\nframing the agenda and setting the strategies\nfor the next 30 years. This congress, Xi said, is\nthe “confluence” of the “Iwo Centenary\nGoals”: a moderately prosperous society by\n2020 (2021 being the 100th anniversary of\nthe CPC), which will likely be fulfilled within\nthe term of the 19th Party Congress, and a\ngreat, modern, socialist country by 2050\n(2049 being the 100th anniversary of the Peo-\nple’s Republic of China), which is being\nplanned by the 19th Party Congress.\n\nIna multi-meaning refinement, the path\nto mid-century is now designed in two sta-\nges. In the first stage, from 2020 to 2035, the\nParty states it will build on the foundation of\nthe moderately prosperous society such that,\nafter “15 years of hard work’; the country will\nbasically realize “socialist modernization’:\n\nInthe second stage, from 2035 to 2050, the\nCPC states it will build on a basically achieved\nmodernization, “work hard for a further 15\nyears” and “develop China into a great mod-\nern socialist country that is prosperous,\nstrong, democratic, culturally advanced, har-\nmonious, and beautiful’: China portrays its\nmid-century self as a global leader in every\narea of human consequence: economics and\ntrade, science and technology, military and\ndefense, culture and governance.\n\nBut Chinese leaders, and officials in gener-\nal, seem to have a different highlight. While\nthe “Two Centenary Goals” are certainly vital,\nespecially with new stages and specificity, they\nfocus on the amendment to the Party Consti-\ntution: “Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with\nChinese Characteristics for a New Era”.\n\n“The (Xi’s) thought is the biggest high-\nlight of the 19th National Congress of the\nCPC and a historic contribution to the Par-\nty’s development,” said Zhang Dejiang, the\nthird-ranking member of the Standing\nCommittee of the Political Bureau of the\n18th CPC Central Committee. Liu Yunshan,\nthe fifth-ranking member, said the elevation\nof Xi’s thought to the Party’s guiding princi-\nple is of great political, theoretical and prac-\ntical significance.\n\nI take a closer look at Xi’s thought: first by\nexamining each of its elements, then by con-\nsidering its unified significance.\n\n“Xi Jinping” is the “core” of the CPC Cen-\ntral Committee and of the whole Party, and\nhe thereby at the top level provides the “cen-\ntralism” of the Party’s cardinal principle of\ndemocratic centralism.\n\nThe “Thought” is the totality of Xi’s fun-\ndamental principles. I see four broad cate-\ngories: people orientation, national\nrejuvenation, comprehensive development,\nand Party leadership.\n\nIn his report, Xi listed 14 categories: Party\nleadership over all aspects of society; peo-\nple-centered policies; deepening reform\ncomprehensively; new concept of develop-\nment (innovation, coordination, green,\nopen, and sharing); people as masters of the\ncountry; adherence to rule of law, compre-\nhensively governing the country by law;\nsocialist value system and cultural confi-\n\ndence; protecting and improving people's\nlivelihoods; harmonious coexistence of man.\nand nature (ecological civilization); national\nsecurity; the Party’s absolute leadership\nover the military; “one country, two sys-\ntems” and promoting reunification with Tai-\nwan; international community of a shared.\nfuture for all humanity; and comprehensive\nand strict Party governance.\n\nThe term “thought” in Chinese has special\nmeaning because before this it had been\nassociated only with Mao Zedong — “Mao\nZedong Thought”.\n\n“Socialism” is a set of political ideas with a\ncomplex history, unified by public or com-\nmon ownership of the means of production\nand concern for the masses.\n\n“Chinese characteristics” is the phrase,\noriginating with Deng Xiaoping, that adapts\nMarxism to China’s special conditions — the\nSinicization of Marxism in modern China —\nwhich includes the market playing a decisive\nrole in the allocation of resources and the\nencouragement of non-public, for-profit busi-\nnesses, while at the same time State-owned\nenterprises still playing a dominant role.\n\n“New Era” is a new idea in the constitu-\ntional amendment, and it is designed to\nprofoundly transform the essence of social-\nism with Chinese characteristics into the\nvision, concepts and strategies that com-\npose Xi’s way of thinking.\n\nThe more I reflect, the more I see “New\nEra” as a conceptual lens with which to view\nthe 19th Party Congress. Semi-official Party\nanalysts say the new era answers five ques-\ntions.\n\nhensiveness of the cate-\ngories were clear,\namplified by the commit-\nment to deepen reform.\nHere, by category, are\nwhat stood out.\n\nThe Party and the\nfight against corrup-\ntion. Confidence in\nsocialism and the\nincreasing role of the\nParty in managing all\naspects of the country is unequivocal, and.\nthe increasingly strict governance of the\nParty, by reforming and purifying itself, is\nunambiguous. Moreover, the anti-corrup-\ntion campaign not only continues but also\nwill be enhanced.\n\nEconomy. After more than three decades\nof rapid growth, China’s economy has been\ntransitioning to slower but higher-quality\ngrowth. Supply-side structural reform has\nbeen written into the Constitution. No GDP\ngrowth targets are set. The country focuses\non the real economy (as opposed to specula-\ntion, such as in the real estate sector). China\nis not backing away from State-owned\nenterprises, rather it will support State capi-\ntal in “becoming stronger, doing better, and\ngrowing bigger, thereby turning Chinese\nenterprises into world-class, globally com-\npetitive firms”\n\nConsumption is fundamental in driving\neconomic growth. The framework of regula-\ntions must be improved, prudent macroeco-\nnomic and monetary policy maintained,\nand interest and exchange rates made more\n\nRobert\nLawrence Kuhn\n\n‘Xi said, an example of his plainspoken can-\ndor. “It will take more than drum-beating\nand gong-clanging to get there.”\n\nThe speculations of China watchers, and\nthe focus of the international media, have\nbeen on the new Standing Committee of the\nPolitical Bureau of the CPC Central Commit-\ntee. Because everything in China reports to\nastanding committee member, composition.\nand balance determine the vision, strategies\nand policies that will shape China.\n\nThis remains true today, but less true\ntoday. It is hard to overstate the signifi-\ncance of Xi Jinping’s name written into the\nParty Constitution. Xi is now, officially, the\noriginating designator and overarching\narbiter of “Thought” as it relates to “Social-\nism with Chinese Characteristics for a New\nEra’, which is the guiding political theory of\nChina and encompasses, essentially, every-\nthing in China. For Xi to be named in the\nCPC Constitution is the ultimate in authori-\nty, surpassing even “core” (which already\nhad superseded all other leaders), thus set-\nting into perpetuity Xi’s predominant sta-\ntus and assuring his preeminence in the\ncountry’s political life.\n\nThat said, to know China is to know the\nmembers of the Standing Committee. They\nare a highly competent, highly experienced\ngroup: six of the seven have run provinces\nor province-level municipalities, many of\nwhich, in terms of population and GDP, are\nthe equivalent of major nations.\n\nTraditional norms of balance and age are\nrespected. It’s a diverse group — by geogra-\nphy, education and political career. They\n\nWhat “road” to take? Socialism with Chi-\nnese characteristics under new historical\nconditions.\n\n‘What kind of country to build? First, a\nmoderately prosperous society and then a\nmodernized socialist country.\n\n‘What development to realize? Better life\nand common prosperity for all.\n\n‘What goal to achieve? The great rejuvena-\ntion of the Chinese nation.\n\nWhat contribution to make? Facilitate\nworld peace and prosperity (exemplified by\nthe Belt and Road Initiative of building\ninfrastructure in developing countries).\n\nThus, Xi Jinping joins only Mao Zedong\nand Deng Xiaoping in having his name\naffixed to a political philosophy in the Party\nConstitution, a blazing sign lost on no one.\nIt then would follow that the “New Era” into\nwhich China is now entering is the third era\nof the CPC and by extension of the People’s\nRepublic of China.\n\nAseemingly subtle but significant\nchange is the Party's judgment of what con-\nstitutes the fundamental “contradiction” in\nChinese society. (“Contradiction” is a Marx-\nist term expressing a particular way of\npolitical thinking — dialectical materialism.\n— which identifies “dynamic opposing for-\n\nes” in society and seeks to resolve the\nresulting tensions).\n\nThe principal contradiction has evolved\nfrom one between the ever-growing materi-\nal and cultural needs of the people and\nbackward social production to that between\n“anbalanced and inadequate development\nand the people's ever-growing needs for a\nbetter life,” Xi said. The needs for the people\nto live a better life are increasingly broad\nand have to be met. Not only have their\nmaterial and cultural needs grown; their\ndemands for democracy, rule of law, fairness\nand justice, security, and a better environ-\nment are increasing.\n\nThis “New-Era” contradiction, replacing\nquantitative GDP growth with qualitative\nimprovement of life, is what will drive Chi-\nna’s policy.\n\nThe mission of a CPC congress is to review\nand assess achievements of the previous five\nyears, and to forecast challenges and set tar-\ngets for the subsequent five years (and\nbeyond). Overall, for the 19th Party Congress,\nthe ambition of the goals and the compre-\n\nmarket-based. For economic development,\ninnovation leads, especially in science and\ntechnology.\n\nPoverty alleviation. Xi has made the\nelimination of extreme poverty in China by\n2020 a cornerstone of his domestic policy.\nAfter all, how could China claim to have\nachieved a moderately prosperous society\nby 2020 if millions of its citizens would be\nstill living in extreme poverty?\n\nOpening-up. China reasserts its com-\nmitment to become more open, including\neasing market access and protecting the\nrights and interests of foreign investors.\nChina’s economists see foreign competition\nas upgrading the quality and cost efficiency\nof Chinese companies, thus better serving\nChinese consumers.\n\nRule of Law. Strengthening and institu-\ntionalizing the rule of law, and weakening\narbitrary rule of officials, is a priority.\nReflecting Xi’s commitment, the Party is set-\nting up a central leading group for advanc-\ning law-based governance in all areas,\ncoordinating the activities of judicial\norgans. The goal is to complete the transfor-\nmation of China’s legal system by 2035 with\ntheoretical foundations and practical\nenforcement.\n\nEcology. Beautiful China is one of the\ncountry’s main descriptions for its second\ncentenary goal by the middle of the century.\nThis modernization is characterized by har-\nmonious coexistence between humanity\nand nature (such as nature parks) and it\nrequires substantial bolstering of regulatory\nagencies and their enforcement powers.\n\nArmed forces. China's goal is to trans-\nform the People’s Liberation Army into a\nworld-class military by mid-century, basical-\nly completing military reform and moderni-\nzation by 2035, with information\ntechnology/cyber applications and strategic\ncapabilities prioritized.\n\nEspecially significant for Xi’s mission are\nthe two “anti’s” — anti-corruption and anti-\npoverty — the former to support the Party’s\ncontinuing leadership, the latter as a prime\nexample of what the Party has delivered.\n\nXi does not downplay a realistic appraisal\nof problems, including social imbalances,\nindustrial overcapacities, financial system\nrisks, endemic pollution. “Achieving nation-\nal rejuvenation will be no walk in the park,”\n\nZHAI HAIJUN / FOR CHINA DAILY\n\nhave worked together, in various combina-\ntions, for years. With much now being writ-\nten about each member, I’ll just offer some\npersonal reflections.\n\nFirst, of course, is Xi Jinping, general sec-\nretary of the CPC Central Committee, whose\nprior experience included governor of Fuji-\nan province and Party secretary of Zhejiang\nprovince and Shanghai.\n\nIn 2005, I was advised to study the “Zheji-\nang model” which promotes entrepreneur-\nship to generate economic development. I\nmet Xi, who was then Zhejiang provincial\nParty secretary, and he recommended that I\nstudy China both “horizontally” across\ndiverse regions and “vertically” through the\nhistory of its development.\n\n“To understand our dedication to revitalize\n‘the country, one has to appreciate the pride\nthat Chinese people take in our glorious\nancient civilization,’ Xi said. “This is the histor-\nical driving force inspiring people today to\nbuild the nation. The Chinese people made\ngreat contributions to world civilization and\nenjoyed long-term prosperity,’ he said. “Then\nwe suffered over a century of national weak-\nness, oppression and humiliation. So, we\nhave a deep self-motivation to build our\ncountry. Our commitment and determina-\ntion is rooted in our patriotism and pride.”\n\nBut he cautioned that pride in China’s\nrecent achievements should not engender\ncomplacency.\n\nSecond, premier of the State Council, is\nLi Keqiang, who was Party secretary of Hen-\nan and Liaoning provinces. When I visited\nLiin Liaoning, he explained the complex\nchallenges of revitalizing State-owned\nenterprises while creating a fertile environ-\nment for private businesses. Li shared the\nsame experience of Xi as educated youths in\nthe countryside in the 1970s. The experience\ngave them the chance to know better rural\nChina and the lives of rural people and thus\nfostered their people-orientation.\n\nThe following members are new:\n\nLi Zhanshu, who was governor of Hei-\nlongjiang province and Party secretary of\nGuizhou province, has been director of the\ngeneral office of the CPC Central Committee\nsince 2012.\n\n‘Wang Yang, vice-premier, is former Party\nsecretary of Chongqing municipality and\nGuangdong province. At the height of the\n\nglobal financial crisis in early 2009, he\nargued it was imperative to restructure\nGuangdong’s economy, so that it can move\nup the ladder of industrialization and pro-\nmote more knowledge-based, high-tech, low-\npolluting businesses.\n\n‘Wang Huning, secretariat, is director of\nthe Policy Research Office of the CPC Central\nCommittee. Wang is well known for provid-\ning intellectual vision and sophistication in\nsupport of practical strategies and policies,\nranging from political philosophy to interna-\ntional relations.\n\nZhao Leji, new chairman of the Central\nCommission for Discipline Inspection, has\nserved as head of the CPC Organization\nDepartment, and before that, as Party secre-\ntary of Qinghai and Shaanxi provinces. In\naddition to his responsibilities for Party and\ngovernment officials, Zhao provided strong\nsupport for the poverty-alleviation mission.\n\nHan Zheng is Party secretary of Shanghai.\nUnder his leadership, Shanghai has become\narecognized leader in trade, logistics and\nfinance.\n\nWhat is the impact of all this on China’s\ninternational relations?\n\nThere is no need to speculate. Xi himself,\nin his report, openly and boldly tells all who\nwill listen. China, he says, “has become a\ngreat power in the world” China's global\nengagement is proactive, confident and\ngrowing. Economics and trade drive China’s\npower, exemplified by the much-needed Belt\nand Road Initiative, but diplomacy, the soft\npower of culture and media, and the hard\npower of a blue-water navy projecting power,\nare developing rapidly.\n\nAs Xi said, the new era sees “China moving\ncloser to center stage and making greater\ncontributions to mankind” The country is\nnow offering “Chinese wisdom” and “Chinese\nsolutions” to the international community —\nthe experiences and lessons of China’s\nremarkable development, especially to devel-\noping countries.\n\nRegarding Taiwan, which exemplifies Chi-\nnese sovereignty, Xi painted a bright red line.\n“We will resolutely uphold national sover-\neignty and territorial integrity and will never\ntolerate a repeat of the historical tragedy of a\ndivided country;’ Xi emphasized. “We have\nfirm will, full confidence, and sufficient capa-\nbility to defeat any form of Taiwan independ-\nence secession plot.”\n\nChina has asserted again that it is no\nthreat to any country. No matter how power-\nful China becomes, China’s leaders say it will\nnever seek hegemony or pursue expansion-\nism. Nonetheless, some foreigners remain.\nsuspicious, wary of China’s long-term ambi-\ntions. Who knows future circumstances, they\nworry? Who knows how China may change?\nAlthough I fear self-fulfilling prophecy, I am\nencouraged that China appreciates such sen-\nsitivities and works to build confidence.\n\nThe 19th Party Congress, especially Xi’s\nreport, is an epic narrative of what China has\naccomplished, what China has yet to achieve,\nand what China envisages as necessary to be\na great nation. Xi, now, carries the authority;\nhe also bears the burden.\n\nSetting that new target date of 2035 for\nChina to achieve basic modernization, Xi\nsees China as standing at a new historic\nstarting point and socialism with Chinese\ncharacteristics as exploring new horizons.\nChina has entered a new era and the road\nahead leads, apparently, to great nation sta-\ntus by 2050.\n\nThe author is a public intellectual, interna-\ntional corporate strategist, and China expert/\ncommentator.
