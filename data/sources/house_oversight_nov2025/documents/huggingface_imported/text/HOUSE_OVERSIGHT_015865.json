We simply emerged in a similar but slightly\nmore complex game.\n\nThis proposal would mean our Universe is entirely deterministic,\nour lives the result of a gigantic computer program that we live within\nand form part of. Chaos might make it impossible to predict the future\nwithout running the program and watching what happened, but the\nresults would be inevitable, set in motion at the dawn of time. There is\nno place for free will in such a Universe, no place for reason. The world\nwould simply be.\n\nBut a strange idea will come to our aid to show us the limits of\ncomputation and allow us to question whether we live in a predetermined\nworld. This idea is Aleph 1 - something larger than infinity. And it is\ninfinity we will explore next.\n\n~ Lube\nee te\n1. ty*\n® *\n®\naVh ow” rm a\na . a er\n™ alt oly\nen .\nia he ath,\nii hs 2s\n\nConway's Game of Life\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015865",
