It was\nonly disclosed via a Vice magazine Freedom of Information request in June 2015.\n\nWhat is known is the number of documents that Snowden gave to journalists in Hong\nKong. As will be recalled, Poitras and Greenwald were “writing partners.” When Greenwald\ndiscovered that his copy of the documents were corrupted, Poitras made a copy of the thumb\ndrive that Snowden gave her in Hong Kong and sent it to her Greenwald in Rio de Janeiro by a\ncourier. That courier was intercepted by British authorities at Heathrow Airport. When\nexamined, the Poitras-Greenwald thumb drive contained some 58,000 documents. This meant\nthat the lion’s share of the 1.3 million documents that the NSA claimed were compromised had\nnot been given to journalists and is unaccounted for.\n\nThe numbers game is not only misleading nut unenlightening on the issue of the value of the\ncompromised documents. Many of the putative 1.3 million documents that the NSA says were\ncopied and moved were duplicate copies. Others were outdated or otherwise useless routing data.\nSo the quantity does not tell the story. Of far more importance than the quantity of the total haul\nis the quality of some of the data that Snowden had copied. Just a single one of these documents\ncould cripple not just the NSA but America’s entire multi-billion dollar apparatus for intercepting\nforeign intelligence. The previously-cited summary of requests by the CIA, FBI, Pentagon and\nother agencies for communications intelligence, for example, which was 31,000 pages long, listed\nall the gaps in U.S. coverage of adversaries, including those cited by President Obama’s national\nsecurity team. As Ledgett warned, this single document, if it fell into enemy hands, would provide\nout adversaries with “a roadmap of what we know what we don’t know and imp/licitly a way to\nprotect themselves.” The “roadmap” was not found among the files on the thumb drive. Nor\nwere most of the missing level 3 lists concerning NSA activities in Russia and China found on the\nthumb drive, even though Snowden said he took taken his final job at Booz Allen to get access to\nthese lists. If Snowden had not given these documents to Poitras, Greenwald or other journalists,\nwhere were they?\n\nThe compartment logs showed that Snowden copied and transferred these level 3 documents in\nhis final week at the NSA. He presumably had them in his possession in Hong Kong after he\narrived on May 20, 2013. On June 3™, according to Greenwald, he was still sorting through the\nmaterial to determine which ones were appropriate to give to journalists. On June 12\" 2013, he\ntold reporter Lana Lam in Hong Kong that he was going through the documents, country by\ncountry, to determine which additional ones he should pass on to journalists. Eleven days later, he\ndeparted Hong Kong for Moscow carrying at least one laptop computer. Even after arriving in\nMoscow, he suggested he still had NSA secrets in his possession. \"No intelligence service — not\neven our own — has the capacity to compromise the secrets I continue to protect, “ he wrote to\nformer Senator Gordon Humphrey, “I cannot be coerced into revealing that information, even\nunder torture.\" Much of the material he copied while working at Booz Allen remained, as far as\nthe NSA could determine, missing. Had he brought these files under his “protection” to Russia?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020288",
