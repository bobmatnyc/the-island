Wars are notorious for yielding unintended and unexpected\nconsequences; for reasons explained below, a war against Iran is even\nharder than usual to bound analytically.\n\nComplexity, Uncertainty and War\n\nOur first consideration in analyzing the likely course of war with Iran\nis that a U.S.-led attack would be merely the first phase of a war, the\nopening act of an extended drama whose scenes would unfold, not\naccording to any script, but to an emergent logic of its own. Given\nthe political context in which military engagement would rest, even a\nminor attack would likely become a major test of strength involving\nnot only the United States and Iran but also a host of allies and\nassociates. It is therefore disingenuous to try to frame military action\nagainst Iran as a simple “raid” or even a broader “operation.” We are\ntalking here about war, with attendant potential high costs to all\ncombatants in terms of military casualties, civilian damage and\neconomic disruption.\n\nAt least three concepts are key to any coherent discussion of a U.S.-\nIranian military engagement: complexity, uncertainty and war itself.\nBy complexity we mean the number of moving parts in a given\nsituation: actors, processes and the connections among them. By\nuncertainty we mean structural uncertainty—that is, not just\nignorance of the magnitudes of agreed casual factors, but the\nignorance of the causal factors themselves, and their mutual relations.\nFor example, not only may the U.S. government not know, say, the\ntechnical status of the Iranian nuclear program, or the actual state of\nreadiness of Iranian forces. It may not know (or worse, have wrong)\nthe decision-making and implementation protocols of the Iranian\ngovernment, how the Iranian people and military would react to an\nattack, what Tehran would ask its allies and proxies to do, and what\nin fact they will do.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018104",
