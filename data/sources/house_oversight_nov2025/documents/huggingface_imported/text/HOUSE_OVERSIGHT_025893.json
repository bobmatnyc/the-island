But it is fascinating. BB is making \"historic\nmistakes\"(as he likes to blame others) both vis-a-vis Obama as well as in regard to the American Jewry. And\ncauses a direct damage to IL.\n\nNoam is so sharp and focused. Really impressive.\n\nI did not fully understand how the fallacy he sees in the attitude to the Ants example is related to Big Data\nillusions. An area (deep learning) I spent some time recently trying to better penetrate.\n\nBtw, the series of cubic differences should look 7,19,37,61 (not 21).\n\nWe greatly enjoyed staying in 62nd.\n\nWe plan to be back in the last week of Aug. for several weeks (having some speeches to make)\n\nwill you still be in NM?\n\nIf positive we might come over for few days.\n\nPl let us know.\n\nBest\n\nFrom Nili as well.\n\nRegards\n\nEB\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Aug 8, 2015, at 22:05, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nthought you might find amusing\n\n---------- Forwarded message ----------\n\nFrom: Noam Chomsky a\nDate: Fri, Aug 7, 2015 at 11:57 PM\n\nSubject: RE: Re:\nTo: \"jeffrey E.\" <jeevacation@gmail.com>\n\nNeat indeed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025893",
