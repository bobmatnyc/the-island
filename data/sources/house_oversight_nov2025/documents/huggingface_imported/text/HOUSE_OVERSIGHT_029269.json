We can absolutely agree that we will not give Woody larger or more important billing than\nBill Clinton or Joe Biden, and that I'd like to come to him to renew our agreement after five years.\n\nThe Harvard week of content in which Woody will appear, if we can sign this, needs to be edited in the next\n\nweek-10 days. We are out of time, which is why I'm writing\n\nThe television show has been picked up by American Public Television, they will distribute nationally, and\n\nthey've asked for another 5 episodes. I so want Woody to be one of those.\n\nI'd like to see the haiku written by computer. Haiku is not that hard. I'd like to see an elegy written by\n\ncomputer.\n\nplease note\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\n\nthe use of the addressee.
