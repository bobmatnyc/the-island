  "text": "/ BARAK / 116\n\nthe beginning summed up the feeling of most of the country at the end: “If you\ndon’t win, you lose... Hizbollah survived. It won the war.”\n\nWithout the botched handling of the war, I might well have remained a mere\nmember of the Labor Party and a private citizen. But when the commission of\ninquiry released its report in April 2007, three people were singled out: Olmert,\nAmir Peretz and Halutz. Olmert was portrayed as a military novice who’d gone\ninto battle without understanding the wartime role and responsibilities of a Prime\nMinister. Halutz’s “excess of charisma” was held responsible for keeping\nministers, and military officers as well, from questioning his judgement or pressing\nhim for alternatives. Amir Peretz was found to be the wrong man in the wrong\ncabinet post at the wrong time. Of the three, only Halutz seemed ready to take\npersonal responsibility. Even before the report came out, he resigned. Olmert and\nPeretz were determined to stay put, despite calls to quit not just from the\nopposition but from Tzipi Livni. Inside Labor as well, the war produced a clamor\nfor change. When a vote for party chairman was held in June 2007, I was chosen to\nreturn in Peretz’s place.\n\nWithin days, I replaced him as Defense Minister as well. Yet the main item in\nmy in-box would no longer be Lebanon. I had been briefed a few weeks earlier by\nOlmert on a threat hundreds of miles further away: a construction site in northeast\nSyria, along the Euphrates River, where Mossad had uncovered evidence that the\nSyrians, with technical help from North Korea and funding from Iran, were\nbuilding a nuclear reactor.\n\nI had got to know Olmert fairly well over the years, initially when I was in the\nkirya and both he and another rising Likud politician to whom I became closer,\nDan Meridor, were members of the Knesset’s defense committee. But from the day\nI returned to the Israeli government in June 2007, there was growing tension\nbetween us over dealing with the Syrian nuclear threat. It was not about whether\nwe should take military action to destroy the reactor, before the fuel rods arrived\non site and it could begin producing bomb-ready material. Just as under Menachem\nBegin in 1981, when we’d launched our preemptive strike on Saddam Hussein’s\n\n402\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028250",
