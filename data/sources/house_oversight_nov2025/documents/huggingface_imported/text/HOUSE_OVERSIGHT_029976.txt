Bobby Slayton will be in LA on Sept. 18th (he said if you are hosting Obama in NY though, he could make
the effort to attend)

Below from Bobby re the dinner he would like to have:

> AND Tuesday the 16th is perfect for dinner with David And Lewis And if Woody Makes it GREAT, if not,
always fun to hang with JE!!! David Brenner said he would try to change his flight if only Monday works! !
But the boys are definately in for Tuesday!!!

May I tell Bobby the 16th is good for dinner AND invite Woody?

Lyn & Jojo are back to work on Oct. 16th (they are home on 15th)

Linda Stone will be in NY and staying in an apt Oct. 13-17
