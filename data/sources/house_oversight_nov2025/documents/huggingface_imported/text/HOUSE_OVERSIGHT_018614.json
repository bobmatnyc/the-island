Thanks again to Olivia for being so\nincredibly generous with her time and her thoughts.\n\nte OK ok\n\nA Sugar Baby Leaves The Business\n\nPreviously on Role/Reboot, we ran an interview with my friend Olivia, a 25-year-old\ngraduate student who had just started having sex for money through a \"sugar baby”\nwebsite called SeekingArrangement.com. In the interview, Olivia covered a lot of topics.\nShe mentioned that she usually feels powerful in her relationships with her clients.
