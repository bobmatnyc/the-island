We dug for\nmore than two hours, but still hadn’t found the cable, and our mail-order metal\ndetector stubbornly refused to chirp out any sign of it.\n\nJust when I’d decided to call the helicopter back in to get us, it finally\npeeped a faint signal. I still wasn’t convinced, but as we manipulated it back and\nforth, it got louder. Still, my instinct was to abort. We’d placed the explosives\non the electricity tower and the pipeline. That would at least divert attention\nfrom our real mission, which meant we could return in a few months and have\nanother attempt. After all, the part of the operation that had been causing the\nmost concern in the Airya — our ability to get deep inside Egypt undetected —\nhad succeeded. We were nearly three hours behind schedule. Unless we worked\na lot more quickly than planned, by the time we installed the communications\nintercept and covered our tracks, it would be daybreak.\n\nDigli and several other sayeret officers were following the mission from\ntheir command post in the Sinai, part of the intelligence base our military\nengineers had built after the war into a 2,400-feet-high mountain called Gebel\nUm-Hashiba, 20 miles back from the Suez Canal. When I radioed in to tell him\nI’d decided to abandon the operation, I could hear the surprise in his voice, and\nwhat seemed reluctance as well. “If that’s your judgement...” he said. But\nbefore I could reply that, yes, I felt withdrawal was the wisest course, I heard\nhim speaking to someone whose voice I also recognized: Avsha Horan. He was\nthe soldier on guard duty in the command post for our first intercept operation\nin the Sinai, the one who’d told me of how Rabin was chain-smoking and biting\nhis nails when it appeared we might be in trouble. Now, he was a sayeret\nofficer. Digli came back on the radio. “We can see more from here,” he said.\nThen, pausing, he added: “Avsha says he thinks you can still do it.”\n\nI had grown to respect Avsha’s judgement. And while Digli hadn’t explained\nwhat “more” they saw from the command post, I assumed that, since they were\nalso following the other helicopter teams further south, they were concerned\nthat the Egyptians had figured out at least that Israeli units were involved. Both\nhe and I knew that it ultimately had to be my call. Whatever happened, I’d be\nresponsible. Yet I realized that discussing it further would change nothing, and\ntime was now what mattered most. “We’ll do it,” I told him, and signed off.\n\nWe’d planned for the cable work to take something like five hours, which I\nknew we couldn’t afford. With all of us pitching in, sweat drenching our\n“Egyptian” uniforms, we managed to finish in slightly less than four. But we\n\n106\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011577",
