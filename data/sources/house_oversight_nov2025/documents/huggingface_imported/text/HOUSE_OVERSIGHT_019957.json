Compared to Pussy-gate, Russia seemed like the only-desperate-thing-\nleft-gate. What seemed unfair now was that the issue still wasn’t going away, and that,\nincomprehensibly, people took it seriously. When at best it was ... nothing.\n\nIt was the media.\n\nThe White House had quickly become accustomed to media-led scandals, but they\nwere also used to their passing. But now this one was, frustratingly, holding on.\n\nIf there was any single piece of proof not just of media bias but of the intention of the\nmedia to do anything it could to undermine this president, it was—in the view of the\nTrump circle—this, the Russia story, what the Washington Post termed “Russia’s attack on\nour political system.” (“So terribly, terribly unfair, with no proof of one vote changed,”\naccording to Conway.) It was insidious. It was, to them, although they didn’t put it this\nway, similar to the kind of dark Clinton-like conspiracies that Republicans were more\nwont to accuse liberals of—Whitewater, Benghazi, Email-gate. That is, an obsessive\nnarrative that leads to investigations, which lead to other investigations, and to more\nobsessive no-escape media coverage. This was modern politics: blood-sport conspiracies\nthat were about trying to destroy people and careers.\n\nWhen the comparison to Whitewater was made to Conway, she, rather proving the\npoint about obsessions, immediately began to argue the particulars involving Webster\nHubbell, a mostly forgotten figure in the Whitewater affair, and the culpability of the Rose\nLaw Firm in Arkansas, where Hillary Clinton was a partner. Everybody believed their\nside’s conspiracies, while utterly, and righteously, rejecting the conspiracies leveled at\nthem. To call something a conspiracy was to dismiss it.\n\nAs for Bannon, who had himself promoted many conspiracies, he dismissed the Russia\nstory in textbook fashion: “It’s just a conspiracy theory.” And, he added, the Trump team\nwasn’t capable of conspiring about anything.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nThe Russia story was—just two weeks into the new presidency—a dividing line with each\nside viewing the other as pushing fake news.\n\nThe greater White House wholly believed that the story was an invented construct of\nweak if not preposterous narrative threads, with a mind-boggling thesis: We fixed the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019957",
