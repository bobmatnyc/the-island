  "text": "Norfolk Southern (NSC)\n\nOur $122 price objective is based on a 19.5x multiple on our 2017 EPS estimate of\n$6.25. We move above the top of its one-standard deviation historical trading range of\n12x-16x given the new management team's move to improve margins, cut costs, and\nraise its ROIC, and as EPS inflects off a volume deflated 19% decline in 2015.\n\nRisks to our price objective and estimates are the company's ability to derive continued\noperational benefits, a return to significant pricing competition among the rails, slower\nthan expected economic growth, a deterioration to improving service metrics, a heavily\nunionized employee base, inability to exercise pricing power due to regulatory changes\nor legal challenges from customers, external factors (such as weather) impacting\noperations, and the STB installing mandatory reciprocal switching (or open access) to\nthe rail network without proper pricing.\n\nSVB Financial Group (SIVB)\n\nWe use a three-factor valuation framework (P/TBV, P/E, DCF) to arrive at our $190 price\nobjective and assign a 2.3x multiple to our 2017e TBV and apply a 21x P/E to 17E EPS.\nOur valuation multiples are both in line with high growth peers due to SIVB's high\nprofitability and EPS growth profile. Our DCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of\n9.5% and a terminal growth rate of 6%.\n\nDownside risks are a longer than expected low rate environment and a slowdown in the\ntechnology sector and related IPO activity. Upside risks are sooner than expected rate\nhike, or better than expected pickup in the tech sector.\n\nTexas Instruments Inc. (TXN)\n\nOur $82 PO on TXN is based on14x FY17E EV/EBITDA, in line with high quality\ndiversified and analog peers trading at 14x-15x, given TXN's high quality business model\nand strong FCF generation.\n\nRisks to our price objective: 1} Lumpy telco capex, especially in wireless deployments, 2)\nVolatile market share as design cycle times are very long, 3} Increased R&D spending\npressure to maintain an edge versus the competition, 4) Inventory cycles and potential\ndouble ordering by customers that can often create mismatches between real supply\nand demand, 5) Exposure to several mature markets such as PC and other consumer\nelectronics could limit its growth rate.\n\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\n\nOur price objective of $41 is based on 21x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate. This\nmultiple represents a premium to online travel/vertical media comps and in our view\nadequately compensates TripAdvisor for improving margins and growth off a trough\npoint in FY16 into FY17 when the negative impacts of its IB transition peak.\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing competition (e.g. Yelp), 2} macro-\neconomic factors (e.g. recession in Europe) impacting the travel industry, 3} challenges\nto the credibility of online reviews, 4) Instant Book transition puts pressure on revenue\ngrowth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.\n\nUpside risks to our price objective are: 1) improved mobile monetization 2} major OTA\nsign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved\nglobal macro environment.\n\nAnalyst Certification\n\nWe, Derek Harris, Andrew Obin, Brian Chin, Doug Leggate, Ebrahim H. Poonawala, Ken\nHoexter, Kevin Fischbeck, CFA, Nat Schindler, Ronald J. Epstein, Shaun C. Kelley and\nVivek Arya, hereby certify that the views each of us has expressed in this research report\n\nBankof America <>\nMerrill Lynch Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017. 17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014638",
