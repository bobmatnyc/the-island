Really rett : \ncan't express how happy I am to be here. Totally over the moon every day going to \nand exploring the area. \nNow I'm on the way to Tuscon to visit whose info I sent you for assistant r,osition. She \nwould love to pass interviews with you. She is smart and easy, her mum produced movie so \nknows a lot in film industry too besides other assets. \nWhat happens with zubair's project ? Do you believe it can be used in H.clinton's campaign or the Trump's \none to help her/ him win elections ? His goal is to propose it to them to find out in which states, what \nkind of people should be targeted to collect votes. He says that his algorithms can figure reasons why a \ncategory of people vote against a candidate and to help candidate to adapt the campaign to the people's \npreferences...well, to win elections at the end! \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030630",
