If any party was looking for a\ndisgruntled US employees, Snowden’s Internet chatter about bad choices in gambling could\narouse its interest. That Snowden used his TheTrueHooHa alias for these Internet posting would\nnot prevent a sophisticated espionage organization, such as the Russian Intelligence service, from\nquickly uncovering that his true identity was Edward Snowden. Nor would it be difficult to place\nhim at the CIA since, it will be recalled, he was listed by his true name on the roster of the US\nMission to the UN. By consulting personnel records it would further emerge that he did not\nactually work for the State Department. Since it was no secret, at least to the Russian\nIntelligence services, that the US mission in Geneva housed the CIA station for all of Switzerland,\nit was probable that this brittle gambler who played the options market worked for the CIA. Even\nthough it cannot be precluded that Snowden was spotted in Geneva by another intelligence\nservice, there is no evidence, at least that I know of, to suggest that he was approached by one.\nNor is there reason to believe that if he had been contacted by a foreign service in 2008, he would\nhave responded positively. Despite his indiscreet posting about his outside activities, he\napparently still respected the boundaries of secrecy that had been clearly defined in the oath he\nhad taken in the CIA. For example, after the New York Times published an article revealing\nsecret American intelligence activities in Iran on January 11, 2009, Snowden railed against the\nnewspaper on the Internet under his True HOOHA alias, He wrote “This shit is classified for a\nreason... It’s because this shit won’t work if Iran knows what we are doing.” He clearly\nrecognized that revealing intelligence sources was extremely damaging. As for the New York\nTimes, he said “Hopefully they’ll finally go bankrupt this year.” When another Internet user asked\nhim if it was unethical to release national security secrets, he answered,” YEEEEEEEEEES.”\n\nNevertheless, he had his career-ending problem at the CIA. As with every CIA officer, he had\nto undergo a two year evaluation and take a routine polygraph test. It was then, in December\n2008, that his superior at the CIA placed the “derog” in his file. The reason remains somewhat\nmurky. According to a New York Times story by veteran intelligence reporter Eric Schmitt,\nSnowden’s superior had suspected that Snowden “was trying to break into classified computer\nfiles to which he was not authorized to have access.” Schmitt evidently had well-placed sources in\nthe CIA. He said that he interviewed two senior American officials who were familiar with the\ncase. According to what they told Schmitt, the CIA superior had decided to “send Snowden\nhome.” Officially, however, according to a CIA reply to the New York Times report, Snowden\nhad not been fired or accused of attempting to “break into classified computer files to which he\ndid not have authorized access.” The discrepancy was explained to me by a former CIA officer\nwho had also been at the US Mission in Geneva. He said that the spin the CIA put on the story\nwas “necessary containment.” After the Snowden breach occurred in June 2013, the CIA had a\nproblem which could, as he put it, “blow up in its face.” If Snowden had been fired but allowed\nto keep his secrecy clearance in 2009, the CIA’s incompetency could be partly blamed for the\nNSA’s subsequent employment of him. If he had broken into a computer he was not authorized,\nhe should have been fired, if not arrested. What this spin glossed over, according to this former\nCIA officer, is the part of Snowden’s behavior that concerned his superior. Technically,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020205",
