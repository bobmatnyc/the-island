In fact, | was fully\ncognizant of what an honor it must have been for him.\n\nWhen the incident was over, | simply returned to my desk, and\nalthough the tension of vulnerability was still in the air, we resumed our\ndiscussion as if nothing had occurred.\n\n“Now,” | said in a normal tone of voice, “what' s on the\nagenda?”\n\n“Sir,” Haldeman began, “on this Watergate problem, it would be\nadvantageous to us if any similar activity on the part of the Democrats\ncould be leaked to the media.”\n\n“Well, Hoover once told me—this was right after we won in\n‘ 68—he said that within the previous month, LBJ had the FBI put the bug\non Agnew and me. Ramsey Clark was attorney general then, but he never\nauthorized it, so that was an ///ega/ wiretap.”\n\n“Perfect. We start with Lyndon Johnson and work our way back.”\n\n“But no, on second thought, the LBJ tap would open up the whole\nDragon Lady can of beans. | mean that was the goddamn excuse they had\n\nfor spying on us.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015123",
