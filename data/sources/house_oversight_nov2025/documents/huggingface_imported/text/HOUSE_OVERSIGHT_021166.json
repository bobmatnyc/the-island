  "text": "having such an open conversation about things Jeffrey had never\nexperienced before and he seemed okay with everything I was telling him\nas we were having a good laugh together, so I thought I could push it a bit\nfurther and tell him the truth about T_J, since it was bound to come out\nsooner than later I’d rather not the latter, when it would look even worse\nthat I kept the truth from him for so long.\n\n“Well why were opening up about things together”, 1 continued by\nsaying “I had met someone from my past and we have been hanging out a\nlot lately. When I haven’t been travelling with you I have been with him\nand I was wondering if you minded if | started to see this guy.” He started\nto laugh out loud, “Are you serious? Of course not, no one in this world is\nmonogamous, why would I expect you to be?” 1 was smitten with relief,\nbut a little bit dis-heartened when I heard him speak that way and I\nwondered to myself if he’d had his own personal encounter with\nheartache.\n\nOf course the evening concluded in the same way it always had, the only\nreason I was really even there in the first place. Upon his request I\nstraddled him on top of the table and let him explode with pleasure inside\nof me. Thinking the entire time about T.J, I felt so terrible but I quickly\nhad to wipe the thoughts of guilt from my mind not to give Jeffrey the\nwrong impression. So I had myself busy with two men in my life, but\nthat’s not what I really wanted for myself. | wanted an occupation that\nwould eventually set me free from depending on a man as my source of\nsurvival.\n\nlasked Jeffrey before I left for the evening, when my real training was\ngoing to begin and he liked my assertiveness. I thought it meant to him\nthat I was taking my job with him seriously, but it was all part of his\nmaster plan to keep me by his side. Within a couple of weeks of my\npersistence, Jeffrey introduced me to a couple of real working massage\ntherapists, not only with credentials but with their own clientele too. I\nwas in awe of their teachings, it all made so much sense about the body\nand what they were saying. I felt like I had picked myself up out of the\nlurches and had a direction again.\n\nI was in the middle of another training session, with Jeffrey the\nrecipient as usual, being it was rare for Ghislane to ask for a massage\nunless of course it was for Jeffrey’s own pleasure to watch the punch line\nof the session, when I was shocked to hear Jeffrey ask one of the\ntherapists to now remove her shirt. He had no shame I thought. Even\nthough she was above his usual age criteria, she was still a pretty woman\nin her early 30’s with curly blonde hair and had an athletic body for a\nmother of two children. She didn’t hesitate in his request. It looked like\nsomething out of a role-playing porn scene with the therapist removing\n\n43\n\n1d Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004176\n\nher white uniform to reveal her beautiful nude body and a much darker\nside to her personality.\n\nI couldn’t believe it at first it was such a state of shock and I began to\nquestion t myself if this was normal in the massage profession to expect\nthis kind of clientele to request such degrading tasks even though they\nwere professionals. At the end of the session she was paid $300 dollars an\nadditional hundred for helping to train me as well, and 1 was paid my\nusual! $200 dollars then we were both invited by Jeffrey to join him out\nby the pool for a cool dip. With Jeffrey making a few phone calls while\nher and | undressed again for a swim, | wanted to ask her a few personal\nquestions about what she’s come to learn about the Massage Therapy\ngame, but I never got the chance as we were joined by Ghislane moments\nlater. She was asking how my training was going and booked the\ntherapist in for herself in the following moming. Where she was invited\nback to do another training session with me. It didn’t take me long to\nfigure out why.\n\nI was at my apartment when I received a phone call from Jeffrey, |\nthought it was the usual call to come over to his house, but he surprised\nme. Instead I would be going to the exclusive hotel in Palm Beach\ntonight, The Breaker’s, where I would be meeting my first ever clients.\nOnly told their first names I was given some instructions and the address\nwhere to meet Glen and Eva. They were a married couple with one on the\nway. I was quite concerned when I heard she was pregnant, being I really\ndidn’t know the body that well and didn’t want to inflict any wrong doing\non the unborn baby but Jeffrey insisted I take this job. Just massage her\ngently where she wants to be rubbed and to save all of my energy for\nGlen’s massage, since it was going to be a four-hour job. In an\nemphasized tone of voice I was being coached by Jeffrey to treat Glen\nwith exactly whatever he wanted, just like I do for Jeffrey himself. It was\nmy last bit of preparation before he sent me out to his friends and my first\ntaste of responsibility in upholding his reputation.\n\nAt around seven pm I took a taxi to the address I was given and found\nthem on the residential side of the giant hotel’s extensive property. When\nI arrived in their apartment it was a far cry from the lavish place I was\nexpecting, still really nice but had a cozier family feel to it. It was just\nbeginning to get dark when Eva and I went into the Master Bedroom and\nshe undressed to reveal the first naked pregnant body I had ever seen. It\nwas fascinating to see her in the later stages of maternity, and strangely\nenough it was a miraculous and wondrous sight. She was a former model\nand one of Jeffrey’s many entourages from his past that had gotten to old\nfor his taste and was married off to a wealthy colleague of his.\n\nLying down on the bed I adjusted the pillows to try and make her more\ncomfortable and | began to massage her as Jeffrey had instructed me to,\n\n44\n\n(] Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIULTREO04 177\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021166",
