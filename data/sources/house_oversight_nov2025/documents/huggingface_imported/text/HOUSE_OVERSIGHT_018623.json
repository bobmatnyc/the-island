  "text": "she would have been had she settled down with Barry, the orthodontist, 10 years earlier?\nShe and Ross have passion but have never had long-term stability, and the fireworks she\nexperiences with him but not with Barry might actually turn out to be a liability, given\nhow many times their relationship has already gone up in flames. It's equally\nquestionable whether Sex and the City's Carrie Bradshaw, who cheated on her\nkindhearted and generous boyfriend, Aidan, only to end up with the more exciting but\nself-absorbed Mr. Big, will be better off in the framework of marriage and family. (Some\ntime after the breakup, when Carrie ran into Aidan on the street, he was carrying his\ninfant in a Baby Bjorn. Can anyone imagine Mr. Big walking around with a Bjorn?)\n\nI've never watched Friends or Sex and the City, but I know the feeling.\n\nPersonally, I'm more of a novel girl. The other day, I found myself thinking of my long-\nago roommate and her thoughts on arranged marriage while I read Monica Ali's beautiful\nbook Brick Lane. Monica Ali is an immigrant to the United Kingdom, and the characters\nin her novel all come to the UK from Bangladesh. Some of the characters accept\ntraditional arranged marriages, while others make \"love marriages\" instead -- often\ndefying their parents, their whole set of cultural norms, to do so. Towards the end of the\nnovel, one man reflects on the early days of his marriage:\n\nWe thought that the love would never run out. It was like a magic rice sack that you\ncould keep scooping into and never get to the bottom. It was a \"love\" marriage, you See.\nWhat I did not know -- I was a young man -- is that there are two kinds of love. The kind\nthat starts off big and slowly wears away, that seems you can never use it up and then\none day is finished. And the kind that you don't notice at first, but which adds a little bit\nto itself every day, like an oyster makes a pearl, grain by grain, a jewel from the sand.\n\nAs you can tell, this character is currently unhappy in his \"love marriage.” Of course, the\ngrass is always greener on the other side. What's the difference between the big love and\nthe pearl love? Can they even be compared? Is it like apples to oranges?\n\nBut couldn't all this be a false dichotomy? Who says it's about arrangement versus\nrandomness -- chemistry versus choice? Can we have both? Can we find the big love, and\nnurture that so it develops into the pearl love, too?\n\nMy ultimate conclusion about the Art and Science of Flirting, from my \"studies\" of\npickup artists and also my entire life, is that flirting is all about strategic ambiguity.\nDeliberate uncertainty. Manipulating ambiguity and uncertainty can contribute to many\nintense feelings.\n\nSome people learn this, and decide that the only way to have a relationship with\nchemistry is to include a constant generous dollop of uncertainty about love, loyalty, or\nsomething equally important. These people decide chemistry can only derive from little\npieces of confusion: tiny mismatches that lodge underneath the similarities that bring\npeople together, constantly unsettling, like a prickly burr. But I don't think that's what I\nwant.\n\nAnd after all, S&M creates extraordinary feelings too, but plenty of people do S&M in\nvery controlled circumstances: pre-discussed, with safewords and so on. Arguably, S&M\nis another form of mismatch, of contrast, of uncertainty -- but it's a form that can be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018623",
