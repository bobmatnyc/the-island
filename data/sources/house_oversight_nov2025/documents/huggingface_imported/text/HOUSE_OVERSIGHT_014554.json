Similarly,\nother asset classes such as fixed income provide\nnegligible returns but come with downside risk,\ne.g., if the incoming Trump administration’s fiscal\npolicy is more stimulative than we expect or if the\nFederal Reserve raises interest rates at a more rapid\npace than we expect.\n\nAs we prepared our one- and five-year\nannualized expected returns for this Outlook and\nfinalized our investment recommendations for\n2017, we were struck by two observations.\n\nFirst, the general recommendations and\nvolatility warnings in our Outlook publications\nover the last several years have been similar, have\nbeen directionally correct and have generally\nadded value to our clients’ portfolios. We have\ncontinuously recommended that clients stay\ninvested in their strategic US equity allocation. We\nhave also recommended maintaining some tactical\ntilts such as an allocation to high yield. Yet we\nhave warned clients to be prepared for bouts of\nvolatility. Last year, our exact message to clients\nwith respect to volatility was that “markets will\nbe volatile, so an asset class that performs well in\nthe first half of the year may perform particularly\npoorly in the latter part of the year; however,\ninvestors—unlike traders—should not try to time\nsuch short-term moves.” It is very important that\nclients heed this warning—not just for 2017 but\nfor their entire investing lives.\n\nExhibit 20 illustrates the point. We have\ncompared the performance of some of the best-\nperforming asset classes and sectors for the year\nwith the performance of those assets at their worst\n\nThe general recommendations and\nvolatility warnings in our Outlook\npublications over the last several\nyears have been similar, have been\ndirectionally correct and have\n\ngenerally added value to our clients’\n\nportfolios.\n\nExhibit 20: Returns in 2016\nSome of the best-performing assets in 2016 experienced\nsignificant declines before recovering.\n\nTotal Return (%)\n50 @ Return Through Year-End 2016\n@ Return Through 2016 Low (2/11/16)\n\n12.0\n\n-10\n\n10.3\n\n19.1 “17\n\nS&P 500 Total Return Index Bloomberg Barclays High\nYield Energy Total Return\n\nIndex\n\nS&P Banks Select Industry\nTotal Return Index\n\nData through December 31, 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Bloomberg.\n\npoint of the year. Energy high yield provides an\nexcellent example. On February 11, 2016, the\nUS energy high yield sector (as measured by the\nBloomberg Barclays High Yield Energy Total\nReturn Index) was down 19.1% year to date—one\nof the worst-performing sub-asset classes at that\ntime. Similarly, the US bank sector (as measured by\nthe S&P Banks Select Industry Total Return Index)\nwas down 21.7% over the same period. We had\nin place tactical tilts in both sectors. As oil prices\nrecovered, high yield energy securities rallied, with\nthe benchmark index ending the year up 37.4%—a\nwild swing of 56 percentage points from low to\nhigh. US banks also rallied initially in response\nto prospects of higher interest rates and later in\nanticipation of less regulation under a Trump\nadministration. The bank sector index rallied to\nend the year 31.3% higher than at the start—an\nequally wild swing of 53 percentage\npoints from low to high.\n\nWe have to be realistic: we cannot\nanticipate such market swings on\na consistent basis. Therefore, it is\nimperative that clients maintain a\nlong investment horizon, be tactical\nwhen investment opportunities present\nthemselves—usually at times of extreme\nstress in the financial markets—and\notherwise stay invested in the appropriate\nstrategic asset allocation.\n\nOur second observation was that\nour five-year annualized return forecasts\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 21\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014554",
