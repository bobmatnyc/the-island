Bannon also suggested that a racist \nelement in far-right parties \"all gets kind of washed out,\" that the West was facing a \n\"crisis of capitalism\" after losing its \"Judeo-Christian foundation,\" and he blasted \"crony \ncapitalists\" in Washington for failing to prosecute bank executives over the financial \ncrisis. \nThe remarks — beamed into a small conference room in a 15th-century marble palace in \na secluded corner of the Vatican — were part of a 50-minute Q&A during a conference \nfocused on poverty hosted by the Human Dignity Institute, which BuzzFeed News \nattended as part of its coverage of the rise of Europe's religious right. The group was \nfounded by Benjamin Harnwell, a longtime aide to Conservative member of the \nEuropean Parliament Nirj Deva to promote a \"Christian voice\" in European politics. The \ngroup has ties to some of the most conservative factions inside the Catholic \nChurch; Cardinal Raymond Burke, one of the most vocal critics of Pope Francis who \nwas ousted from a senior Vatican position in 2014, is chair of the group's advisory \nboard. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029063 \nBuzzFeed News originally posted a transcript beginning 90 seconds into the then-\nBreitbart News chairman's remarks because microphone placement made the opening \nmostly unintelligible, but we have completed the transcript from a video of the talk on \nYouTube. You can hear the whole recording at the bottom of the post. \nHere is what he said, unedited: \nSteve Bannon: Thank you very much Benjamin, and I appreciate you guys including us \nin this. We're speaking from Los Angeles today, right across the street from our \nheadquarters in Los Angeles. Um. I want to talk about wealth creation and what wealth \ncreation really can achieve and maybe take it in a slightly different direction, because I \nbelieve the world, and particularly the Judeo-Christian west, is in a crisis. And it's really \nthe organizing principle of how we built Breitbart News to really be a platform to bring \nnews and information to people throughout the world. Principally in the west, but we're \nexpanding internationally to let people understand the depths of this crisis, and it is a \ncrisis both of capitalism but really of the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian west in \nour beliefs. \nIt's ironic, I think, that we're talking today at exactly, tomorrow, roo years ago, at the \nexact moment we're talking, the assassination took place in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz \nFerdinand that led to the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the bloodiest \ncentury in mankind's history. Just to put it in perspective, with the assassination that \ntook place roo years ago tomorrow in Sarajevo, the world was at total peace. There was \ntrade, there was globalization, there was technological transfer, the High Church of \nEngland and the Catholic Church and the Christian faith was predominant throughout \nEurope of practicing Christians. Seven weeks later, I think there were 5 million men in \nuniform and within 30 days there were over a million casualties. \nThat war triggered a century of barbaric — unparalleled in mankind's history — virtually \n180 to 200 million people were killed in the 20th century, and I believe that, you know, \nhundreds of years from now when they look back, we're children of that: We're children \nof that barbarity. This will be looked at almost as a new Dark Age. \nBut the thing that got us out of it, the organizing principle that met this, was not just the \nheroism of our people — whether it was French resistance fighters, whether it was the \nPolish resistance fighters, or it's the young men from Kansas City or the Midwest who \nstormed the beaches of Normandy, commandos in England that fought with the Royal Air \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029064 \nForce, that fought this great war, really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right? \nThe underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave \nus the wherewithal. It kind of organized and built the materials needed to support, \nwhether it's the Soviet Union, England, the United States, and eventually to take back \ncontinental Europe and to beat back a barbaric empire in the Far East. \nThat capitalism really generated tremendous wealth. And that wealth was really \ndistributed among a middle class, a rising middle class, people who come from really \nworking-class environments and created what we really call a Pax Americana. It was \nmany, many years and decades of peace. And I believe we've come partly offtrack in the \nyears since the fall of the Soviet Union and we're starting now in the 21st century, which I \nbelieve, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, a crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a \ncrisis of capitalism. \n\"I believe we've come partly offtrack in the \nyears since the fall of the Soviet Union and \nwe're starting now in the 21st century, which I \nbelieve, strongly, is a crisis both of our church, \na crisis of our faith, a crisis of the West, a \ncrisis of capitalism.\" \nAnd we're at the very beginning stages of a very brutal and bloody conflict, of which if the \npeople in this room, the people in the church, do not bind together and really form what I \nfeel is an aspect of the church militant, to really be able to not just stand with our beliefs, \nbut to fight for our beliefs against this new barbarity that's starting, that will completely \neradicate everything that we've been bequeathed over the last 2,000, 2,500 years. \nNow, what I mean by that specifically: I think that you're seeing three kinds of converging \ntendencies: One is a form of capitalism that is taken away from the underlying spiritual \nand moral foundations of Christianity and, really, Judeo-Christian belief. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029065 \nI see that every day. I'm a very practical, pragmatic capitalist. I was trained at Goldman \nSachs, I went to Harvard Business School, I was as hard-nosed a capitalist as you get. I \nspecialized in media, in investing in media companies, and it's a very, very tough \nenvironment. And you've had a fairly good track record. So I don't want this to kinda \nsound namby-pamby, \"Let's all hold hands and sing `Kumbaya' around capitalism.\" \nBut there's a strand of capitalism today — two strands of it, that are very disturbing. \nOne is state-sponsored capitalism. And that's the capitalism you see in China and Russia. \nI believe it's what Holy Father [Pope Francis] has seen for most of his life in places like \nArgentina, where you have this kind of crony capitalism of people that are involved with \nthese military powers-that-be in the government, and it forms a brutal form of capitalism \nthat is really about creating wealth and creating value for a very small subset of people. \nAnd it doesn't spread the tremendous value creation throughout broader distribution \npatterns that were seen really in the 20th century. \nThe second form of capitalism that I feel is almost as disturbing, is what I call the Ayn \nRand or the Objectivist School of libertarian capitalism. And, look, I'm a big believer in a \nlot of libertarianism. I have many many friends that's a very big part of the conservative \nmovement — whether it's the UKIP movement in England, it's many of the underpinnings \nof the populist movement in Europe, and particularly in the United States. \nHowever, that form of capitalism is quite different when you really look at it to what I call \nthe \"enlightened capitalism\" of the Judeo-Christian West. It is a capitalism that really \nlooks to make people commodities, and to objectify people, and to use them almost — as \nmany of the precepts of Marx — and that is a form of capitalism, particularly to a younger \ngeneration [that] they're really finding quite attractive. And if they don't see another \nalternative, it's going to be an alternative that they gravitate to under this kind of rubric of \n“personal freedom.\" \n\"Look at what's happening in ISIS ... look at \nthe sophistication of which they've taken the \ntools of capitalism ... at what they've done \nwith Twitter and Facebook.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029066 \nThe other tendency is an immense secularization of the West. And I know we've talked \nabout secularization for a long time, but if you look at younger people, especially \nmillennials under 30, the overwhelming drive of popular culture is to absolutely \nsecularize this rising iteration. \nNow that call converges with something we have to face, and it's a very unpleasant topic, \nbut we are in an outright war against jihadist Islamic fascism. And this war is, I think, \nmetastasizing far quicker than governments can handle it. \nIf you look at what's happening in ISIS, which is the Islamic State of Syria and the Levant, \nthat is now currently forming the caliphate that is having a military drive on Baghdad, if \nyou look at the sophistication of which they've taken the tools of capitalism. If you look at \nwhat they've done with Twitter and Facebook and modern ways to fundraise, and to use \ncrowdsourcing to fund, besides all the access to weapons, over the last couple days they \nhave had a radical program of taking kids and trying to turn them into bombers. They \nhave driven 50,000 Christians out of a town near the Kurdish border. We have video that \nwe're putting up later today on Breitbart where they've took 50 hostages and thrown them \noff a cliff in Iraq. \nThat war is expanding and it's metastasizing to sub-Saharan Africa. We have Boko Haram \nand other groups that will eventually partner with ISIS in this global war, and it is, \nunfortunately, something that we're going to have to face, and we're going to have to face \nvery quickly. \nSo I think the discussion of, should we put a cap on wealth creation and distribution? It's \nsomething that should be at the heart of every Christian that is a capitalist — \"What is the \npurpose of whatever I'm doing with this wealth? What is the purpose of what I'm doing \nwith the ability that God has given us, that divine providence has given us to actually be a \ncreator of jobs and a creator of wealth?\" \nI think it really behooves all of us to really take a hard look and make sure that we are \nreinvesting that back into positive things. But also to make sure that we understand that \nwe're at the very beginning stages of a global conflict, and if we do not bind together as \npartners with others in other countries that this conflict is only going to metastasize. \nThey have a Twitter account up today, ISIS does, about turning the United States into a \n\"river of blood\" if it comes in and tries to defend the city of Baghdad. And trust me, that is \ngoing to come to Europe. That is going to come to Central Europe, it's going to come to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029067 \nWestern Europe, it's going to come to the United Kingdom. And so I think we are in a \ncrisis of the underpinnings of capitalism, and on top of that we're now, I believe, at the \nbeginning stages of a global war against Islamic fascism. \n\"With all the baggage that those [right-wing] \ngroups bring — and trust me, a lot of them \nbring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and \nracially— but we think that will all be worked \nthrough with time.\" \nBenjamin Harnwell, Human Dignity Institute: Thank you, Steve. That was a \nfascinating, fascinating overview. I am particularly struck by your argument, then, that in \nfact, capitalism would spread around the world based on the Judeo-Christian foundation \nis, in fact, something that can create peace through peoples rather than antagonism, \nwhich is often a point not sufficiently appreciated. Before I turn behind me to take a \nquestion — \nBannon: One thing I want to make sure of, if you look at the leaders of capitalism at that \ntime, when capitalism was I believe at its highest flower and spreading its benefits to most \nof mankind, almost all of those capitalists were strong believers in the Judeo-Christian \nWest. They were either active participants in the Jewish faith, they were active \nparticipants in the Christians' faith, and they took their beliefs, and the underpinnings of \ntheir beliefs was manifested in the work they did. And I think that's incredibly important \nand something that would really become unmoored. I can see this on Wall Street today — \nI can see this with the securitization of everything is that, everything is looked at as a \nsecuritization opportunity. People are looked at as commodities. I don't believe that our \nforefathers had that same belief. \nHarnwell: Over the course of this conference we've heard from various points of view \nregarding alleviation of poverty. We've heard from the center-left perspective, we've \nheard from the socialist perspective, we've heard from the Christian democrat, if you will, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029068 \nperspective. What particularly interests me about your point of view Steve, to talk \nspecifically about your work, Breitbart is very close to the tea party movement. So I'm just \nwondering whether you could tell me about if in the current flow of contemporary politics \n— first tell us a little bit about Breitbart, what the mission is, and then tell me about the \nreach that you have and then could you say a little bit about the current dynamic of what's \ngoing on at the moment in the States. \nBannon: Outside of Fox News and the Drudge Report, we're the third-largest \nconservative news site and, quite frankly, we have a bigger global reach than even Fox. \nAnd that's why we're expanding so much internationally. \nLook, we believe — strongly — that there is a global tea party movement. We've seen that. \nWe were the first group to get in and start reporting on things like UKIP and Front \nNational and other center right. With all the baggage that those groups bring — and trust \nme, a lot of them bring a lot of baggage, both ethnically and racially — but we think that \nwill all be worked through with time. \nThe central thing that binds that all together is a center-right populist movement of really \nthe middle class, the working men and women in the world who are just tired of being \ndictated to by what we call the party of Davos. A group of kind of — we're not conspiracy-\ntheory guys, but there's certainly — and I could see this when I worked at Goldman Sachs \n— there are people in New York that feel closer to people in London and in Berlin than \nthey do to people in Kansas and in Colorado, and they have more of this elite mentality \nthat they're going to dictate to everybody how the world's going to be run. \nI will tell you that the working men and women of Europe and Asia and the United States \nand Latin America don't believe that. They believe they know what's best for how they will \ncomport their lives. They think they know best about how to raise their families and how \nto educate their families. So I think you're seeing a global reaction to centralized \ngovernment, whether that government is in Beijing or that government is in Washington, \nDC, or that government is in Brussels. So we are the platform for the voice of that. \n\"Putin's ... very, very very intelligent. I can see this in the United States where he's \nplaying very strongly to social conservatives about his message about more traditional \nvalues, so I think it's something that we have to be very much on guard of.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029069 \nNow, with that, we are strong capitalists. And we believe in the benefits of capitalism. \nAnd, particularly, the harder-nosed the capitalism, the better. However, like I said, there's \ntwo strands of capitalism that we're quite concerned about. \nOne is crony capitalism, or what we call state-controlled capitalism, and that's the big \nthing the tea party is fighting in the United States, and really the tea party's biggest fight \nis not with the left, because we're not there yet. The biggest fight the tea party has today is \njust like UKIP. UKIP's biggest fight is with the Conservative Party. \nThe tea party in the United States' biggest fight is with the the Republican establishment, \nwhich is really a collection of crony capitalists that feel that they have a different set of \nrules of how they're going to comport themselves and how they're going to run things. \nAnd, quite frankly, it's the reason that the United States' financial situation is so dire, \nparticularly our balance sheet. We have virtually a hundred trillion dollars of unfunded \nliabilities. That is all because you've had this kind of crony capitalism in Washington, DC. \nThe rise of Breitbart is directly tied to being the voice of that center-right opposition. And, \nquite frankly, we're winning many, many victories. \nOn the social conservative side, we're the voice of the anti-abortion movement, the voice \nof the traditional marriage movement, and I can tell you we're winning victory after \nvictory after victory. Things are turning around as people have a voice and have a \nplatform of which they can use. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029070 \nKirk Irwin / Getty Images \nHarnwell: The third-largest conservative news website is something to be extremely \nimpressed by. Can you tell for the people here who aren't within the Anglosphere and they \nmight not follow American domestic politics at the moment — there seems to be a \nsubstantial sea change going on at the moment in Middle America. And the leader of the \nmajority party, Eric Cantor, was deselected a couple of weeks ago by a tea party \ncandidate. What does that mean for the state of domestic politics in America at the \nmoment? \nBannon: For everybody in your audience, this is one of the most monumental — first off, \nit's the biggest election upset in the history of the American republic. Eric Cantor was the \nHouse majority leader and raised $10 million. He spent, between himself and outside \ngroups, $8 million to hold a congressional district. He ran against a professor who was an \nevangelical Christian and a libertarian economist. He ran against a professor who raised \nin total $175,000. In fact, the bills from Eric Cantor's campaign at a elite steak house in \nWashington, DC, was over $200,000. So they spent more than $200,000 over the course \nof the campaign wining and dining fat cats at a steak house in Washington than the entire \nopposition had to run. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029071 \nNow, Eric Cantor, it was a He lost 57-43, and not one — outside of Breitbart, we \ncovered this for six months, day in and day out — not one news site — not Fox News, not \nPolitico, no sites picked this up. And the reason that this guy won is quite simple: Middle-\nclass people and working-class people are tired of people like Eric Cantor who say they're \nconservative selling out their interests every day to crony capitalists. \n\"That center-right revolt is really a global \nrevolt. I think you're going to see it in Latin \nAmerica, I think you're going to see it in Asia, \nI think you've already seen it in India.\" \nAnd you're seeing that whether that was UKIP and Nigel Farage in the United Kingdom, \nwhether it's these groups in the Low Countries in Europe, whether it's in France, there's a \nnew tea party in Germany. The theme is all the same. And the theme is middle-class and \nworking-class people — they're saying, \"Hey, I'm working harder than I've ever worked. \nI'm getting less benefits than I'm ever getting through this, I'm incurring less wealth \nmyself, and I'm seeing a system of fat cats who say they're conservative and say they back \ncapitalist principles, but all they're doing is binding with corporatists.\" Right? \nCorporatists, to garner all the benefits for themselves. \nAnd that center-right revolt is really a global revolt. I think you're going to see it in Latin \nAmerica, I think you're going to see it in Asia, I think you've already seen it in India. \nModi's great victory was very much based on these Reaganesque principles, so I think this \nis a global revolt, and we are very fortunate and proud to be the news site that is reporting \nthat throughout the world. \nHarnwell: I think it's important to understand the distinction that you're drawing here \nbetween what can be understood as authentic, free-market capitalism as a means of \npromoting wealth that [unintelligible] involves everybody with a form of crony capitalism \nwhich simply benefits a certain class. And we've watched over the course of our \nconference, we've watched two video segments produced by the Acton Institute about \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029072 \nhow development aid is spent internationally and how that can be driven away from — it \ndamages people on the ground but it also perpetuates a governing class. And the point \nthat you're mentioning here, that I think that you're saying has driven almost a revolution \nmovement in America, is the same phenomenon of what's going on in the developing \nworld, which is a concept of government which is no longer doing what it is morally \nbound to do but has become corrupt and self-serving. So it's effectively the sa—\nBannon: It's exactly the same. Currently, if you read The Economist, you read \nthe Financial Times this week, you'll see there's a relatively obscure agency in the federal \ngovernment that is engaged in a huge fight that may lead to a government shutdown. It's \ncalled the Export-Import Bank. And for years, it was a bank that helped finance things \nthat other banks wouldn't do. And what's happening over time is that it's metastasized to \nbe a cheap form of financing to General Electric and to Boeing and to other large \ncorporations. You get this financing from other places if they wanted to, but they're \nputting this onto the middle-class taxpayers to support this. \n\"I'm not an expert in this, but it seems that [right-wing parties] have had some aspects \nthat may be anti-Semitic or racial ... My point is that over time it all gets kind of washed \nout, right?\" \nAnd the tea party is using this as an example of the cronyism. General Electric and these \nmajor corporations that are in bed with the federal government are not what we'd \nconsider free-enterprise capitalists. We're backers of entrepreneurial capitalists. They're \nnot. They're what we call corporatist. They want to have more and more monopolistic \npower and they're doing that kind of convergence with big government. And so the fight \nhere — and that's why the media's been very late to this party — but the fight you're \nseeing is between entrepreneur capitalism, and the Acton Institute is a tremendous \nsupporter of, and the people like the corporatists that are closer to the people like we \nthink in Beijing and Moscow than they are to the entrepreneurial capitalist spirit of the \nUnited States. \nHarnwell: Thanks, Steve. I'm going to turn around now, as I'm sure we have some great \nquestions from the floor. Who has the first question then? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029073 \nBannon: First of all, Benjamin, I can tell you I could hardly recognize you, you're so \ncleaned up you are for the conference. \n[Laughter] \nQuestioner: Hello, my name is Deborah Lubov. I'm a Vatican correspondent for Zenit \nnews agency, for their English edition. I have some experience working in New York — I \nwas working for PricewaterhouseCoopers auditing investment banks, one of which was \nGoldman Sachs. And considering this conference is on poverty, I'm curious — from your \npoint of view especially, your experience in the investment banking world — what \nconcrete measures do you think they should be doing to combat, prevent this \nphenomenon? We know that various sums of money are used in all sorts of ways and they \ndo have different initiatives, but in order to concretely counter this epidemic now, what \nare your thoughts? \n\"For Christians, and particularly for those who believe in the underpinnings of the \nJudeo-Christian West, I don't believe that we should have a [financial] bailout.\" \nBannon: That's a great question. The 2008 crisis, I think the financial crisis — which, by \nthe way, I don't think we've come through — is really driven I believe by the greed, much \nof it driven by the greed of the investment banks. My old firm, Goldman Sachs — \ntraditionally the best banks are leveraged 8:1. When we had the financial crisis in 2008, \nthe investment banks were leveraged 35:1. Those rules had specifically been changed by a \nguy named Hank Paulson. He was secretary of Treasury. As chairman of Goldman Sachs, \nhe had gone to Washington years before and asked for those changes. That made the \nbanks not really investment banks, but made them hedge funds — and highly susceptible \nto changes in liquidity. And so the crisis of 2008 was, quite frankly, really never recovered \nfrom in the United States. It's one of the reasons last quarter you saw 2.9% negative \ngrowth in a quarter. So the United States economy is in very, very tough shape. \nAnd one of the reasons is that we've never really gone and dug down and sorted through \nthe problems of 2008. Particularly the fact — think about it — not one criminal charge has \never been brought to any bank executive associated with 2008 crisis. And in fact, it gets \nworse. No bonuses and none of their equity was taken. So part of the prime drivers of the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029074 \nwealth that they took in the 15 years leading up to the crisis was not hit at all, and I think \nthat's one of the fuels of this populist revolt that we're seeing as the tea party. So I think \nthere are many, many measures, particularly about getting the banks on better footing, \nmaking them address all the liquid assets they have. I think you need a real clean-up of \nthe banks balance sheets. \nIn addition, I think you really need to go back and make banks do what they do: \nCommercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get \naway from this trading — you know, the hedge fund securitization, which they've all \nbecome basically trading operations and securitizations and not put capital back and \nreally grow businesses and to grow the economy. So I think it's a whole area that just — \nand I will tell you, the underpinning of this populist revolt is the financial crisis of 2008. \nThat revolt, the way that it was dealt with, the way that the people who ran the banks and \nran the hedge funds have never really been held accountable for what they did, has fueled \nmuch of the anger in the tea party movement in the United States. \nQuestioner: Thank you. \nBannon: Great question. \nQuestioner: Hello, Mr. Bannon. I'm Mario Fantini, a Vermonter living in Vienna, \nAustria. You began describing some of the trends you're seeing worldwide, very \ndangerous trends, worry trends. Another movement that I've been seeing grow and \nspread in Europe, unfortunately, is what can only be described as tribalist or neo-nativist \nmovement — they call themselves Identitarians. These are mostly young, working-class, \npopulist groups, and they're teaching self-defense classes, but also they are arguing \nagainst — and quite effectively, I might add — against capitalism and global financial \ninstitutions, etc. How do we counteract this stuff? Because they're appealing to a lot of \nyoung people at a very visceral level, especially with the ethnic and racial stuff. \nBannon: I didn't hear the whole question, about the tribalist? \n\"One of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department, 35 [bank] executives, \nI believe, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever \nbeen followed up on.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029075 \nQuestioner: Very simply put, there's a growing movement among young people here in \nEurope, in France and in Austria and elsewhere, and they're arguing very effectively \nagainst Wall Street institutions and they're also appealing to people on an ethnic and \nracial level. And I was just wondering what you would recommend to counteract these \nmovements, which are growing. \nBannon: One of the reasons that you can understand how they're being fueled is that \nthey're not seeing the benefits of capitalism. I mean particularly — and I think it's \nparticularly more advanced in Europe than it is in the United States, but in the United \nStates it's getting pretty advanced — is that when you have this kind of crony capitalism, \nyou have a different set of rules for the people that make the rules. It's this partnership of \nbig government and corporatists. I think it starts to fuel, particularly as you start to see \nnegative job creation. If you go back, in fact, and look at the United States' GDP, you look \nat a bunch of Europe. If you take out government spending, you know, we've had negative \ngrowth on a real basis for over a decade. \nAnd that all trickles down to the man in the street. If you look at people's lives, and \nparticularly millennials, look at people under 30 — people under 30, there's 50% really \nunder employment of people in the United States, which is probably the most advanced \neconomy in the West, and it gets worse in Europe. \nI think in Spain it's something like 50 or 6o% of the youth under 30 are underemployed. \nAnd that means the decade of their twenties, which is where you have to learn a skill, \nwhere you have to learn a craft, where you really start to get comfortable in your \nprofession, you're taking that away from the entire generation. That's only going to fuel \ntribalism, that's only going to fuel [unintelligible]... That's why to me, it's incumbent upon \nfreedom-loving people to make sure that we sort out these governments and make sure \nthat we sort out particularly this crony capitalism so that the benefits become more of this \nentrepreneurial spirit and that can flow back to working-class and middle-class people. \nBecause if not, we're going to pay a huge price for this. You can already start to see it. \nQuestioner: I have a question, because you worked on Wall Street. What is the opinion \nthere on whether they think bank bailouts are justified? Is there a Christian-centered \n[unintelligible] that they think should be bailed out? The crisis starts earlier than 2008. \nWhat was the precedent then? What was the feeling on Wall Street when they bailed out \nthe banks? How should Christians feel about advocating or being against that? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029076 \nBannon: I think one is about responsibility. For Christians, and particularly for those \nwho believe in the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian West, I don't believe that we \nshould have a bailout. I think the bailouts in 2008 were wrong. And I think, you look in \nhindsight, it was a lot of misinformation that was presented about the bailouts of the \nbanks in the West. \nAnd look at the [unintelligible] it. Middle-class taxpayers, people that are working-class \npeople, right, people making incomes under $50,000 and $6o,000, it was the burden of \nthose taxpayers, right, that bailed out the elites. And let's think about it for a second. \nHere's how capitalism metastasized, is that all the burdens put on the working-class \npeople who get none of the upside. All of the upside goes to the crony capitalists. \nThe bailouts were absolutely outrageous, and here's why: It bailed out a group of \nshareholders and executives who were specifically accountable. The shareholders were \naccountable for one simple reason: They allowed this to go wrong without changing \nmanagement. And the management team of this. And we know this now from \ncongressional investigations, we know it from independent investigations, this is not \nsome secret conspiracy. This is kind of in plain sight. \nIn fact, one of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department 35 executives, I \nbelieve, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever \nbeen followed up on. Because even with the Democrats, right, in power, there's a sense \nbetween the law firms, and the accounting firms, and the investment banks, and their \nstooges on Capitol Hill, they looked the other way. \nSo you can understand why middle class people having a tough go of it making $5o or \n$60 thousand a year and see their taxes go up, and they see that their taxes are going to \npay for government sponsored bailouts, what you've created is really a free option. You \nsay to this investment banking, create a free option for bad behavior. In otherwise all the \nupside goes to the hedge funds and the investment bank, and to the crony capitalist with \nstock increases and bonus increases. And their downside is limited, because middle class \npeople are going to come and bail them out with tax dollars. \nAnd that's what I think is fueling this populist revolt. Whether that revolt is in the \nmidlands of England, or whether it's in Middle America. And I think people are fed up \nwith it. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029077 \nAnd I think that's why you're seeing — when you read the media says, \"tea party is losing, \nlosing elections,\" that is all BS. The elections we don't win, we're forcing those crony \ncapitalists to come and admit that they're not going to do this again. The whole narrative \nin Washington has been changed by this populist revolt that we call the grassroots of the \ntea party movement. \nAnd it's specifically because those bailouts were completely and totally unfair. It didn't \nmake those financial institutions any stronger, and it bailed out a bunch of people — by \nthe way, and these are people that have all gone to Yale, and Harvard, they went to the \nfinest institutions in the West. They should have known better. \nAnd by the way: It's all the institutions of the accounting firms, the law firms, the \ninvestment banks, the consulting firms, the elite of the elite, the educated elite, they \nunderstood what they were getting into, forcibly took all the benefits from it and then \nlook to the government, went hat in hand to the government to be bailed out. And they've \nnever been held accountable today. Trust me — they are going to be held accountable. \nYou're seeing this populist movement called the tea party in the United States. \nHarnwell: Okay, I think we've got time for just one or two more questions for Stephen \nK. Bannon, chairman of Breitbart Media, third-largest news organization in the States. I \nknow you're a very, very busy man, so we're very grateful for the time that you've agreed \nto put aside for this, to close this conference. \n\"I certainly think secularism has sapped the \nstrength of the Judeo-Christian West to defend \nits ideals, right?\" \nBannon: I'm never too busy to share with a group that can do as much good as you guys \ncan. \nQuestioner: What do you think is the major threat today, to the Judeo-Christian \nCivilization? Secularism, or the Muslim world? In my humble opinion, they're just trying \nto defend themselves from our cultural invasion. Thank you. \n[Question restated by Harnwell] \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029078 \nBannon: It's a great question. I certainly think secularism has sapped the strength of the \nJudeo-Christian West to defend its ideals, right? \nIf you go back to your home countries and your proponent of the defense of the Judeo-\nChristian West and its tenets, often times, particularly when you deal with the elites, \nyou're looked at as someone who is quite odd. So it has kind of sapped the strength. \nBut I strongly believe that whatever the causes of the current drive to the caliphate was — \nand we can debate them, and people can try to deconstruct them — we have to face a very \nunpleasant fact: And that unpleasant fact is that there is a major war brewing, a war that's \nalready global. It's going global in scale, and today's technology, today's media, today's \naccess to weapons of mass destruction, it's going to lead to a global conflict that I believe \nhas to be confronted today. Every day that we refuse to look at this as what it is, and the \nscale of it, and really the viciousness of it, will be a day where you will rue that we didn't \nact [unintelligible]. \n\"The way that the people who ran the banks \nand ran the hedge funds have never really been \nheld accountable for what they did has fueled \nmuch of the anger in the tea party movement in \nthe United States.\" \nQuestioner: Thank you very much. I'm [unintelligible]. I come from Slovakia. This is \nactually the source of my two very quick questions. Thank you very much for the work \nthat you do to promote the Judeo-Christian values in the world. I really appreciate it, and \nI also feel that the danger is very high. I have two minor questions, because you have \nmentioned, in terms of UKIP and Front National [unintelligible]. From the European \nperspective, listening to the language which has become more and more radical from \nthese two parties, especially before the European Parliament elections, I'm just \nwondering what are your plans on how to help these partners from Europe to maybe \nfocus on the value issues and not with populist? And also it goes in terms — you have \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029079 \nmentioned the involvement of state in capitalism as one of the big dangers. But these two \nparties you've mentioned, they actually have close ties with Putin, who is the promoter of \nthis big danger, so I'd like to know your thoughts about this and how you're going to deal \nwith it. \nBannon: Could you summarize that for me? \nHarnwell: The first question was, you'd reference the Front National and UKIP as \nhaving elements that are tinged with the racial aspect amidst their voter profile, and the \nquestioner was asking how you intend to deal with that aspect. \nBannon: I don't believe I said UKIP in that. I was really talking about the parties on the \ncontinent, Front National and other European parties. \nI'm not an expert in this, but it seems that they have had some aspects that may be anti-\nSemitic or racial. By the way, even in the tea party, we have a broad movement like this, \nand we've been criticized, and they try to make the tea party as being racist, etc., which \nit's not. But there's always elements who turn up at these things, whether it's militia guys \nor whatever. Some that are fringe organizations. My point is that over time it all gets kind \nof washed out, right? People understand what pulls them together, and the people on the \nmargins I think get marginalized more and more. \nI believe that you'll see this in the center-right populist movement in continental Europe. \nI've spent quite a bit of time with UKIP, and I can say to you that I've never seen anything \nat all with UKIP that even comes close to that. I think they've done a very good job of \npolicing themselves to really make sure that people including the British National Front \nand others were not included in the party, and I think you've seen that also with tea party \ngroups, where some people would show up and were kind of marginal members of the tea \nparty, and the tea party did a great job of policing themselves early on. And I think that's \nwhy when you hear charges of racism against the tea party, it doesn't stick with the \nAmerican people, because they really understand. \nI think when you look at any kind of revolution — and this is a revolution — you always \nhave some groups that are disparate. I think that will all burn away over time and you'll \nsee more of a mainstream center-right populist movement. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029080 \n\"Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin and his cronies are really a \nkleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to expand.\" \nQuestion: Obviously, before the European elections the two parties had a clear link to \nPutin. If one of the representatives of the dangers of capitalism is the state involvement in \ncapitalism, so, I see there, also Marine Le Pen campaigning in Moscow with Putin, and \nalso UKIP strongly defending Russian positions in geopolitical terms. \n[Harnwell restates, but unintelligible] \nHarnwell: These two parties have both been cultivating President Putin [unintelligible]. \nBannon: I think it's a little bit more complicated. When Vladimir Putin, when you really \nlook at some of the underpinnings of some of his beliefs today, a lot of those come from \nwhat I call Eurasianism; he's got an adviser who harkens back to Julius Evola and \ndifferent writers of the early 20th century who are really the supporters of what's called \nthe traditionalist movement, which really eventually metastasized into Italian fascism. A \nlot of people that are traditionalists are attracted to that. \nOne of the reasons is that they believe that at least Putin is standing up for traditional \ninstitutions, and he's trying to do it in a form of nationalism — and I think that people, \nparticularly in certain countries, want to see the sovereignty for their country, they want \nto see nationalism for their country. They don't believe in this kind of pan-European \nUnion or they don't believe in the centralized government in the United States. They'd \nrather see more of a states-based entity that the founders originally set up where \nfreedoms were controlled at the local level. \n\"You're seeing a global reaction to centralized \ngovernment, whether that government is in \nBeijing or that government is in Washington, \nDC, or that government is in Brussels. So we \nare the platform for the voice of that.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029081 \nI'm not justifying Vladimir Putin and the kleptocracy that he represents, because he \neventually is the state capitalist of kleptocracy. However, we the Judeo-Christian West \nreally have to look at what he's talking about as far as traditionalism goes — particularly \nthe sense of where it supports the underpinnings of nationalism — and I happen to think \nthat the individual sovereignty of a country is a good thing and a strong thing. I think \nstrong countries and strong nationalist movements in countries make strong neighbors, \nand that is really the building blocks that built Western Europe and the United States, \nand I think it's what can see us forward. \nYou know, Putin's been quite an interesting character. He's also very, very, very \nintelligent. I can see this in the United States where he's playing very strongly to social \nconservatives about his message about more traditional values, so I think it's something \nthat we have to be very much on guard of. Because at the end of the day, I think that Putin \nand his cronies are really a kleptocracy, that are really an imperialist power that want to \nexpand. However, I really believe that in this current environment, where you're facing a \npotential new caliphate that is very aggressive that is really a situation — I'm not saying \nwe can put it on a back burner — but I think we have to deal with first things first. \nQuestioner: One of my questions has to do with how the West should be responding to \nradical Islam. How, specifically, should we as the West respond to Jihadism without \nlosing our own soul? Because we can win the war and lose ourselves at the same time. \nHow should the West respond to radical Islam and not lose itself in the process? \nBannon: From a perspective — this may be a little more militant than others. I think \ndefinitely you're going to need an aspect that is [unintelligible]. I believe you should take \na very, very, very aggressive stance against radical Islam. And I realize there are other \naspects that are not as militant and not as aggressive and that's fine. \nIf you look back at the long history of the Judeo-Christian West struggle against Islam, I \nbelieve that our forefathers kept their stance, and I think they did the right thing. I think \nthey kept it out of the world, whether it was at Vienna, or Tours, or other places... It \nbequeathed to use the great institution that is the church of the West. \nAnd I would ask everybody in the audience today, because you really are the movers and \ndrivers and shakers and thought leaders in the Catholic Church today, is to think, when \npeople 500 years from now are going to think about today, think about the actions you've \ntaken — and I believe everyone associated with the church and associated with the Judeo-\nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029082 \nChristian West that believes in the underpinnings of that and believes in the precepts of \nthat and want to see that bequeathed to other generations down the road as it was \nbequeathed to us, particularly as you're in a city like Rome, and in a place like the Vatican, \nsee what's been bequeathed to us — ask yourself, 500 years from today, what are they \ngoing to say about me? What are they going to say about what I did at the beginning \nstages of this crisis? \nBecause it is a crisis, and it's not going away. You don't have to take my word for it. All \nyou have to do is read the news every day, see what's coming up, see what they're putting \non Twitter, what they're putting on Facebook, see what's on CNN, what's on BBC. See \nwhat's happening, and you will see we're in a war of immense proportions. It's very easy \nto play to our baser instincts, and we can't do that. But our forefathers didn't do it either. \nAnd they were able to stave this off, and they were able to defeat it, and they were able to \nbequeath to us a church and a civilization that really is the flower of mankind, so I think \nit's incumbent on all of us to do what I call a gut check, to really think about what our role \nis in this battle that's before us. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
