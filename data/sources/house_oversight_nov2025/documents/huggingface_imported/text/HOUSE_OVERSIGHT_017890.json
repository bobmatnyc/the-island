  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n825\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\navailable to the world community. Addi-\ntionally, Plaintiffs submit that these cases\nhave been widely reported in the Arabic\nmedia and the complaints have been avail-\nable on numerous websites for over two\nyears. In light of these considerations and\nJudge Robertson’s March 23, 2003 order\napproving service by publication for De-\nfendants including Mr. Batterjee, the\nCourt denies Mr. Batterjee’s motion to\nquash service.\n\n[70] The Court finds the Burnett\nPlaintiffs made a prima facie showing of\npersonal jurisdiction over Mr. Batterjee.\nWhile perhaps not dispositive on its own,\nMr. Batterjee’s designation as a terrorist\nlends substantial weight to Plaintiffs’\nclaims that he purposefully directed his\nactivities at the United States and that the\nexercise of personal jurisdiction over him\ncomports with due process. See Biton,\n310 F.Supp.2d at 178. Mr. Batterjee pur-\nportedly commissioned a book about al\nQaeda and Osama bin Laden. He is the\nchairman of Al Shamal Islamic Bank, a\nbank with admitted and substantial ties to\nOsama bin Laden. Burnett Complaint\n1170, 79. Additionally, he is involved in\nthe United States operations of designated\nterrorist, BIF. In the ten years leading up\nto the commencement of this action, Mr.\nBatterjee has had contacts with the United\nStates that could be related to the terror-\nist attacks inasmuch as BIF participated in\nthose attacks. Specifically, Mr. Batterjee\ntraveled to Chicago for BIF and had an\naddress in Florida for BIF. Accordingly,\nMr. Batterjee’s motion to dismiss the Bur-\nnett complaint for lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion is denied.\n\nIIT.\n\nIn considering Defendants’ motions to\ndismiss for failure to state a claim under\nRule 12(b)(6), the Court must “accept all of\nPlaintiffs’ factual allegations in the com-\n\nFailure to State a Claim\n\nplaint as true and draw inferences from\nthose allegations in the light most favor-\nable to the Plaintiffs.” Desiderio v. Natl\nAss’n of Sec. Dealers, Inc., 191 F.3d 198,\n202 (2d Cir.1999). Dismissal is not appro-\npriate unless it appears beyond doubt,\n“even when the complaint is liberally con-\nstrued, that the plaintiff can prove no set\nof facts which would entitle him to relief.”\nId.; Conley v. Gibson, 355 U.S. 41, 45-46,\n78 S.Ct. 99, 2 L.Ed.2d 80 (1957). Federal\nRule of Civil Procedure 8(a) requires that\na complaint contain “a short and plain\nstatement of the claim showing that the\npleader is entitled to relief.” Fed.R.Civ.P.\n8(a)(2). The Supreme Court reinforced\nthese liberal pleading standards in Swier-\nkiewicz v. Sorema N.A., 534 U.S. 506, 512,\n122 S.Ct. 992, 152 L.Ed.2d 1 (2002) (ob-\nserving the “short and plain statement”\nrequired by Rule 8 “must simply ‘give the\ndefendant fair notice of what the plaintiff's\nclaim is and the grounds upon which it\nrests’ ”) (quoting Conley, 355 U.S. at 47, 78\n8.Ct. 99). When presented with a 12(b)(6)\nmotion, the district court may not consider\nmatters outside of the pleadings without\nconverting the motion into a motion for\nsummary judgment. Courtenay Commu-\nnications Corp. v. Hall, 334 F.3d 210, 213\n(2d Cir.2003); Friedl v. City of New York,\n210 F.3d 79, 83-84 (2d Cir.2000).\n\nA. Elements of Claims\n\n[71] Plaintiffs claim that each Defen-\ndant provided material support to the al\nQaeda terrorists who perpetrated the at-\ntacks on September 11, 2001. Under the\nATA, material support includes money, fi-\nnancial services, lodging, training, safe-\nhouses, and false documentation or identi-\nfication. 18 U.S.C. §§ 2339A(b), 2339B(¢).\nAssuming such support is alleged, Plain-\ntiffs will have to present a sufficient causal\nconnection between that support and the\ninjuries suffered by Plaintiffs.
