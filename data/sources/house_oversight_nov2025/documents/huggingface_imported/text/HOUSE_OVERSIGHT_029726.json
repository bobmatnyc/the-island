  "text": "with an immediate rolling and flowing\nstart. The United States will have to work\nfrom smaller troop footprints and be\nprepared to start fighting even as follow-\non-forces are on the way. Ideally, these\nforces would flow from multiple staging\npositions to reduce vulnerability to\nnuclear attack. The politics of the region,\nhowever, will work against securing a\nmultitude of staging areas from which to\ndeploy.\n\nThe region under the purview of\nCentcom has always been riddled with\npolitical violence that has posed\nformidable challenges to military\noperations. But in plotting a course over\nthe horizon, the political and military\nobstacles for American military surges\ninto the region are poised to grow even\nlarger. As a result, theater contingency\nplanners will have fewer good options for\nprojecting American military power into\nthe region -- and they'll have to do more\nwith the bad and the ugly.\n\nRichard L. Russell is Professor of\nNational Security Affairs at the Near East\nand South Asia Center for Strategic\nStudies.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029726",
