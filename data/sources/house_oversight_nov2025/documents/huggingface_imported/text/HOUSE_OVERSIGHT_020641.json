While independent reporting\ncontinues, Chinese official media have become more influential in the United Kingdom\nand internationally through their UK presence. Primarily, they have expanded their\noperations and reach. For example, the re-branded China Global Television Network\nEurope Ltd (CGTN), headquartered in London, is seeking to increase activities and\nChina Daily now distributes its China Watch “supplement” as an advertisement inside\nthe respected conservative newspaper the Daily Telegraph. The UK and Chinese\ngovernments have also concluded a Television Co-Production Agreement that provides\na framework under which TV producers in both countries can share resources but have\nto respect “stipulations in the relevant Party’s law and regulations.”\n\nGiven the United Kingdom's special historical relationship with Hong Kong, the\ncentral authorities’ heavy influence on the Hong Kong media and the deterioration of\nmedia freedom in Hong Kong are of relevance in the United Kingdom, where the case\nof rising self-censorship at the South China Morning Post, for example, has been noted.”\nAccording to confidential reports, some journalists who have left Hong Kong for the\nUnited Kingdom have encountered intimidation attempts.\n\nThe effects of media-influencing activities taking place in the United Kingdom are\nhard to assess. Critical reporting continues, but the rise of commercial ventures\ntransporting censorship into the United Kingdom looks set to continue too. For the\nmoment, increasingly difficult access to information and insight in China, as a result\nof domestic repression, is at least as great a problem as attempts to influence or repress\nremotely in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe Economy\n\nFor years, the United Kingdom was a bit of an outlier in its openness to Chinese\ninvestment and its willingness to grant Chinese firms, even state-owned ones, access to\nits critical infrastructure. Nonetheless, there is now growing concern in London about\nChina’s ability to leverage its growing economic power into political influence and to\nuse its riches to buy, borrow, or steal key Western technologies that sit at the heart of\nWestern economies.\n\nIn partnership with France and Germany, the UK government has also introduced\nmechanisms to monitor and block Chinese takeovers of high-technology companies in\nsensitive sectors.'® The three nations also support efforts to tighten EU-wide regulations\nto govern Chinese investment so that Chinese entities cannot exploit the weaker\nregulatory systems of some European countries to gain access to potentially sensitive\n\nAppendix 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020641",
