How cornharvest not already used for ethanol were repurposed for more ethanol?\n\nlarge an undertaking is it to bury 15% of all CO2 emissions? 160,000,000 US corn harvest, tonnes, 2010, not already used for ethanol\n33.2 billion tonnes of CO2 emissions (2010) 159,667,200,000 US corn harvest, kg, not already used for ethanol\n5.0 Sequestration target, billions of tonnes 0.40 Conversion ratio, liters of ethanol per kg\nNow fet’s shrink the CO 2 by compressing it before burying it... 63,866,880,000 Liters of converted ethanol\n0.80 Compressed gas density, tonnes per cubic meter 67% Energy density of ethanol relative to gasoline\n6.2 Volume of compressed CO, to bury, billions of cubic meters 42,699,571,200 Effective gasoline-equivalent savings (liters)\nf- 3.9 Amount of global crude oil extraction, billions of tonnes (2010) 521,845,394,389 Liters of total US gasoline consumption in 2010\n0.85 Density of crude oil, tonnes per cubic meter 8% Reduction in gasoline needs by repurposing entire corn harvest\n\n4.6 Volume of global crude oil extracted, bn cubic meters (2010) . . . .\nImplication: Benefits of corn ethanol appear to be close to their maximum\n\nImplication: Capturing a small portion of CO. emissions requires a production level. There is of course the issue of ethanol's \"energy return on\ncompression/transportation/storage industry whose throughput is greater investment” (EROI), forwhich estimates range from 0.8:1 to 1.6:1. Charles Hall\nthan the one used for oil extraction; and without the benefit that oil provides at SUNY ESF (originator of the EROI concept in the 1970's) published recent\nas an energy input. Coal-fired plant capital costs could rise 40%-75% (as EROls for oil (10-20); Tar sands and Shale Oil (3-5); Nuclear (5-15) and Wind\nper IPCC), and their electricity consumption could rise by 30%-40% for CCS (15-20, but that excludes the cost of back-up peaking plants). In that context,\nparticulate removal and flue gas desulfurization. Unlikely in time to prevent the EROI for corn ethanol, which excludes the various layers of subsidies\n\na further rise in COz emissions; unexplored legal and NIMBY issues as well. involved, is well below the fully loaded economic benefits of other fuel sources.\n\nQuestion #5: What about cellulosic ethanol? And what about using spent Question #6: How much area would be needed for a quarter of US\ncoffee grounds? electricity generation to come from wind?\n\n225,000,000 Tonnes of US corn stover, annual 2.3% Wind as a % of electricity generation\n224,532,000,000 kg of US corn stover (using conversion factors from #4) 10 Growth factor\n40% Amount that can be removed without destroying soil 23% Target wind generation\n89,812,800,000 Stover removed 95,000,000 Existing wind generation, MWh, 2010\n30% Efficiency losses (evaporation, transportation, etc) 950,000,000 Target MWh\n62,868,960,000 Remaining dry stover of uniform condition for conversion 28% Wind capacity factor\n0.34 Theoretical conversion ratio, liters of ethanol per kg of stover 387,312 Required incremental MW of wind\n21,375,446,400 Liters of ethanol produced from stover 2 watts per meter squared required for wind farms\n14,291,012,736 Gasoline-equivalent ethanol from stover (see #4) 193,656 square km of required area\n2.74% Percent of gasoline needs reduced from conversion of stover And on the need for expensive HVDC transmission lines...\nAnd another fun fact..... 30,099,000 US population living in prime wind and/or solar states\n0.16% Percent of global diesel fuel production offset by somehow [AZ, OK, NE, WY, CO, ND, SD, KS, IA, MT, NM + Northern TX]\ngathering all of the world's spent coffee grounds and then 309,350,000 US population\n\nsensetting them inte biodiess! Implication: 194 thousand square km is about the entire area of Nebraska. It\n\nImplication: Apart from Brazilian sugarcane, which grows 365 days a year would be a massive undertaking which requires, as stated earlier, hundreds of\nand needs no irrigation or fertilizer (it self-fertilizes), biofuels are challenged billions of dollars for new transmission lines. To be clear, land under wind\n\ndue to the cost of aggregation, low energy densities and high energy turbines still have many practical economic uses. The larger issues are\nextraction costs. F imitati te3. transmission and intermittency, as described below.\n\nAs for wind, let’s put aside concerns about space requirements and transmission lines. Let’s also put aside problems of wind’s\nreliance on rare earths like neodymium for its turbine magnets (neodymium prices quadrupled this year, and that’s with wind\nstill making up /ess than 3% of global electricity generation). Let’s also put aside debris (from birds/insects), ice storms and\nother natural elements that reduce wind farm efficiency. The reason to put them aside: if wind were more reliable, like\nhydropower, it could justify a lot more expense and effort. Unfortunately, wind is not that reliable. The first chart is the\n“Mona Lisa” of wind unreliability, measured at one of California’s largest wind farms. The second is from the California\nIndependent System Operator, showing how wind power tends to be low when power demand is high (and vice-versa).\n\nDay-to-day variability in wind generation in April 2005 California energy demand vs. total wind - summer 2006\n\nMegawatts Megawatts Megawatts\n700 > Each dayis a different color 38.000 California energy\n600 - __ Day 29 “fe demand (LHS) - 1,000\nx Dayo / ~~ 34,000 800\n500 - \\ Se.
