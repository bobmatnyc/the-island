Three weeks after the Crypto party, Snowden began anonymously\ncontacting a high-profile journalist, He used the same alias “Cincinnatus” that he used with\nSandvik, and to advertise the Oahu Crypto Party. The journalist to whom he wrote On December\n1, 2012, was Glenn Greenwald, the previously-mentioned Rio-based columnist for the Guardian.\n\nGreenwald had not always been an activist journalist. Up until 2004, Greenwald was a\nlitigation lawyer at the elite New York firm of Wachtell, Lipton, and Rosen & Katz. He was also\nan entrepreneur owning part of Master Notions, a company which, among other things, had a fifty\npercent financial interest in the pornographic website HJ (an acronym which originally stood for\n“Hairy Jock.”) All did not go well with this enterprise. In 2004, Greenwald became involved in\nan acrimonious law suit with his other associates in HJ. As a result, he had a number of open\nlegal judgments filed against him, including an $85,000 lien by the IRS.\n\nAfter resigning from his law firm in 2005, he moved to Rio de Janeiro and began a new career\nas a blogger for the Internet magazine Sa/on. He wrote fierce, and often brilliant, polemics\nagainst US government surveillance and other perceived intrusions on personal privacy The extent\nof his bitter antagonism to the activities of the “surveillance state,” as he called it, was reflected in\nthe title of his 2007 book, How Would a Patriot Act? Defending American Values from a\nPresident Run Amok. His position on surveillance was unrelenting, even when it came to the\npresident. “By ordering illegal eavesdropping, the president had committed crimes and should be\nheld accountable for them,” Greenwald wrote. | When Barack Obama became President in\n2009, Greenwald also attacked him for breaking the law by “ordering illegal eavesdropping.”\nBecause of his opposition to President Obama, he contributed money to the libertarian campaign\nof Ron Paul, the same candidate to whom Snowden gave money.\n\nIn August 2012, he had transferred his provocative blog, which had amassed a following of\nnearly one million readers (including Snowden), from Sa/on to the Guardian. The British\nnewspaper also had a powerful anti-surveillance position, having first published the Wikileaks\ndocuments that had been illicitly leaked by Private Bradley Manning and published by Assange in\n2010.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020229",
