  "text": "Lessons in diversification\n\nThere are only few examples of countries that successfully managed diversification\naway from primary dependence. The examples of Malaysia and Norway suggest that a\nsound institutional framework, robust fiscal framework, supportive public sector\nindustrial policies, appropriate business climate and human capital are important factors\nin enabling successful diversification away from the oil sector. A backdrop of low oil\nprices exacerbates diversification challenges but also provides impetus for change.\n\nSaudi comprehensive reforms follow standard template to shift gears\n\nThe Saudi NTP broadly follows the generally accepted template of comprehensive\nmacro- and micro- reforms needed to diversify beyond the hydrocarbon sector, in our\nview. The literature suggests successful diversification entails ideally a combination of\nthree types of innovations: processes, products and organizations. Enhancement in\nprocesses would enhance productivity, new products would support emergence of new\nsectoral growth drivers, and improved micro- and macro-governance would help sustain\nproduction gains. The key to furthering the development path would be to move from an\ninitial labour- and capital-intensive phase towards a phase focused on increasing\nproductivity growth through higher value-added sectors.\n\nThis will require the retention of white-collar workers, steady progress on institution-\nbuilding, an increase non-hydrocarbon FDI, horizontal and vertical integration, a broader\nmanufacturing base including at first through sectors with competitive advantage\n(downstream or energy-intensive ones), greater integration into the global value chain\nthrough enhanced trade relations, as well as education and business climate reform to\novercome structural rigidities, in our view.\n\nMedium-term diversification may require Fx reform\n\nAs diversification progresses, the case for increased Fx flexibility and making space for\nautonomous monetary policy conduct is likely to gradually take shape. Presumably, such\na move would require putting in place a supportive institutional structure which is\ncurrently broadly lacking. It would also await improvements in productivity growth and\nthe development of competitive local industries to minimize a potential Dutch disease\neffect on infant or other sectors. A fairly valued real effective exchange rate (REER)\nwould support efficient allocation of production factors across sectors and improve\ncompetitiveness of the tradable goods sector.\n\nMalaysia case study highlights the role of supportive public sector\n\nMalaysia’s diversification away from primary commodities relied on a series of National\nIndustrial Policies and Industrial Master Plans to promote the manufacturing sector.\nFocus was given to sectors with high export potential, and efforts were taken to create\nlinkages with other sectors and to deepen interconnection with other industries. Growth\nstrategies also aimed to develop local technological capabilities and clusters of\nindustrial development, similar to the localization and industrial strategies spearheaded\nby the Saudi National Transformation Plan.\n\nOS Merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 31\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016141",
