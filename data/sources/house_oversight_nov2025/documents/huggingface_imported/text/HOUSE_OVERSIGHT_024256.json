Course Description \nThis course offers a rigorous introduction to the field of cyberlaw. We will investigate the \nevolving nature of online architecture and activities, and the ways in which law has been, and \nwill be, leveraged to influence them. \nCourse themes include the complex interaction between Internet governance organizations and \nsovereign states, the search for balance between the ease of disseminating information online \nand the interest of copyright holders, privacy advocates, and others in controlling that \ndissemination, and the roles of intermediaries and platforms in shaping what people can and \ncannot do online. The course will include an array of learning and teaching methods. Students \nwill be expected to participate in a variety of activities. \nII. Class Schedule \nAfternoon \nSession \nMorning \nSession \nThe class meets every day from January 3rd to January 13th in \nMilstein West AB. Each day will be divided into three phases: the \nmorning session from 10:30am to noon, lunch from noon to 12:45pm, \nand the afternoon session from 12:45pm to 2pm. Lunch will be \nprovided. \nA more detailed schedule of the topics we will be covering each day \nfollows below. \nTopics (2 per day other than the last day) \nDay 1: Introduction, Right to Be Forgotten and Jurisdiction \nDay 2: Copyright, DRM debate between Professor Ito and Professor Zittrain (afternoon session) \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024256 \nDay 3: Cryptocurrency \nDay 4: Private Infrastructures for Government Surveillance, John DeLong/Bruce Schneier talk \n(morning session) \nDay 5: Net Neutrality and Internet Architecture, Dialogue with Andy Ellis (afternoon session) \nDay 6: Weaponized Social, Open discussion with John Palfrey (morning session) \nDay 7: Free vs. Proprietary Code and Content, Dialogue with David Clark (afternoon session) \nDay 8: Governance, Artificial Intelligence \nDay 9: Conclusion \nIII. Class Requirements \nThe purpose of this class is to give students a sense of the historical battles of the Internet, what \ndifferent actors were thinking, what they were trying to accomplish, and what levers they pulled \nin order to select for specific outcomes. Students should apply what they have learned from \nhistorical examples to a current Internet issue discussed in class and describe in a 12-15 page \npaper what a viable solution might look like. Solutions could take the form of a policy \nrecommendation, project proposal, or code. The paper or project proposal will be due on \nFriday, January 20th, and may be submitted by email to Samantha Bates at \nsbates@law.harvard.edu. \nIV. Class Materials \nThere is no required textbook for this class. All readings will be available online on the class \nH20 playlist: https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/playlists/51511. \nWe will have a slack channel for the class.

We aspire to the implausible: a nine-day introduction to the unusual dynamics of the \nworld's digital space, sufficient for a strategic understanding of what makes it difficult (but far \nfrom impossible) to regulate or shape; who's trying to do it nonetheless; and how such efforts \nhave fared over the past twenty years, with an eye towards lessons for influencing the space \nand the behavior within it today. \nIn addition to offering some frameworks for thinking about Internet architecture and policy, and \nthe curious open and generative nature of the phenomenon, we will delve into the net as a \ncontingently global phenomenon, and the way that complicates regulation by traditional \nsovereigns. Our case study will be the current debates around implementation of Europe's \"right \nto be forgotten\" in search engine results. As you complete the readings, you might see how \nyou'd answer the question of what a state like France's view should be towards the scope of its \nRTBF regulation, and whether the kind of \"zoning\" described in the Cato Institute article from \nthirteen years ago (!), is realizable and desirable. \nReadings: \n• C.P.

Academic \ntechnologies brought into the mainstream made it trivial to prepare and distribute perfect copies \nof copyrighted work without permission -- and the comparatively powerful organizations \nrepresenting copyright holders saw this as an existential threat. \nWe will read some of the \"grim joy\" experienced by Internet freedom types in dancing on the \ngrave of copyright in the mid-1990s -- and immerse in some of the law and policy changes \neffected in the United States to deal with the problem without running up against the equities of \nrapidly-growing intermediaries of online and Internet service providers (turns out, there's a \ndifference). \nThe copyright wars revealed a variety of strategies that we'll look at with the benefit of years of \nhindsight, including lawsuits against network providers, software makers, and individual users \nboth sending and receiving files, as well as technical changes designed to make it more difficult \nto share items that wish not to be shared. Ultimately we are drawn to the question of whether \nthe wars were won by one side or another, or whether it's more accurate to say that they simply \nfaded away. What issues today feel make-or-break, yet could simply fade rather than be \nresolved, and why? \nWe'll end the day with a peek into, and practice of, a current intense if obscure debate: that of \nwhether digital rights management hooks should be placed into standards for Web browsers. \nReadings: \n• John Perry Barlow, \"The Economy of Ideas,\" Wired (March 1994) \nhttp://archive.wired.com/wired/archive/2.03/economy.ideas.html?topic=&topic set=  \narchived at https://perma.cc/P82S-RZP3. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024260 \n• Matthew Green, Napster Opens Pandora's Box: Examining How File-Sharing Services \nThreaten the Enforcement of Copyright on the Internet, 63 Oh.

At the ripe year of \n2017, are there still digital disruptions to be had? \nThe phenomenon (and increasing literal value) of cryptocurrency -- and, for that matter, the \nfoundational blockchain technologies on which it can be based -- seems to indicate that there \nare still surprises from left field.

How successful is such surveillance, and \nwill it continue to be effective as the public reacts by potentially adopting privacy-enhancing \ntools? How successful do we want it to be, and how might frameworks agreeable within \njurisdictions that embrace the rule of law be used or abused within those that do not? \nReadings: \n• David O'Brien, Matt Olsen, Bruce Schneier, and Jonathan Zittrain, et al. \"Don't Panic. \nMaking Progress on the 'Going Dark' Debate,\" The Berkman Center for Internet & \nSociety at Harvard University (Feb 1, 2016) \nhttps://cyber.law.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont Panic Making Progress on  \nGoing Dark Debate.pdf archived at https://perma.cc/NT9M-ELAG. \n• John Cassidy, \"Lessons from Apple vs. The F.B.I.,\" The New Yorker (March 29, 2016) \nhttp://www.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lessons-from-apple-versus-the-f-b-i  \narchived at https://perma.cc/282P-A7MS. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 024263 \n• Susan Landau, Testimony for House Judiciary Committee Hearing on \"The Encryption \nTightrope: Balancing Americans' Security and Privacy\" (March 1, 2016) \nhttps://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/Landau-Written-Testimony.pdf \narchived at https://perma.cc/N9D9-JTYQ. \n• Bruce Schneier, \"Data Is a Toxic Asset, So Why Not Throw It Out?,\" Schneier on \nSecurity (March 1, 2016) \nhttps://www.schneier.com/essays/archives/2016/03/data is a toxic asse.html archived \nat https://perma.cc/7NUL-W5YJ. \n• Stewart Baker, \"Why the NSA Needs Your Phone Calls...and why you (probably) \nshouldn't worry about it,\" Foreign Policy (June 6, 2013) \nhttp://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/06/why-the-nsa-needs-your-phone-calls/ archived at \nhttps://perma.cc/YE3N-TSWU. \n• [OPTIONAL] Harold Abelson et al., \"Keys Under Doormats: Mandating insecurity by \nrequiring government access to all data and communications,\" CSAIL (Jul 7, 2015). \nhttps://www.schneier.com/academic/paperfiles/paper-keys-under-doormats-CSAIL.pdf \narchived at https://perma.cc/2L3U-QST8. \nDay 5: Internet Architecture/Net Neutrality \nWe increasingly assume the availability of commodity networking -- a flat fee for access -- even \nas the way in which we experience the Internet is evolving through a curious microeconomics, a \nmishmash of policies designed to subsidize or regulate access, and a sometime ability to \narbitrage around arrangements through technologies to facilitate access sharing and virtual \ntunneling. \nHow is Internet access likely to evolve, and what choices exist for polities with particular ideals \nabout how it should work? \nDiscussion will include Andy Ellis, Berkman Klein Center Fellow and CSO of Akamai, one of the \nmost important companies that people haven't heard of. \nReadings: \nNet Neutrality \n• [FOR REFERENCE] Net Neutrality timeline, Public Knowledge: \nhttp://whatisnetneutrality.org/timeline archived at https://perma.cc/L8JE-QYP8. \n• Tim Wu, Network Neutrality, Broadband Discrimination.

To what extent should new technologies be \nshaped and shared by anyone without gatekeeping? 2017 may find the Internet in middle age. \nDo its puzzles suggest anything about whether and how to resolve governance questions for \nmore newly mainstreamed technologies like machine learning and other Al? \nIn addition to the challenges that the Internet has provided in regulation and governance, the \ninability to really understand what many \"learned\" algorithms do, and their ability to have \nproperties and abilities beyond the capabilities of their initial designers, presents additional \nchallenges when thinking about whether and how to regulate the research, as well as the \ndeployment, of Al. Phenomena like digital currencies and distributed Al systems reprises the \nideas and challenges of Barlow's declaration of independence of cyberspace. \nReadings: \nGovernance: loT Security \n• J.M.
