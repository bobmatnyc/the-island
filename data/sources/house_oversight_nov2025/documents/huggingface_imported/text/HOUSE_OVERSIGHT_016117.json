  "text": "Public Investment Fund to gain prominence\n\nThe restructuring of the Public Investment Fund (PIF) is likely to allow greater focus on\nachieving a diversified foreign asset base which could support in turn the build-up of\nnon-oil revenues. According to Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman,\ngovernment ownership of Saudi Aramco would be transferred to the PIF, which will be\ntransformed into a SWF that will look to increase its overseas assets (from 5% of total\nto 50% of total by 2020) following its recapitalization and the proceeds of Aramco IPO.\nThe PIF would hold on-paper a vast amount of wealth post-IPO (USS2trn, according to\nthe Deputy Crown Prince, the bulk of which would be Saudi Aramco) as ownership of\nSaudi Aramco is transferred to the PIF, but it would only be able to deploy the cash\nproceeds of the monetized Aramco stake in the near-term, in our view. We think the\nPIF’s transformation is still at a relatively early stage for now.\n\nRoom to grow PIF stature and budget contribution\n\nThe restructuring of the PIF is likely to allow further diversification of foreign assets,\nwhich will in turn increase the share of investment income in the budget over time. We\nestimate that in 2015 investment income transferred to the budget stood at USS9.9bn\n(1.5% of GDP), which entails transfers of US$4bn from the PIF and USS5bn from SAMA.\nThese transfers pale in comparison to the estimated budgetary contributions among\nmain GCC peers. We estimate that the rate of return (investment income) on foreign\nassets of SAMA, government entities and the private sector averaged c2% over the past\n8 years, which already suggests some exposure to riskier asset classes, in our view. As\nthe PIF gains importance, it will become more prominent in the examination of the\nbreakdown of the Saudi Net International Investment Position .\n\nTransitioning to an Abu Dhabi model\n\nIt will be interesting to see how the restructuring of the PIF into an SWF works out in\npractice. We hypothesise that it may be that, on top of the monetization of Aramco's\nstake sale, PIF could get a portion of the assets of SAMA. In this scenario, we would\neffectively transition to the Abu Dhabi and Kuwait model where the central bank holds\nlittle reserves and non-transparent SWFs are what matters both in terms of flow and\nstock. Foreign assets purchases of the PIF would also have to be managed within the\noverall Balance of Payments (BoP) framework as they could lead to drains on SAMA\nreserves in the near term. Over time, Saudi Arabia could decide to emulate the Norway\nmodel, which would entail a more prudent use and conduct of fiscal policy, in our view.\n\nChart 1: PIF budget contributions small versus GCC SWF contributions Chart 2: High rate of return suggests foreign assets well diversified\n40 40 <= |mplied rate of return with respect to IIP assets (%) 30\nmUS$bn m@%ofGDP m% of total revenues Implied rate of return with respect to SAMA reserve assets (%)| ~”\n35 === Net income balance (% of GDP, rhs) 25\n30 2.0\n25 1.5\n20 1.0\n15 a\n10 0.0\n5 -0.5\n-1.0\n0 jaa] N tse] st lo co ~ Cc fo?) f=] —_ N oO t+ wo\n. . 7 : : oS SoS o oo So So oS So Oo x x x x —- x\nQatar Abu Dhabi Kuwait SaudiArabia Dubai RRS RRRKRKRKCKKRRKRKKAA\nSource: Haver, IMF, Saudi Ministry of Finance, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. 2015 data, Source: Haver, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.
