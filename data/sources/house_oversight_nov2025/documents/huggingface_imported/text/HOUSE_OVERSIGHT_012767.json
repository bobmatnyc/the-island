  "text": "new line of mice with a special accessory: an upgraded memory and learning system. When these new\nand improved mice ran through an IQ test, they outperformed normal mice.\n\nTsien pulled off an extraordinary engineering trick, creating a lineage of smarter mice. This is\ncowboy science, showing the power of genetic tampering to open the door to evolutionary changes. In a\nworld of competition, one would imagine that selection should favor these smart mice who have better\nrecall of essential foraging routes, previous social interactions, and places to rest out of harm’s way from\npredators. But in biology, there are always trade-offs. Benefits in one area of life are often accompanied\nby costs in others.\n\nSeveral months after Tsien’s report, a follow-up study of the same memory-enhanced mice\nappeared in print, also in a distinguished scientific journal. But this time there was no media fanfare. The\nnew work was carried out by Min Zhuo at Washington University, an ex-member of Tsien’s lab and a co-\nauthor of the original paper. Zhuo’s new paper confirmed that memory-enhanced mice were indeed\nsmarter, but also showed that they were more sensitive to pain, licking their wounds more and for longer\nperiods of time than normal mice. Though it is unclear whether Zhuo’s results reveal heightened pain\nsensitivity, stronger memories for pain, or some combination of these and other processes, what is clear is\nthat the engineering that led to smarter mice led to much more.\n\nTsien and Zhuo’s work shows that even with targeted, artificial changes in the underlying\nbiology, unanticipated consequences are common. It also shows that deep within the biology of every\norganism lies hidden capacities and potential for change. Unleashing these sub rosa capacities can have\nboth beneficial and costly consequences for the individual and group.\n\nThe idea I develop in this chapter is that our capacity for evil evolved as an incidental, but natural\nconsequence of our uniquely engineered brain. Unlike any other species, our brain promiscuously\ncombines and recombines thoughts and emotions to create a virtually limitless range of solutions to an\never-changing environment. This new form of intelligence enabled us to solve many problems, but two\nare of particular interest given their adaptive consequences: killing competitors and punishing cheaters in\na diversity of contexts. But like the painful fall-out from artificially engineering a smarter mouse, so too\nwas there fall-out from the natura/ engineering of a smarter human: a species that experiences pleasure\nfrom harming others. This is part of the recipe for evil.\n\nThis chapter sets out the evidence to support the idea that evil evolved as an incidental\nconsequence of our brain’s design. I begin by discussing the two general processes that landed us in the\nunforeseen and uninhabited niche of evildoers: the evolution of byproducts and promiscuous connections\nwithin the human brain. Because these are general processes, we will take a short reprieve from matters\n\nspecifically evil.\n\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 21\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012767",
