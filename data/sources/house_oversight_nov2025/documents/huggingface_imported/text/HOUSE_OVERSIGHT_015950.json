It is\nstraightforward to put these notes into a synthesizer and play the piece\nof music. I have provided a link to such a piece. Warning: once you listen\nto this you will have been ‘creatively inoculated’\n\nThis resulting piece of music, based on the transliteration of a proof,\nis non-computable. You might immediately argue with this, “The piece\nof music was translated from proof text to music file using a computer. It\nis clearly computed. but this is not my point. The music could not have\ncome into existence in our Universe as a result of a computation. It is a\ncomputable translation of a non-computable string. It could not have\nbeen generated solely by a computer: It was done in two steps, the first of\nwhich could not have been computed.\n\nIf, up to this time, our Universe has never contained a piece of\nmusic that was generated non-computationally, it does now. If you listen\nto this piece, you will find it impossible not to be somewhat inspired by\nit. You cannot erase the experience from your memory. And once you\nhave heard it you will have been creatively inoculated. I have defeated\nDaniel Dennett and his like, and given you creative freedom!\n\nwww.jamestagg.com/noncompmusic\n\nHaving made at least some music above the Turing limit I could\ndeclare victory but I want to go further. Using the same reduction method,\nI believe we can show all art is above the limit. First let’s attempt novels\nand plays. Do you enjoy those crime novels by Agatha Christie and Colin\nDexter? It must be possible to construct a plot sufficiently complex, and\na murder sufficiently baffling that it exceeds the logic limit. I could keep\nextending this idea to provide any number of examples and, therefore,\nprove all art and creative output is above the logic limit.\n\nThere are many other arts we could apply this argument too. In\nthe visual domain there are non-computable images. In principle, it is\npossible, to draw or paint things beyond the capability of a computer.\nRoger Penrose has created non-computable visual puzzles such as tiling\nan infinite plain with special jigsaw pieces. Creating an image containing\na solution to his visual puzzle is non-computable.\n\nThis extension argument also applies to me. There is an argument\nthat I am a finite being and therefore can be simulated by a computer.\nSince I can be simulated by a computer, I am the same as a computer\nand therefore incapable of non-computable thought. The argument is as\nfollows: James Tagg will have during his life a finite number of inputs and,\nequally, a finite set of outputs. This means you could model me using a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015950",
