  "text": "met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of the British\nseparatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, USA, to a\nfundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the Italians of Lega\nand 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the model anywhere”.\n\nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In\nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries\nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in the\nfuture the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because the\nrelationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and published in\nthe scandal book “Fire and Fury”. “Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,” Bannon says now\nparaphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. Hell in this case would\nbe the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The “army of darkness” is already among us.\n\nIn Sacratissimo Corde Jesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph.\n\nis 2k 3s 24 Os 2g 2\n\nBenjamin Harnwell\nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees\nDignitatis Humanae Institute\n\nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae\n44 Via delle Fornaci\n\nRoma 00165\nITALY\n\n@ben_harnwell\nwww.dignitatishumanae.com\n\nIl giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon ~  £ ha scritto:\n\nWhat does this say???\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\nFrom: Maria Luisa (i ii i>\nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT\n\nTo: Steve Bannon [i '-, Preate Alexandra <i\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019303",
