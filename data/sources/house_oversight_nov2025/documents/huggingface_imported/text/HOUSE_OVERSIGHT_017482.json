  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nGigi Jordan\n\nI am currently representing a woman named Gigi Jordan, who admittedly killed her 8 year old\nseverely autistic child and tried to take her own life at the same time. There is considerable\nevidence that her child was being sexually abused by his biological father and Gigi was in great\nfear that her former husband was trying to kill her. If he succeeded, she believed that her autistic\nchild would be left at the mercy of his sexually abusive father. Gigi decided that this horrible\nchoice of evils required her to protect her child in the only way she knew how: by ending his life\nalong with hers. We are in the process of preparing for her trial.\n\n395\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017482",
