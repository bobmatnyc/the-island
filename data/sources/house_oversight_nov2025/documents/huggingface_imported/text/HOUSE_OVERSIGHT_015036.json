And when L/fe magazine published a favorable\narticle about him, the FBI sent a poison-pen letter to the editor calling\nKrassner “a raving, unconfined nut.” George Carlin responded, “The FBI\nwas right. This man is dangerous—and funny; and necessary.” While\nabortion was illegal, Krassner ran an underground referral service, and as\nan antiwar activist, he became a co-founder of the Yippies (Youth\nInternational Party). Krassner's one-person show won an award from the\nL.A. Weekly. He received an ACLU (Upton Sinclair) Award for dedication to\nfreedom of expression. At the Cannabis Cup in Amsterdam, he was\ninducted into the Counterculture Hall of Fame — “my ambition,” he\nclaims, “since | was three years old.” He’ s won awards from Playboy,\nthe Feminist Party Media Workshop, and in 2010 the Oakland branch of\nthe writers organization PEN honored him with their Lifetime Achievement\nAward. “I'’ m very happy to receive this award,” he concluded in his\nacceptance speech, “and even happier that it wasn’ t posthumous.\"--\npaulkrassner.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015036",
