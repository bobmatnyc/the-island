  "text": "The Autobiography of Monica Lewinsky\n\nThe following is an exclusive excerpt trom an autobiography-in-\n\nprogressy by Monica Lewinsky, titled Going Down in History. 7he\nmanuscript was leaked to The Realist by, of course, a reliable source.\n#\n\n| am not an airhead. I’ m a victim, partly of my own making. And\nmostly, I' ma political pawn of the spin doctors. There are several books\nbeing written about the White House scandal, but only a few individuals\nknow what really happened, and only | know who / really am, which is why\n| have decided to write this book. | would write it even if | didn’ t need the\nmoney for legal expenses. My life may be ruined—at least my reputation\nwill be forever tainted—but the truth must be told.\n\n| don’ t like being a one-dimensional symbol. If anybody were to\ntake a free-association test, the psychiatrist would say “Monica\nLewinsky” and the patient would immediately respond “Oral sex.\"\nMaybe soon my name will be in a crossword puzzle—the clue: eight letters\n\nacross—and the correct word will be “fellatio.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015144",
