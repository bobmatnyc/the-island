FORGIVE ME FOR CONTINUING WITH PETER’S RESPONSE TO MY RESPONSE TO
GORDON’S TWO POSTS.

| HAVE LEARNED DIRECTLY FROM PETER BUT MORE OFTEN INDIRECTLY—HE
HAS FORCED ME TO THINK THROUGH MATTERS AND IDENTIFY EXACTLY
WHERE HE IS WRONG.

TAM FINISHED WITH THAT NOW. LIFE IS SHORT AND MINE IS GETTING SHORTER
BY THE DAY, SO | WILL REPEAT MY PIECE AND PETER’S RESPONSE TO IT (IN
YELLOW) AND THEN MY CURRENT RESPONSE—IN CAPITAL LETTERS.

1 AM ALSO ADDING TWO NAMES TO GORDON’S LIST. DAVID HAIG WHO IS A
BRILLIANT EVOLUTIONARY GENETICIST AT HARVARD AND JEFFREY EPSTEIN
WHOIS A BRILLIANT FUND AND INVESTMENT MANAGER (PALM BEACH, NYC, US
VIRGIN ISLANDS) WITH BROAD SCIENTIFIC INTERESTS.

Dear Gruterites

Gordon has now brought the argument full circle and given the project a larger
meaning. The most powerful nation on earth, with the greatest power to vent
harm—or, in theory, confer benefits—is ruled by an organism that fits the definition
of a psychopath—of the narcissistic kind—or a malevolent narcissist. This presents
serious dangers that need to be addressed.

Peter Richerson has made several valuable points:

1—Causality could go entirely in the other direction than the one |
suggested—people avoid more psychopathic relatives the more experience they
have had due to closer relatedness. And the paper | attached does not allow
discrimination. The fact that psychopaths show only a weak and insignificant
tendency to migrate further from place of birth is mildly interesting but has nothing
to do with who is causing any difference in migration.

As far as I can think it through, selection pressures on psychopaths and relatives of
psychopaths should be roughly equal and therefore equally likely. Peter is biased
toward reaction by others, perhaps because of his bias toward “cultural”
explanations. First, psychopaths always have the first move in the co-evolutionary
struggle and relatives getting out of the way is the next move. Secondly, it is very
easy for a psychopath to simply discriminate against harming his relatives but
harder for them to study and react. Peter claims that they are often spotted early in
life which I heartily doubt.
