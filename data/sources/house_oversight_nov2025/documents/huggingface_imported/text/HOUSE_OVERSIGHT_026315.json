  "text": "One told us, “Bannon needs money to bankroll his political agenda. Epstein has plenty of\n\nmoney, and craves power and access.”\n\nBannon made an early-morning beeline to Epstein, even though Bannon may have\nburned bridges when he savaged Ivanka Trump over her criticism of Roy Moore, whom\nBannon backed despite claims the candidate had sexually harassed teens. Citing an\nallegation in -legal papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald\nTrump and Epstein had raped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to Ivanka,\n“What about the allegations about her dad and that 13-year-old?”\n\nEpstein has previously used his millions to cultivate the world’s most powerful — but has\n\nmostly given money to Democrats.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein’s private plane, dubbed “The Lolita\nExpress,” 26 times. Epstein is close to Prince Andrew and was a regular at Trump’s Mar-\n\na-Lago.\n\nTrump told New York magazine of Epstein in 2002, “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be\nwith. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are\n\non the younger side.”\n\nEpstein, 65, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served 13\n\nmonths in jail.\n\nLast year, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens.\nBannon’s rep didn’t comment. A lawyer for Epstein said, “Let me ask him,” but didn’t\n\nrespond by deadline.\n\nplease note\n\nThe information contained in this communication 1s\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
