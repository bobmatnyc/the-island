The three exceptions were China, North Korea (via\nChina) and Russia.\n\nThe only one of these three countries, or any other country, that Snowden is known to have\ndealt with directly during his 33 day stay in Hong Kong, was Russia. As previously discussed, he\nhad dealings with Russian “diplomatic representatives “, as Putin called them. Putin did not\nprovide the date of these contacts but he provided an intriguing clue. Snowden was identified to\nhim, according to Putin, not by name but merely as an “agent of special services.” Putin’s\ndescription suggests the meeting had taken place before Snowden became a household name on\nJune 9, 2013.\n\nFor his part, Snowden was evasive when discussing his contacts with Russia while still in\nHong Kong. When Lana Lam asked Snowden on June 12, 2013 whether he had already\nrequested asylum from the Russia government, he deferred, saying: “My only comment is that I\nam glad there are governments that refuse to be intimidated by great power.” As it turned out,\nSnowden was correct. The Russian government was not intimidated by the threats of reprisals by\nthe United States, as the Obama Administration would learn after his arrival in Russia on June 23,\n2013. But the only way that Snowden could not have known that fact on June 12\" was by being\nin contact with Russian officials prior to his interview with Lam. Of course, he may have had\nmultiple contacts on different dates with these officials. The Russian pro-government\nnewspaper Kommersant reported that Snowden had visited the Russian consulate on more than\none occasion and had been given a birthday celebration there on June 21, 2013.\n\nWhat we do know about Snowden’s interactions with the Russians in Hong Kong comes partly\nfrom Putin’s own description of them. Putin said, it will be recalled, that his decision to facilitate\nSnowden’s escape to Russia had been kicked all the way up the Russian chain of command for\nhim to personally decide Snowden’s fate. Presumably, this decision-making process began earlier\nthan June 21, 2013, when he reportedly came to the consulate. The question is: how much\nearlier? Since Snowden had arrived in Hong Kong on May 20\", 2013, his contacts with Russian\nofficials could have occurred as long as a month earlier. That would fit in with Snowden telling\nGellman on May 24\" that he needed his help in dealing with the diplomatic mission of an unnamed\ncountry. In any case, Putin tells us he learned an American “agent of the special services” had\ncontacted Russian diplomats because he wanted assistance. And Snowden did need assistance to\nescape from Hong Kong. As he had no visas, he would require the sort of assistance that could\nonly be provided by a government willing to defy the United States. The assistance came from\nRussia.\n\nNine days before Snowden boarded Aeroflot flight SU213 to Moscow on June 23\", the US had\nfiled a criminal complaint against him. It had also alerted Hong Kong authorities and Interpol\nwhen it unsealed the complaint on June 21, 2013. And on June 21st it had invalidated his U.S.\npassport (although he still had it in his possession at the Hong Kong Airport.) Since by this time\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020263",
