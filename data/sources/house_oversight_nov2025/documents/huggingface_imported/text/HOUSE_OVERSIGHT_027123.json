  "text": "states, such as Tunisia, Libya, and Egypt. I think it is likely to happen\nbefore too long.\n\nTB: What about Syria?\n\nDP: Assad’s power is steadily diminishing and I cannot see how his\nregime will remain long in power.\n\nTB: Should the United States get involved there?\n\nDP: No, Americans have no dog in this fight and nothing in the U.S.\nConstitution requires us to get involved in every foreign conflict. Two\nwretched forces are killing each other; just look at the ghastly videos of\nthe two sides torturing and executing the other. Listen also to what they\nare saying. It’s a civil war involving the bad and the worse. I don’t want\nthe U.S. government involved. That would mean bearing some moral\nresponsibility for what emerges, which I expect to be very unsavory.\n\nTB: So you are supporting the Obama position?\n\nDP: Yes, though he reaches it with far more angst. Also, there appears to\nbe some serious, clandestine U.S. support for the rebel forces. The\nSeptember 11 meeting in Benghazi between the Turkish and the American\nambassadors was very curious. They are both based in Tripoli, hundreds\nof miles away. What were they doing in Benghazi? Arranging for\nAmerican arms going via Turkey to Syria, 1t appears.\n\nTB: How important has Israel been to the revival of Islam?\n\nDP: It is a major factor in the neighboring states. But elsewhere, in\nMorocco, Iran, Malaysia, it has minor importance.\n\nTB: Since the “Arab Spring,” Israel seems increasingly beleaguered.\nDP: Not really, not yet, though I agree that it will be more beleaguered\nwith time. Its neighbors are so consumed with their own affairs that they\nhardly pay Israel attention. But once the neighbors get their houses in\norder, Israel will most likely face new difficulties.\n\nTB: You have questioned U.S. support for Islamic democracy, which\ndoes seem naive.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027123",
