  "text": "®) ROCKEFELLER & CO.\n\nA\n\niN\nNew Cot\n\n- A,\n\nBanks and insurance companies\nplay a vital role in our financial\nsystem, providing savings, fi-\nnancing, investment, and pay-\nment services to consumers and\nbusinesses of all sizes. Our mod-\nern economy requires a stable,\ntrustworthy, and efficient finan-\ncial services industry to function\nand grow. Active stewardship\ncan serve a role in maintaining a\nstrong financial system.\n\nBank managements should be\nmotivated to pursue best practic-\nes, having experienced the con-\nsequences of bad behavior long\nafter the Global Financial Crisis.\nTighter regulations, enacted in\nthe aftermath of the Global Fi-\nnancial Crisis, including Basel III\nand the Dodd-Frank Wall Street\nReform and Consumer Protec-\ntion Act, have increased capital\nrequirements and compliance\ncosts for financial institutions.\nThey have also limited aggressive\nforms of lending and risk-taking.\n\nIn addition, banks have also in-\ncurred substantial legal penalties\nfor poor conduct ranging from\nconsumer loan servicing, market\nmanipulation, fraudulent activity,\nand money laundering.\n\nHowever, while new regulations\nand legal settlements have placed\nincremental financial burdens\n\non the financial services in-\ndustry, banks and insurers have\nsince made substantial progress\nto comply with new rules and\nadjusted their business models\naccordingly. Balance sheets have\nbeen reinforced with additional\ncapital and liquidity, and tighter\nunderwriting. While this may limit\nloan growth, it has also result-\n\ned in reduced risk costs in their\nlending businesses. Banks have\nadded headcount in their compli-\nance and risk control divisions in\nan effort to monitor and prevent\nfuture misconduct.\n\nWith a new administration in\npower in the United States, there\nis some concern that an aggres-\nsive pullback of regulations is\nimminent. However, we believe\nthat higher quality banks and\ninsurers should remain conserva-\ntive in maintaining their increased\nregulatory capital, underwriting\nstandards, and compliance and\nrisk monitoring capabilities, as\nfailing to do so could draw the ire\nof legislators and regulatory bod-\nies, as well as the general public.\nThis could lead to additional costs\n\nITAIN\nCIAL\n\nthrough loan losses, further liti-\n\ngation expenses, and even more\nstringent regulations. We believe\nthat through active stewardship,\nwe can continue to promote re-\n\nsponsible practices among these\ncompanies.\n\nGoing forward, we expect banks\nand other financial institutions\nwith adjusted business models,\nthat exhibit greater stability in\nearnings and balance sheet qual-\nity to benefit financially in the\nlong run. A reduction of earnings\ncyclicality should result in higher\ninvestor confidence in dividend\npayouts over time, and financial\nstocks could see higher valuations\nas a result. Swedish banks are\n\na prime example. Highly capi-\ntalized by global standards, with\nminimal loan losses in their home\nmarket even during economic\ndownturns, Swedish banks have\nmaintained premium valuations\n(14x to 16x forward earnings, 1.6x\nto 2x book value) compared to\ntheir European peers (many trade\nat 10x to 12x forward earnings,\n<x book value). We believe this\nrepresents significant potential\nupside for long-term investors in\nthe sector.\n\nHOUSE_ OVERSIGHT _ 012076",
