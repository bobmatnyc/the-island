  "text": "single-owner DREs (e.g., SMLLCs) as corporations for employment tax purposes. 24 Thus, the\nentity now must use its own taxpayer identification number when it files and pays employment\ntaxes. 78 An individual owner of a DRE, however, is subject to self-employment tax and is not\ntreated as an employee of the disregarded entity for employment tax purposes. 22 This special\nemployment tax provision is applicable with respect to wages paid on or after 1/1/09. 2° The IRS\nalso recently updated its Employer Tax Guide to reflect the final regulations. 2*\n\nIn addition, the IRS issued a similar provision with respect to certain excise tax reporting,\nregistration, and payment obligations. 24 That provision treats an eligible single-owner DRE as a\nseparate entity for certain excise tax purposes. ** This special excise tax rule applies to liabilities\nimposed and actions first required or permitted in periods beginning on or after 1/1/08. **\n\nThe IRS also issued a final regulation under Section 1361 that mirrors the employment and\nexcise tax regulation provisions promulgated under Section 7701. = Like the check-the-box\nregulations’ rules, the QSub regulation treats a QSub as a corporation for employment and\nexcise tax purposes only. 22 The regulation relating to employment taxes applies with respect to\nwages paid on or after 1/1/09, but the excise tax provision applies to liabilities imposed and\nactions first required or permitted in periods beginning on or after 1/1/08. #4 The IRS probably\ndid not need to issue separate provisions under Section 1361 because Regs. 301.7701-\n2(c)(2)({iv) and (v) appear to cover QSubs as well as SMLLCs. The IRS did not issue special\nprovisions with respect to REITs, but Regs. 301.7701-2(c)(2)(iv) and (v) should also cover\nREITs. There is no authority explicitly extending these rules to grantor trusts.\n\nTax Liability Considerations\nA DRE, including an SMLLC, a QSub, and a QRS, is treated as a separate entity for purposes of:\n\n(1) Federal tax liabilities of the entity for any tax period for which the entity was not\ndisregarded,\n\n(2) Federal tax liabilities of any other entity for which the entity is liable.\n\n(3) Federal tax refunds or credits. “8\n\nThe regulations setting forth these exceptions apply after 3/31/04. 2 The following examples\nillustrate these exceptions to the general rule that DREs are treated as tax nothings.\n\nIf a domestic corporation merges (pursuant to a state law merger) into a domestic SMLLC owned\nby an individual, the SMLLC is the successor to the corporation, for state law purposes, and is\nliable for all of the corporation's debts. If the IRS sought to extend the statute of limitations on\nassessment with respect to a liability of the corporation for a tax year prior to the tax year in\nwhich the merger occurred, the SMLLC is liable for the corporation's taxes that remain unpaid,\nand, therefore, is the proper party to sign the consent to extend the period of limitations. “2 The\nresult would be the same if the SMLLC was a QSub or a QRS. **\n\nUsing this example, assume that for a tax year ending before the merger occurred the IRS\ndetermines that the corporation miscalculated and underreported its income tax liability. Because\nthe SMLLC is the successor to the corporation and is liable for the underpayment of the\ncorporation's taxes, the IRS may assess the deficiency directly against the SMLLC. “ In the event\nthat the SMLLC fails to pay the liability after notice and demand, the IRS can file a federal tax\nlien against all of the SMLLC's property and its rights to property.\n\nWith respect to QSubs and QRSs, their owners are not liable for deficiencies relating to a tax\nyear that precedes the year in which the QSub or QRS election is made, because the tax liability\nis for a tax year for which the QSub or QRS was not disregarded. “ As a result, the IRS may\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026587",
