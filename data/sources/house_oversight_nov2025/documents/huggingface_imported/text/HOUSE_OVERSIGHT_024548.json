KUE\n\nKUE is constituted as a Cayman islands exempted limited partnership under the Exempted Limited\nPartnership Law (2003 Revision) (the “ELP Law’). A Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership is\nconstituted by the signing of the relevant partnership agreement and its registration with the Registrar of\nExempted Limited Partnerships in the Cayman Islands.\n\nNotwithstanding registration, an exempted limited partnership is not a separate legal person distinct from\nits partners. Under Cayman Islands law, any property of the exempted limited partnership shall be held or\ndeemed to be held by the general partner, and if more than one then by the general partners jointly upon\ntrust, as an asset of the partnership in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement. Similarly,\nthe general partner for and on behalf of the partnership incurs the debts or obligations of the exempted\nlimited partnership. Registration under the ELP Law eniails that the partnership becomes subject to, and\nthe limited partners therein are afforded the limited liability and other benefits of the ELP Law.\n\nThe business of an exempted limited partnership will be conducted by its general partner(s) who will be\nliable for all debts and obligations of the exempted limited partnership to the extent the partnership has\ninsufficient assets. As a general matter, a limited partner of an exempted limited partnership will not be\nliable for the debts and obligations of the exempied limited partnership save (i) as expressed in the\npartnership agreement, (ii) if such limited partner becomes involved in the conduct of the partnership's\nbusiness or (iii) if such limited partner is obliged pursuant to Section 14(1) of the ELP Law to return a\ndistribution made to it where the exempted limited partnership is insolvent,\n\nThe Limited Partnership Agreement of KUE limits the liability and reduces the fiduciary duties of the\nGeneral Partner to the Limited Partners of KUE (the \"Limited Partners,” and, together with the General\nPartner, the “Partners”) to the full extent of applicable law. The Limited Partnership Agreement also\nrestricts the remedies available to the Limited Partners for actions that might otherwise constitute a\nbreach of the General Partner's fiduciary duties owed to the Limited Partners.
