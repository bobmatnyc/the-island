  "text": "Private Equity\n\nPrefer small/mid-cap buyout in US / emerging markets;\nUBS View distressed debt in Europe\ne Private equity deals in today's volatile and uncertain markets are conservatively financed, with an average\nequity cushion of 40%. We like mid-market buyout strategies, which offer long-term exposure to attractive\ncorporate assets and which rely less on large bank debt syndications.\n¢ Our house view sees large parts of Europe in a stagnation, and business owners are reluctant to sell their\ncompanies, reducing PE deal flow in the region significantly. We therefore prefer North America, which\nwill see continuous (albeit suboptimal) growth, and emerging markets, which show positive fundamentals.\ne Prices for PE transactions have corrected by around 10% this year, although they are still 20% above the\nattractive levels seen during the successful years between 2000 and 2004. However, significant dry powder\nand high cash positions at corporations keep competition high and hinder prices from falling much further.\n\nA Positive scenario Prefer small-/mid-cap buyout and secondaries\ne An abating Eurozone debt crisis and improved business confidence would increase deal flow and exit\nopportunities for private equity managers, but would also increase entry prices. In such a positive scenario,\nwe would perceive commitment strategies to secondary funds as attractive for building exposure to an\ninvested private equity portfolio.\n4 Negative scenario Prefer distressed debt\ne A renewed escalation of the debt crisis would significantly impact deal activity, the availability of debt\nand company owners' willingness to sell. At the same time, it would offer attractive opportunities within\ndistressed strategies and lower entry prices for long-term private equity investors.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching\nCredit markets\n\nWhy it matters\n\nAvailability of leverage and credit spreads are important signs of the health of\nbuyout markets. Small/mid caps are currently financed at 4.3x EBITDA (vs 4.6x\nfor large-caps) and are more attractive given their lower reliance on bank\nfinancing in a period of ongoing bank deleveraging.\n\nWe track deal/exit activity to understand the pressure to invest, future price\ndynamics and draw-down profiles for investors. More than USD 930bn of un-\ninvested capital and expiring investment periods will keep prices elevated.\n\nCapital overhang\n\nPurchasing prices (Enterprise Price multiples offer valuable insight into private company valuations. YTD\nvalue / EDITDA) May 2012, buyouts occurred at 8.1x, down from 8.8x seen in 2011. Large-cap\n\nbuyouts have come down 10% from the peak last year to 8.6x.\n\nUSD bn\n\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\nPrivate equity deals continue to be defensively\n\nWe prefer small-/mid-cap buyouts in North\nAmerica given the better economic\noutlook vs Europe, higher transaction\ncertainty and more attractive entry prices.\nInvestors looking for downside protection\nand stability during economic\nuncertainties can consider large-cap\nbuyouts in the US, which offer exposure\nto large, diversified companies at more\nattractive prices.\n\nIn Europe, the crisis and ongoing\ndeleveraging have led to attractive\nopportunities for special situations. We\nthus recommend investing in distressed\ndebt to benefit from the macroeconomic\nadjustment process and selling pressure\nfor many European banks.\n\nWe advise investors make an ongoing\nallocation to private equity in emerging\nmarkets, which offer an attractive way to\ncapture superior long-term growth and\nprovide access to small/mid-cap companies\nnot available through the stock market.\n\nfinanced amidst economic uncertainty\n\n100\n\n2005 2008 2007 2008\n\n2009\n\n2010 2011 YTD May 12\n\nmmm PE backed high yield issuances ([hs) —Equity cushion in LBOs (ths)\n\nSource: S&P, UBS CIO, as of May 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nEquity cushion (% of transaction\n\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Stefan Bragger, stefan.braegger@ubs.com\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nNote: We emphasize the equal importance of fund manager selection and the commitment strategy. Please note that private equity is an illiquid asset class and must be held at least until the end of the fund (10+ years).\nPlease note that UBS might not have a product available which reflects our UBS CIO private equity recommendations.
