  "text": "828\n\nPlaintiffs have failed to state a RICO claim\nagainst the moving Defendants. See id.;\nRedtail Leasing, Inc. v. Bellezza, 95 Civ.\n5191JFK), 1997 WL 603496, at *5\n(S.D.N.Y.1997) (“A defendant does not ‘di-\nrect? an  enterprise’s affairs under\n§ 1962(c) merely by engaging in wrongful\nconduct that assists the enterprise.”);\nDep’t of Econ. Dev. v. Arthur Andersen &\nCo., 924 F.Supp. 449, 466-67 (S.D.N.Y.\n1996) (providing services to racketeering\nenterprise is not directing the enterprise);\nLaSalle Natl Bank v. Duff & Phelps Cred-\nit Rating Co, 951 F.Supp. 1071, 1090\n(S.D.N.Y.1996) (same). Plaintiffs’ RICO\nclaim under § 1962(d) fails for the same\nreason. Plaintiffs have not alleged that\nthe moving Defendants were central fig-\nures in the underlying schemes or for con-\nspiracy liability under § 1962(d). The\nRICO claims against the moving Defen-\ndants are dismissed.\n\n3. TVPA\n\n[77,78] “The TVPA establishes a cause\nof action in federal court against an indi-\nvidual who, under actual or apparent au-\nthority, or color of law, of any foreign\nnation subjects an individual to torture or\nextrajudicial killing.” Arndt v. UBS AG,\n342 F.Supp.2d 182, 141 (E.D.N.Y.2004)\n(citing Flores, 343 F.3d at 153); 28 U.S.C.\n§ 13850 note. Only individuals maybe sued\nunder the TVPA. Arndt, 342 F.Supp.2d at\n141 (citing Friedman v. Bayer Corp., No.\n99 Civ. 3675, 1999 WL 33457825, at *2\n\n39. The ATA defines international terrorism as:\nactivities that—(A) involve violent acts or\nacts dangerous to human life that are a\nviolation of the criminal laws of the United\nStates or of any State, or that would be a\ncriminal violation if committed within the\njurisdiction of the United States or of any\nState; (B) appear to be intended—to intimi-\ndate or coerce a civilian population; (ii) to\ninfluence the policy of a government by\nintimidation or coercion; or (iii) to affect\nthe conduct of a government by assassina-\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\n(E.D.N.Y. Dec. 15, 1999)). Accordingly, to\nthe extent Plaintiffs have not already with-\ndrawn these claims, the TVPA claims are\ndismissed against Al Rajhi Bank, Saudi\nAmerican Bank, Arab Bank, Al Baraka\nInvestment & Development Corp., NCB,\nSaudi Binladin Group, and the SAAR Net-\nwork. Similarly, there have been no alle-\ngations that Saleh Abdullah Kamel or Adel\nBatterjee acted under color of law and,\ntherefore, the TVPA claims against these\nindividuals are dismissed as well.\n\n4. ATA\n\n[79,80] The ATA provides a civil rem-\nedy for “[a]lny national of the United\nStates injured in his or her person, proper-\nty, or business by reason of an act of\ninternational terrorism, or his or her es-\ntate, survivors, or heirs.” 18 U.S.C.\n§ 2338(a).° To adequately plead the pro-\nvision of material support under this sec-\ntion, a plaintiff would have to allege that\nthe defendant knew about the terrorists’\nillegal activities, the defendant desired to\nhelp those activities succeed, and the de-\nfendant engaged in some act of helping\nthose activities. Boim I, 291 F.3d at\n1023; see also Boim v. Quranic Literacy\nInst., 340 F.Supp.2d 885, 906-913 (N.D.III.\n2004) (“Boum IIT”) (granting summary\njudgment against two entity defendants\nwhere record evidence demonstrated the\ncharities’ concession that Hamas used ter-\nrorism in pursuit of its goals, the organiza-\ntions’ repeated desire to help Hamas by\n\ntion or kidnapping; and (C) occur primarily\noutside the territorial jurisdiction of the\nUnited States, or transcend national bound-\naries in terms of the means by which they\nare accomplished, the persons they appear\nintended to intimidate or coerce, or the\nlocale in which their perpetrators operate\nor seek asylum.\n\n18 U.S.C. § 2331(1). For now, the Court\n\nassumes the attacks of September 11 were an\n\nact of international terrorism.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017893",
