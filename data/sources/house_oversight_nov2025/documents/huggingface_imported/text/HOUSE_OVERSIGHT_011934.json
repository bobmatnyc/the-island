He’s someone who likes to have sex with venerable underage girls, including 12 year old\ngirls who are trafficked into the US under the guise that they will become models. His partner in\ncrime was Jean Luc Brunel, owner and ‘talent scout’ of the MC2 “modeling agency’. Epstein\ncoincidently invested a million bucks in the MC2 kiddie-perating modeling agency and let\nBrunel use his privet jet.\n\nThe FBI thinks Epstein has assaulted/molested about 40 or so young girls. So he’s going to\nprison for the rest of his life right? Wrong.\n\nWhen faced with the best defense lawyers money could buy, the prosecutors wimped out and\nmade a plea bargain so light it boggles the mind. This kid-raping bastard only had to please\nguilty to two MINOR charges and gets a private cell, a cell he gets to leave on a “work release\nprogram” by the way.\n\nNow, I am not blaming his defense attorneys. They were doing their job and, under our\nconstitution, a festering anus like Epstein has the right to the best attorneys he can afford.\n\n] am livid with the prosecuting attorneys. It was their job to do everything in their power to bring\nthis vomit-inducing shit-sack to justice. Instead, they decided to gutlessly pander to his wealth,\nprivilege, and powerful defense team. They rolled over and did everything but send in another\nkid to give this fucker a hand-job. So this vermin got away with raping 12 year old girls because\nthe prosecuting attorneys couldn’t find a single testicle/ovary to share among them.\n\nAnd do you know what their chicken-shit kowtowing to Epstein has wrought? It’s opened the\ndoor for other child-sex traffickers to get fighter sentences for their crimes too. Why should they\nhave to pay when he didn’t? After all, it was just girls they were trafficking for sex with\ndisgusting older males (1 refuse to call something like Epstein a “man”; it insults men) ... they\nweren't harming anything of any value in our culture!\n\nI'm a feminist because I think girls & women have value. What a crying, fucking shame there\nwasn't one feminist in the prosecutors office to go after this monster and punish him. What a pity\nother hell-spawn might get away with trafficking girls for sex more easily because of the shit-\nfor-brains attorneys who let Epstein get away with his crimes.\n\nMy eyeballs are melting with rage.\n\nNever mind. They aren’t melting. It’s just tears of helpless and despairing rage against an unjust\nlegal system and the cultural devaluation of women and girls.\n\n23\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011934",
