  "text": "1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\n\nThe following summary is qualified in its entirety by the more detailed information appearing elsewhere in this\nMemorandum. You should carefully consider the information set forth under “Risk Factors”. The term “KUE” refers\nonly to Knowledge Universe Education L.P, a Cayman Islands exempted limited partnership. The terms “Knowledge\nUniverse Education”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” and “our” refer to KUE and, where applicable, its subsidiaries, and\ndo not refer to the Agents. In November 2005, KLC separated its education operations (“KLC OpCo”) from its real\n\nestate assets (“KLC PropCo’).\n\n1.1. Company Overview\n\nKUE is the third largest for-profit education company in the world and the largest for-profit education\ncompany in the pre-school to 12th grade segment (“pre-K-12”) in the world. While the Company's\noperations are currently based within the U.S., the proceeds from this transaction will be used primarily to\nexpand KUE’s education platform both globally and across the pre-K-12 education continuum. KUE's\nexisting portfolio of assets consists of:\n\n(i) KLC OpCo, the leading early childhood education\n(“ECE”) company with 2,507 locations in 39 states Knowledge Universe KUE Management Inc.\nand the District of Columbia and nearly two and a SCedo mae (General Partner)\nhalf times larger than its next closest competitor in 17.9% to 40.0%\"\nterms of revenue;\n\nKnowledge Learning K42 Inc.\n(ii) KLC PropCo, one of the largest education based cool on tele\n\nreal estate portfolios in the U.S. consisting of 845\nearly childhood centers located in 37 states; and\n\n(iii) A significant interest in k12, an online curriculum\nprovider and kindergarten through 12th grade management company, currently serving over\n25,000 students as the largest operator of online virtual schools in the U.S.\n\nThe principal owners of KUE are Michael Milken, Lowell Milken and Steven Green (collectively the\n“Principals”). Michael Milken and Lowell Milken each has more than two decades of experience in the\neducation sector through involvement in several for-profit and not-for-profit initiatives. Steven Green,\nformer U.S. ambassador to Singapore, has more than two decades of experience as an international\nindustrialist leading major corporate restructurings and expansions in manufacturing, housing, consumer\nproducts, retail and real estate enterprises. The Company represents the Principals’ sole vehicle for\nequity investment opportunities in the pre-K-12 sector going forward.\n\nThe Principals founded the Company and its affiliated companies over the past decade based on their\nvision of a world where competition for human capital? is becoming the driving force of economic\nprosperity. To remain competitive in the world economy, countries will be forced to invest heavily in the\ndevelopment of their human capital. The Principals believe that an investment made in an individual's\neducation, especially at a young age, is the most effective way to build human capital and thereby\nincrease that individual’s lifelong productivity. As the largest for-profit provider of ECE in the world, the\nCompany is well positioned to capitalize on these trends.\n\n’ The 12.4% minority position is held by various investors.\n\n? KUE’s ownership varies depending on the liquidation value or sale value of k12 and according to the preference of the various securities KUE owns,\nAt higher valuations, KUE's percentage ownership is lower, See “k12 Inc, (k12) — k12 Equity.”\n\n* The economic theory of Human Capital Policy was first published by University of Chicago professor James Heckman in Human Capital Policy, dated\nAugust 2002,\n\n19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024452",
