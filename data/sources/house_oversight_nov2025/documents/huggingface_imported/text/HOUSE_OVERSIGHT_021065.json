  "text": "The Challenge Before Us\n\nPolicymakers, businesses and citizens need to share responsibility for\npast failures and develop a plan for future successes.\n\nPast generations of Americans have responded to major challenges\nwith collective sacrifice and hard work.\n\nWill ours also rise to the occasion?\n\nKP\ni USA Inc. | Summary 447\n\nCurrent Observations About America...\n\n¢ On many fronts, USA Inc. is in great shape, but it has one big problem —\nUSA Inc. spends too much and, in effect, is maxing out its credit card. USA\nInc. must address the problem.\n\n° In 2009, 64% of America’s revenue went to Social Security, Medicare &\nMedicaid, compared with 31% in 1980 and 20% in 1970.\n\n¢ Using current projections, 100% of America’s revenue in 2025 will go to Social\nSecurity, Medicare, Medicaid and Net Interest Expense.\n\n¢ This raises the question, ‘How will America pay for the likes of education,\nnational defense, homeland security, infrastructure improvement, R&D, law\nenforcement, postal service, etc.?’\n\n¢ USA Inc.’s fundamental tradeoff is that it must balance its FUTURE\n(education) with its PRESENT (national defense & homeland security) and\nits PAST (Social Security & Medicare & Medicaid).\n\nSource: 2009 data per White House OMB, 2025 forecast per CBO’s Alternative Fiscal Scenario.\na USA Inc. | Summary 448\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021065",
