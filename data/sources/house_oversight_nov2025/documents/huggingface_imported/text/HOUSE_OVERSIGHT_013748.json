  "text": "idealized systems, topological entropy has been proven be equivalent to the product\n\nof an index of expansion and the dimension of the support such that an increase in\nexpansiveness , 4(+), is compensated by a decrease in Do leaving hr invariant\n\n(Manning,1981). This relationship has also been found in the behavior of some\nnonuniformly expansive neuroendocrine, neuronal and human behavioral systems\n(Mandell and Selz, 1995; Smotherman et al, 1996; Mandell and Selz, 1997a;).\n\nIs Randomness Versus Determinism a Productive Question for the Biological\n\nSciences? Are There Better Ones?\n\nMeasures made on realistically nonuniformly expansive behavior of\ndynamical systems emerging from nonlinear differential equations and that arising\nfrom a variety of non-classical random walk models overlap such that making what\nmay be more a metaphysical discrimination at this point is labor intensive,\ncontentious and unproductive for generating new experimental work in the\nneurosciences. It is important to note that random walk theory and computation has\nmatured to such an extent that almost any “nonlinear dynamical behavior” can, with\nrespect to statistical measure, be modeled using one of many varieties. For\nexamples, power law distributions in continuous time random walks (times of\nmovement are also randomly chosen) , random walks with traps (temporarily\nimmobilizing the trajectory like unstable fixed points), random walks in random\nenvironments, time of passage of ants in a labyrinth and Levy leaps and local\ndiffusive exploration (looking for a wallet) among many others can represent much\nof the irregular behavior we observe in the brain (Shlesinger et al, 1982; Montroll\nand Shlesinger, 1984; Hughes, 1995; Klafter et al, 1996). On the other hand,\n(Markoff) partition of the sequence and a probabilistic style of analysis of nonlinear\ndynamical systems has been a major strategy for description and quantification\nfrom the field’s beginnings (Parry, 1964; Adler and Weiss, 1967; Bowen, 1970;\nLasota and Yorke, 1973). The issue of randomness versus determinism remains\n\ncurrent although many if not most properties of deterministic dynamical systems can\n\n248\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013748",
