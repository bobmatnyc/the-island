  "text": "Page 14 of 52\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *857\n\n[*858] Rule 1 also appears to be the best place to include the CVRA's language about a \"representative\" of a victim. This\nlanguage, too, draws from the restitution statutes. !?7\n\nRule 2 - Fairness to Victims in Construction\nThe Proposal:\nRule 2 should be amended to require fairness to victims in construing the rules as follows:\n\nThese rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in\nprocedure and fairness in administration to the government, defendants, and victims, and to eliminate unjustifiable expense and\ndelay.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe CVRA broadly mandates that victims have the right to \"be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity\nand privacy.\" !?8 This creates a substantive right to fairness, similar to that found in various state victims' rights amendments -\nincluding the [*859] amendment found in Senator Kyl's home state of Arizona. !°? This broad reading was explained by\nSenator Kyl, who, along with Senators Feinstein and Hatch, was the primary legislative sponsor of the CVRA: \"The broad\nrights articulated in this section are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of these\nrights is the right to be treated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process.\" 13°\n\nIn light of victims’ new substantive right to fairness, Rule 2 should be amended to make clear that all of the rules must be\nconstrued to be fair to victims no less than to the government and defendants.\n\n(New) Rule 10.1 - Notice of Proceedings for Victims\nThe Proposal:\nA new Rule 10.1 should be added to guarantee victims their right to notice of proceedings as follows:\n\nRule 10.1 Notice to Victims.\n\ncrime deserve to have their rights protected, whether or not they are the victim of the count charged.\" See 150 Cong. Rec. $10,910-01 (daily\ned. Oct. 9, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl). At least one court has suggested that, as a matter of discretion, it is desirable to notify even victims\nof uncharged conduct under the CVRA. See United States v. Turner, 367 F. Supp. 2d 319, 327 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (concluding that, absent\nreason to think otherwise, any person who the government asserts has been harmed by a crime or who self-identifies as such qualifies as a\n\"victim\"); cf. In re WR. Huff Asset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 561 (2d Cir. 2005) (holding that the CVRA does not grant victims any rights\nagainst individuals not convicted of a crime, but the government can attempt to obtain voluntary restitution from such persons).\n\n27 See, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3663A(a) (same definition of victim \"representative\").\n\n128 18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(8) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n\n29 See, e.g., Ariz. Const. art. II, 2(A)(1) (victim's right \"to be treated with fairness, respect, and dignity\"); see also Alaska Const. art. I, 24\n(victim's right \"to be treated with dignity, respect, and fairness during all phases of the criminal and juvenile justice process\"); Idaho Const.\nart. I, 22 (victim's right \"to be treated with fairness, respect, dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process\"); Ill. Const. art. I, 8.1\n(victims \"to be treated with fairness and respect for their dignity\"); Mich. Const. art. I, 24 (victims \"to be treated with fairness and respect for\ntheir dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process\"); N.J. Const. art. I, P 22 (victim's right to \"be treated with fairness,\ncompassion and respect by the criminal justice system\"); N.M. Const. art. II, 24 (the \"right to be treated with fairness and respect for the\nvictim's dignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process\"); Ohio Const. art. I, 10a (victims \"shall be accorded fairness, dignity,\nand respect in the criminal justice process\"); Tex. Const. art. I, 30(a)(1) (\"right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's\ndignity and privacy throughout the criminal justice process\"); Utah Const. art. I, 28(1)(a) (victim's right to be \"treated with fairness, respect,\nand dignity\"); Wis. Const. art. I, 9m (victim's right to be treated with \"fairness, dignity and respect for their privacy\"). See generally Cassell,\nsupra note 15, at 1387-88 (discussing victims' right to fairness in Utah).\n\n130 150 Cong. Rec. 4269 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017728",
