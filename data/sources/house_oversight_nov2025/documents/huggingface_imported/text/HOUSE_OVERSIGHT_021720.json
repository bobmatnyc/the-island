THOMAS —- For merchants\nat Havensight mail, it’s summer\ntime, but the living is anything but\neasy.\n\nAfter being granted six months\nof free rent by the mall’s owner, the\nGovernment Employees Retirement\nSystem, many said this has been\nthe worst off-season they -have\nexperienced.\n\nThey cited a perfect storm of\nprolonged road construction in\nfront of the mall, fewer cruise ships\ndocking in St. Thomas Harbor,\ncompetition from Crown Bay mer-\nchants and skyrocketing utility\ncosts.\n\nWhen the GERS board voted to\nrelieve.the tenants of rent obliga-\n\ntions from July 1 to Dec. 31, they.\n\ndid so because tenants had accumu-\nlated a delinquency of more than\n$2 million and reported that they\ncould no longer sustain the cost of\ndoing business. The board dis-\ncussed the closure of Dockside\nBookshop, which has announced\nthat it will close within the next\ntwo weeks after 35 years in\nbusiness.\n\nGERS. Administrator Austin\nNibbs presented the board with two\noptions: forego rent for six months\naltogether with the stipulation that\ntenants pay all arrearages by April\n1 or give tenants a 25 percent\nreduction in rent over the next 24\nmonths. The board decided the six\nmonth abatement, which would\ncost GERS a little more than $3\nmillion, would be the most feasible\n\nway to give tenants a chance to pay’\n\nthe $2 million in back rent owed.\n\n“T don’t like this rent abatement,\nbut if we want to continue to have\ntenants, we are going to have to\nhelp them,” Nibbs said.\n\nAt the meeting, some board\nmembers were under the impres-\nsion that another Havensight busi-\nness, ‘an office supply store called\nThe Draughting Shaft, was also\nscheduled to close, but, according\nto. The Draughting Shaft owner,\nTerry Robinson, that was never the\ncase. .\n\nNevertheless, Robinson said, he\nhas had discussions with GERS\nboard members and attended meet-\nings to inform them of the adverse\nconditions that had caused him to\nfall behind in his rent.\n\nRobinson said his business, unlike\nmany of the boutiques and stores that\ncater primarily to tourists, had been\nunduly hit by prolonged construc-\ntion, with orange barricades diverting\ntraffic into and out of the mall’s park-\ning lots.\n\naes\n\nNEW STORE HOURS |\n\nMiser ae\nTetstey 439\nWrberstey 159\nThentey 826\n\nFaw\nfety 405\n\n‘tenty =\na ee\n\nLb\n\ngen\n\nEffective January 4, 207 3\n\nPLEASE leave ALL\nBags\nFOOD & DaINKs\nAT THE COUNTER\nTHANK YOU\n\nDockside Bookshop in Havensight Mall is scheduled to close within the next,\ntwo weeks after 35 years in business.\n\n“Many of our customers are locals\nand residents, and many have called\nand said they just don’t want to come\nin because they don’t want to deal\nwith, it,” Robinson said of the con-\nstruction.\n\nRobinson is among a number of\nlong-time Havensight merchants who\nsay they have been in business for\ndecades but never had to weather\n\nL200 See a Ts as ‘ t\n\nDaily News File Photo\n\nanything quite like the last six\nmonths.\n\n“T remember in the 80s the slow\nseason was only three months, now\nitis a fullsix months,” Ram Mirpuri,\npresident of the Havensight\nMerchants Association said.\nMirpuri’s son, Minoj Mirpuri, owns\n\n.
