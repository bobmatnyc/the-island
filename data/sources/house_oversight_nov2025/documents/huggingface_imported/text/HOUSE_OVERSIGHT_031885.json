  "text": "10\n\nThe Gates speech effectively marks the end of the American ambition\nto turn Nato into the global, military arm of a unified western world.\nThe Americans have flirted with this idea, ever since the onset of the\n“war on terror’. But, as the Afghan war has worn on, so the military\neffort has become more and more heavily dependent on the US.\n\nThe fact that Europeans called for a campaign in Libya that they are\nincapable of conducting alone has merely re-enforced the American\nview that the European arm of Nato is, to varying degrees, feckless\nand unreliable. Disarray and recriminations within Nato hobble the\nsingle most effective potential tool for western military intervention\noverseas.\n\nEven more significant in the long run is the American anxiety that\nbudgetary constraints, which are leading to defence cuts in Europe,\nare beginning to be replicated in the US itself. Admiral Michael\nMullen, America’s top military officer, has called the budget deficit\nthe single biggest threat to US national security. It is also the single\nbiggest constraint on future bouts of “liberal interventionism”’.\nMoney is not the only problem, however. Over the past 20 years it\nhas become apparent that swiftly agreed-upon military actions can\nlead to entanglements that last for many years. There is still a Nato\nmission in Kosovo and an EU military mission in Bosnia, more than\na decade after the fighting ended in both places.\n\nAs for Afghanistan — that conflict has now lasted almost twice as long\nas the second world war. Western governments are also only\nbeginning to come to terms with what may soon be required in Libya.\nAgainst this background, there are very few takers for yet another\nmilitary venture — this time in Syria.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031885",
