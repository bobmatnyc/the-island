United States, affirmed this\nkey principle that a broad grant of\nstatutory rulemaking authority conveys\nauthority to adopt legislative rules.28\nMayo concerned in part the question of\nhow much deference a Treasury\nDepartment tax regulation should\nreceive. In Mayo, an amicus argued that\nthe Treasury Department’s\ninterpretation should receive less\ndeference because it was issued under a\ngeneral grant of rulemaking authority, as\nopposed to an interpretation issued\nunder a specific grant of authority.?9\nThe Court responded by first explaining\nits earlier holding in U.S. v. Mead, that\nChevron deference is appropriate “when\nit appears that Congress delegated\nauthority to the agency generally to\nmake rules carrying the force of law,\nand that the agency interpretation\nclaiming deference was promulgated in\nthe exercise of that authority.” 3° Then,\nin significant part, the Court observed:\n\nOur inquiry in that regard does not turn on\nwhether Congress’s delegation of authority\nwas general or specific.\n* * * * *\nThe Department issued the full-time\nemployee rule pursuant to the explicit\nauthorization to “prescribe all needful rules\nand regulations for the enforcement’ of the\nInternal Revenue Code. 26 U.S.C. 7805(a). We\nhave found such “express congressional\nauthorizations to engage in the process of\nrulemaking” to be “a very good indicator of\ndelegation meriting Chevron treatment.” 34\n\nAnd so, all nine members of the\nSupreme Court agreed on the following\nkey principle: an express, albeit general,\ngrant of rulemaking authority is fully\nsufficient for an agency to receive\nChevron deference for its rulemaking. It\nfollows that a broad grant of rulemaking\nauthority will suffice for the agency to\nengage in legislative rulemaking in the\nfirst place. Thus, the Supreme Court’s\n\n27 Statement of Donald A. Callahan, U.S. Senate\nCommittee on Education and Labor, March 29,\n1935, Legislative History of the National Labor\nRelations Act, U.S. Government Printing Office,\n1949, p. 2002.\n\n28131 S. Ct. 704, 713-14 (2011).\n\n29 Td, at 713.\n\n30 Id. (quoting United States v. Mead, 533 U.S.\n218, 226-27 (2001)); see also Chevron, 467 U.S. at\n842-43 (announcing two-part framework for\ndetermining whether courts should grant deference\nto agency interpretations of enabling statutes).\n\n31 Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 713-14 (emphasis added\nand citations omitted).\n\nrulings continue to fully support a broad\nconstruction of Section 6.\n\nDisputing this conclusion, ALG\nasserts that Section 6 was intended to be\nused “primarily”’ for procedural\nrulemaking, and cites a Senate report\nfrom the Wagner Act’s legislative\nhistory. That Senate report explains:\n“TiJn no case do the rules have the force\nof law in the sense that criminal\npenalties or fines accrue for their\nviolation, and it seems sufficient that\nthe rules prescribed must be ‘necessary\nto carry out the provisions’ of the\nact.” 32 The Board disagrees. The cited\nlanguage merely proclaims the obvious,\nthat no criminal penalties or fines\naccrue for violating the Board’s rules.\nHowever, laws such as the NLRA that\ndo not impose criminal penalties or\nfines for their violation can also have\nthe “force of law” (which is perhaps\nwhy the Senate report used the limiting\nphrase “‘in the sense of”). The Supreme\nCourt has previously recognized that\nfinal Agency orders under Sections 10\n(e) and (f) of the Act, despite their non-\nself enforcing nature, have ‘‘the force\nand effect of law.” 33 So too, do the\nBoard’s rules have the force and effect\nof law, as held by the Supreme Court in\nAHA.34\n\nSeveral comments discuss whether\nBoard Rule 103.20, which mandates the\nposting of an election notice in a\nworkplace three working days prior to a\nrepresentation election, should be\nconsidered analogous to the proposed\ntule. The United Food and Commercial\nWorkers International Union (UFCW)\ncomments that the election rule is, like\nthe proposed rule, only minimally\nburdensome and further noted that it\nhas never been challenged.25 ALG\ndisagrees that the election rule should\nbe considered analogous here, because\nalthough in the election context a notice\nposting is the most feasible means to\ninform employees about an upcoming\nelection that is occurring at a specific\n\n32 See Comparison of S. 2926 (73d Congress) and\nS. 1958 (74th Congress) 24 (Comm. Print 1935),\nreprinted in 1 Legislative History of the National\nLabor Relations Act, 1935, (1949) at 1349.\n\n33 NLRB v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 421 U.S. 132,\n153-54 (1975) (ordering disclosure of such Agency\nopinions under the FOIA, and quoting legislative\nhistory of the FOIA to that effect, H.R. Rep. No.\n1497, p. 7, U.S. Code Cong. & Admin. News, 1966,\np. 2424).\n\n34.499 U.S. at 609-10. But even if one were to\nconstrue the report in the way advocated by the\ncomment, such reports themselves do not have the\nforce and effect of law, see Lincoln v. Vigil, 508 U.S.\n182, 192 (1993); AHA, 499 U.S. at 616, and thus at\nbest are only potential evidence of legislative intent.\n\n35 However, it is incorrect that the rule has never\nbeen challenged; it has been challenged and\nupheld. See Pannier Corp. v. NLRB, 120 F.3d 603,\n606-07 (6th Cir. 1997) (rejecting an as-applied\nchallenge to Rule 103.20).\n\nplace and time, that is not the case in\nthe NLRA rights context, in which\nemployees can just search the Internet\nto find out more information. The Board\nagrees with the UFCW that posting a\nnotice is a minimally burdensome way\nto ensure that employees receive certain\ninformation, although obviously, the\nproposed notice will reach many more\nemployers over a much longer period of\ntime than do election notices. And\nALG’s acknowledgment that a notice\nposting in the workplace is in fact\nsometimes the most feasible means to\ninform employees of important\ninformation supports the Board’s belief,\nexplained below, that workplace notice\nposting is a more efficient way of\ninforming employees of their NLRA\nrights than relying on information\navailable on the Internet.\n\nA few comments argue that the Board\nis a law enforcement agency only, and\nshould not be engaging in rulemaking\nfor that reason. One comment asserts\nthat “Congress did not intend to\n“empower the NLRB to be a rulemaking\nbody, but rather an investigatory/\nenforcement agent of the NLRA.”’ 35 The\nBoard responds that by enacting Section\n6, Congress plainly and explicitly\nintended to, and did, “empower the\nNLRB to be a rulemaking body.” And,\nas shown above, AHA conclusively\nfound that the Board is empowered to\nuse its rulemaking powers, as the Court\nhad previously indicated in Wyman-\nGordon and Bell Aerospace.*”\n\nA joint comment submitted by\nDouglas Holtz-Eakin and Sam Batkins\nargues against the Board’s assertion of\nSection 6 authority here by asserting\nthat “the Supreme Court has\ncircumscribed NLRB rulemaking in the\npast: ‘The deference owed to an expert\ntribunal cannot be allowed to slip into\na judicial inertia which results in the\nunauthorized assumption by an agency\nof major policy decisions properly made\nby Congress.’ ’’ However, that comment\nneglects to provide the citation for that\nquotation, American Ship Building Co.\nv. NLRB,3® which was not a rulemaking\ncase but an adjudication. In any event,\nthe Board does not agree that this rule\npresumes to make a major policy\ndecision properly made by Congress\nalone.

Cir. 1973), the court rejected the\nargument that the FTC’s prosecutorial functions\nrendered it unsuitable for issuing rules. By way of\nexample, it noted that the NLRB is similar to the\nFTC in its methods of adjudication and\nenforcement, but the Supreme Court had repeatedly\nencouraged the Board to utilize its rulemaking\npowers.
