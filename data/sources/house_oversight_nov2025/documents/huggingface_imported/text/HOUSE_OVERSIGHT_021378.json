  "text": "Genetic studies indicate that\nheritability accounts for approximately\n50% of loneliness while social\ncircumstances account for the other 50%\n(7). Research also suggests that\nloneliness is common - reported by as\nmany as 20 percent of the population at\nany given time (8). In addition, some\nevidence suggests that the prevalence of\nloneliness may be increasing, at least in\nthe U.S. A recent national survey found\na threefold increase in the number of\nAmericans who indicated they had no\nconfidant or person with whom to\ndiscuss important matters (9). Although\ndifferences between this survey and its\n1985 predecessor may be sufficient to\naccount for this increase, this suggestive\nreport raises the possibility that\ncontemporary societal factors may be\ninterfering with the natural tendency for\nhumans to form meaningful, long-term\nsocial connections. One factor is social\nmobility, which increased dramatically\nduring the 20\" century. A second is the\naging of the U.S. population. In 1900,\n4.1% of Americans were 65 years or\nolder. By 2006, that percentage had\nincreased to 12.4%, representing 37.3\nmillion Americans (10). With less value\nplaced on older individuals in the U.S.,\nwe have witnessed an increase in\nmarginalization of this segment of\nsociety. Third, as life expectancy\nincreases, more elders are living longer\nas widows or widowers and are therefore\nat increased risk for loneliness. Other\nfactors which may place Americans at\nincreased risk for loneliness include less\nintergenerational living, delayed\nmarriage, increased dual- career\nfamilies, increased single-residence\nhouseholds, and increased age-related\ndisabilities and health conditions. Given\nthe mental and health risks associated\nwith loneliness described in Hawkley’s\n\n132\n\nPage\n\nchapter, interventions are needed to help\nlonely individuals regain normal social\nconnections. As Bunyan’s account\nsuggests, breaking through the wall of\nloneliness may require considerable\neffort. When individual effort is not\nsufficient, assistance from others may be\nneeded. Unfortunately, contemporary\ninterventions to reduce loneliness have\nfared more poorly than has been\nrecognized.\n\nRepairing Broken Connections\n\nAlmost a century ago, scholars\nbegan to propose strategies for reducing\nloneliness. Karen Rook (11), for\ninstance, amassed over 40 interventions\ndating back to the 1930’s in her attempt\nto identify effective loneliness reduction\nstrategies. Since Rook’s review, five\nscientific publications have provided\nqualitative reviews of strategies to\nreduce loneliness, social isolation, or\nboth (12-16). The most recent\npublication identified 30 interventions\npublished between 1970 and 2002 (16),\nand evaluated the effectiveness of those\nintervention studies that were not flawed\nby poor design. Among the thirteen trials\ndeemed to be of high quality, six were\nconsidered effective, one was considered\npartially effective, five were considered\nineffective, and one was inconclusive.\nThe authors’ conclusions were similar to\nthose of prior reviewers who found that\ninterventions which emphasized social\nskills training and/or group activities\nwere the most successful.\n\nHowever, qualitative reviews are\nsubject to invisible biases that can color\nour judgments of the scientific evidence\nwe see. Thomas Kuhn, a 20\" century\nphysicist and epistemologist, noted that\nscientists too easily accept results which\nconform to previous intuitions and too\nreadily reject results which do not (17).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021378",
