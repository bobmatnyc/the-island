As such, we believe the private\nsector (Zain KSA, Mobily and STC) will be key contributors to the financing of the\nexpansion plan.\n\n..intensifying the case for creation of a Saudi tower company\n\nThe Saudi telecom service providers have invested heavily in rolling out high speed\nwireless networks and, in the case of Mobily and STC, FTTH networks (not to mention\nlicense costs). This has seen the balance sheets of both Mobily and Zain KSA reaching\nrelatively high gearing levels; thereby limiting their ability to step up capital expenditure\nfor a sustained period. Consequently, we believe the focus on raising capital (to fund the\nexpansion programmes) from the spin out of their Tower portfolios will only increase.\nWe see Zain KSA as the key beneficiary of this given they have the most highly geared\nbalance sheet amongst Saudi Telco peers.\n\nMobile market share gains for Zain KSA and Mobily increasingly important\n\nWhilst the Saudi government has taken steps to introduce competition in the\ntelecommunications industry, its moves to open the market have thus fallen short of\nthis objective. Specifically, government-owned STC retains more than 60% revenue\nmarket share in Saudi Arabia, giving it a dominant position in the market, whilst Mobily\nand Zain KSA have only managed to achieve c25% and 15% revenue market share\nrespectively.\n\nThis, in our view, has likely been driven by a number of factors including: (1) the\nrelatively high cost of market entry (ie licenses) for both Mobily and Zain KSA, which has\nlumbered both with high operating costs; (2) high royalty costs, which amount to c16%\nof revenues generated in Saudi Arabia (with some exceptions, including data), arguably\ninhibiting requisite marketing and infrastructure spend. We note both Mobily and Zain\nKSA remain loss making; and, (3) the relatively high mobile termination rates, which\narguably afford an advantage to STC and prevent Zain or Mobily from competing more\naggressively on price.\n\nFor the realisation of the NTP, we believe it is important that all private sector players\nare realising sufficient rates of return and FCF generation to be able to finance the\n\nrequisite growth in infrastructure. We note both Mobily and Zain KSA were loss making\nin 2015 and are expected to return sub 5% ROE’s in both 2016 and 2017 (according to\n\nOS merrill Lynch GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 49\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016159",
