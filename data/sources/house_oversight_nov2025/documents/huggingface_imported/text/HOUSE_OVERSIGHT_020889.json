  "text": "Medicaid: Facing Accelerating Cash Flow Deficits\n\ne Social Welfare Program — Created in 1965 to provide health insurance to low-income\npopulation (2% of Americans under coverage then and 16% now’).\n\ne No Dedicated Funding — Federal funding comes from general revenue (all forms of tax\nreceipts).\n\ne Ever-Growing Expenses — $273 billion in F2010, up 2x from 10 years ago.\n\ne Rising Healthcare Costs — Owing to aging population + unhealthy life styles +\ntechnology advances.\n\ne Growing Beneficiary + Benefits — Covered beneficiaries expanded beyond low-\nincome group in 1980s to include additional groups (like individuals who have high\nmedical expenses and have spent down their assets, and some of those who lost\ntheir employer-sponsored healthcare insurance coverage in recession), while\ncovered benefits expanded to include prescription drugs / dental services. Total\nexpenditures on these new groups and benefits represented ~60% of Medicaid\nprogram’s spending in 2001, per Kaiser Family Foundation estimates. See\nslide 319-322 for more details.\n\ne Moral Hazard — As a “free good,” Medicaid reduced demand for private long-term\ninsurance’ while regulation loopholes + need-based benefit policies created\nincentives to abuse the Medicaid reimbursement system.\n\nNote: 1) for more information, please see Jeffrey Brown and Amy Finkelstein, “The Interaction of Public and Private Insurance: Medicaid and the Long-Term\n\nCare Insurance Market,” 2006. *Medicaid enrollment was 4MM (population 196MM) in 1966 and 50MM (population 305MM) in 2009.
