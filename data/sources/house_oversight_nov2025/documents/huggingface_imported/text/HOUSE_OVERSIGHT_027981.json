  "text": "Barely two months after the ambush operation in south Lebanon, Black\nSeptember seized and murdered members of the Israeli team at the 1972\nOlympics in Munich.\n\nAs soon as the news broke on the morning of September 5, I phoned Ahrahle\nYariv as head of military intelligence. “You need to send us,” I said. I tried to\npersuade him that if it came down to an operation to free our hostages, Sayeret\nMatkal offered the best hope that it would not end in a bloodbath. We had the\nmind-set, the background, the training and now the experience. I also knew the\nGerman military had no special-forces unit. ’'d have been even more worried if\nI had known that German law barred the army from operating in peacetime.\nThat meant any use of force would be left to the police. Ahrahle told me it was\ntoo early to say what involvement, if any, Israel might have. He’d get back in\ntouch with a decision when it came.\n\nI called my officers together to begin planning. I decided to use the men who\nhad been with me for the Sabena mission, including Mordechai Rachamim. We\ncollated information from the stream of media reports from Munich and\nassembled a rough idea of the layout of the building the terrorists had attacked.\nAs for the attackers, I said we had to assume there were at least half-a-dozen,\nthat they had not just AK-47s but grenades or other explosives. And that like the\nSabena hijackers, they would be prepared to die but hoping to live. All of that\nturned out to be true. None of it, however, could alter the reply I got from\nAhrahle a couple of hours later. “We decided to send Zvika,” he said. Zvika\nZamir was the head of Mossad, and he would be going only as an observer. Any\noperation against the terrorists would still be in the hands of German units.\n\nThe German police’s bungled attempt to end the ordeal was especially\npainful because it was so predictable. I believe that if we had been there, at least\nsome of the eleven Israelis killed might not have lost their lives. The Germans\nlaunched an ambush at a NATO airfield outside Munich, when the terrorists and\nhostages were ostensibly on their way to board a flight for Cairo. We know now\nthat there was no properly co-ordinated plan. Too few police were deployed for\nthe operation. They were insufficiently armed, and they lacked relevant training\nor experience. The result: a bloodbath. As a final insult to the memory of the\nmurdered Israelis, although the three surviving terrorists were jailed, the\n\n133\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027981",
