Halperin’ Ada Clapp\nJoe Avantario\nJeffrey-given the high daily interest cost (50k+/-) on $$ borrowed which you pointed out yesterday, here's what\nI'm thinking, but I want to be 100% on the same page as you:\n\n1. Close next monday on the credit line, but don't borrow any $$. (We can, of course push closing back but my\npreference wld be to close.)\n\n2. Right now, at barry's request, Irene Steiner, on behalf of the trustees is reviewing apol and apo-ol. While\nprobably not impt on a \"substantive\" basis it was (a) impt to barry and (b) is likely good for leon.\n\n3. We are hoping to have signature pages to the trustees (and returned to us) by early to mid next week. (Ada\nwill oversee.)\n\n4. We will then get the new trust to bofa who, moving quickly (according to them), will have an acct open the\nfollowing week, 12/7-9.\n\n5. We need to manage execution of paperwork associated with decanting which I assume occurs once apo-ol\nand bank acct are operative. (Ada I'm sure you'll be on top of this).\n\n6. assume we will move $$ to pay down loan the day or day after (?) apo-01 bank acct open. As you know we\ncld do this as early as next monday/tuesday but then cash will be sitting in apo-1 while we're waiting for apo-01\nbank acct.\n\n7. If there are sales of assets (or Ilc's) from leon to apol or apo-01 that needs to be buttoned down and\norganized asap.\n\n8. Same if you want another NEW trust in the mix as that will involve paperwork and opening an acct with\nbank.\n\nLet's discuss to make sure we're on the same page on process.

(alan ) pent. ( with\nfollow up ) all part of same elegant transaction, 6 asymetric risk worth at least 50- 60 no matter how you\ncalculate.
