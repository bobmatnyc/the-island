  "text": "; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin, : im glad\nthat you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense , in fact I take comfort in the fact that after\nonly one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more.\n\nI expect as a friend you will understand that\n\nI will no longer , not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long\noverdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul\nweiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin, , no one. needs toend.. you and I had\npreviously agreed no more of that , and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can\nnot say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you\nwont want to pay , so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge\n\nIf I can find the time to work , on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I hope\nyou understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as\nto avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with\nyou , I find it very distasteful. . soto be clear , my terms are as follows. I will only work for the usual 40\nmillion per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement . 5 million every 2 months\nthereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin ifiam able in January. I will immediately stop\nwork , if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15, it will be 10\nmillion. paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with\nprofessionals overseen by Barry. (hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any\npainting you could possible own. _. no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the\nhour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say.\n\n10n Apr 6, 2018, at 11:15 AM, Jeskewitz, J carminc inn wrote:\n\nI’m in touch with Lesley and I, we will work together on these reservations.\nAll my best,'sep'Jeannine\n\nOn Tue, Apr 3, 2018 at 5:43 PM, Lisa Emelia Svensson iit: wrote:\n\nAir France has a strejk ... so French\nTrying to rebook later in the week Will let you know\n\n3 apr. 2018 kl. 16:29 skrev jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>:\nim in paris now\n\nDate: Tue, Nov 15, 2016 at 6:13 AM\nSubject: Fwd:\n\nLeon, Congragulations on biting the bullet. at least 18 months late , but Im encouraged and glad for\nyou. When you interviewed Brad two years ago you asked that i not tell him what a disaster lay before\nhim. what would you like me to tell Barry?\n\nThere is a HUGE amount of work to be done in the next 9 -12 months. mostly the exact same work that i\noutlined in my email of 2 years ago. now complicated by years of mess on top. ( you can send it again if you\nlike ). Brad wechsler was never up to the task . sorry, I realize I have been saying the very same thing for a\nlong time. he was a not a step up from Eileen but a step sideways. in the beginning there was Eileen and\nTom and Ralph Lerner. all your hand picks. then brad. john, Joe. . joslin was chosen from a pool of 2\npeople. each that would be limited by a salary of 250k. ( yes 1 personally augmented his comp in order to get\nhim ) I did say hire both Lisa to do the bookkeeping and joslin tax, | He complained for over a year , re his\ndirection by eileen and ada , and then brad. His breakdown was not a surprise after months and moths of\nwarnings. Though disabled, he ran your office this year. with john and joe. He ran amok, and as i told\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023323",
