  "text": "80 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\n\nvastly overstates its position when it asserts that “most courts ... have\ndeclined to extend enforceable nghts under the CVRA to alleged victims of\nconduct that did not lead to criminal proceedings.”'' All the courts that\nhave actually reached the issue have concluded exactly the opposite.''®\n\nB. OLC’S DISTORTION OF THE CVRA’S STRUCTURE AND LEGISLATIVE\nHISTORY\n\nThe next section of OLC’s memorandum maintains that the CVRA’s\nstructure and legislative history lead to the conclusion that the CVRA is\n“best understood” as extending rights after charges have been filed. Here\nagain, OLC’s analysis is truncated at best and misleading at worst.\n\nOLC begins this part of its analysis by observing that some of the\nrights in the CVRA are limited to court proceedings. OLC notes, for\nexample, that the CVRA gives victims the “right to reasonable, accurate,\nand timely notice of any public court proceeding ... involving the\ncrime.”''’ But the fact that some of the rights listed in the CVRA apply to\ncourt proceedings hardly means that all of the rights are to be so restricted.\nThe federal criminal justice process includes stages that are pre-charging,\npost-charging, and post-conviction. It would hardly be surprising to find\nthat a statute that Congress intended to be “broad and encompassing”™!!®\ncovered events occurring after the filing of charges.\n\nIndeed, OLC appears to recognize that at least three of the rights listed\nin the CVRA could easily apply before charges are filed: (1) the “right to be\nreasonably protected from the accused”; (2) the “reasonable right to confer\nwith the attorney for the Government in the case”; and (3) the “right to be\ntreated with faimess and with respect for the victim’s dignity and\nprivacy.”!!° None of these rights explicitly refer to court “proceedings” or\nother events (such as parole hearings) that necessarily occur after the filing\nof formal charges.'”°\n\n15 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5-6. Notably, the Department does not\nembrace the language from Huff found within the Skinner and Paletz decisions because\npresumably such an approach would be contrary to many of the rights found in the CVRA.\n\n16 See infra Part I.C.\n\n'T OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6 (emphasis added) (quoting 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3771(a)(2)).\n\n18 150 Conc. REc. 7295 (2004) (statement of Sen. Dianne Feinstein).\n\n19 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 7-8, 10 (quoting 18 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(1),\n(5), (8)).\n\n°° OLC appears to have overlooked another right that could well apply before charges\nare filed: the right to be notified of one’s rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C.\n§ 3771(c)(1) (requiring prosecutors to “make their best efforts to see that crime victims are\nnotified of, and accorded, the rights described in [the CVRA]”); United States v. Rubin, 558\nF. Supp. 2d 411, 428 (E.D.N.Y. 2008) (discussing potential application of the right to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014059",
