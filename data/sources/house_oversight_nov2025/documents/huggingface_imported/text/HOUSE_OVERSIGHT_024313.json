Our certificate of incorporation\nprovides that the authorized number of directors may be changed only by resolution of our Board. Our certificate also provides that our Board will be\ndivided into three classes of directors, with the classes as nearly equal in number as possible. At each annual meeting of stockholders, a class of directors\nwill be elected for a three-year term to succeed the class whose term is then expiring.\n\nThe following table sets forth the director class, name, age as of April 23, 2019, and other information for each member of our board of\n\ndirectors:\n\nEXPIRATION\n\nCURRENT OF TERM\nDIRECTOR TERM FOR WHICH\n\nNAME CLASS AGE POSITION SINCE EXPIRES NOMINATED\nGregory Sullivan II 60 Director 2017 2019 2022\nDan Quayle II 72 Director 2017 2019 2022\nMichael Maroone Ill 65 Lead Director 2017 2020\nErnest Garcia III I 36 President, CEO and Chairman 2017 2021\nIra Platt I 55 Director 2017 2021\n\nWe believe that in order for our Board to effectively guide us to long-term sustainable, dependable performance, it should be composed of\nindividuals with sophistication and experience in the many disciplines that impact our business. To best serve our stockholders, we seek to have a board\nthat, as a whole, is competent in key corporate disciplines, including accounting and financial acumen, business judgment, crisis management, governance,\nleadership, people management, risk management, social responsibility and reputational issues, and strategy and strategic planning. Additionally, the Board\ndesires to have specific knowledge related to our industry, such as expertise in automotive retail and consumer finance.\n\nThe Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that all directors must, at a minimum, meet the criteria set forth in the Board’s code of\nconduct and the corporate governance guidelines, which specify, among other things, that the Compensation and Nominating Committee will consider\ncriteria such as independence, diversity, age, skills, and experience in the context of the needs of the Board. In addressing issues of diversity in particular,\nthe Compensation and Nominating Committee considers a nominee’s differences in viewpoint, professional experience, background, education, skill, age,\nrace, gender, and national origin. The Compensation and Nominating Committee believes that diversity of backgrounds and viewpoints is a key attribute for\na director nominee. Accordingly, to improve director diversity and best serve our stockholders, the Compensation and Nominating Committee adopted a\npolicy in 2019 to request that any search firm that it engages include women and minority candidates in the initial list from which the committee selects\ndirector candidates. The Compensation and Nominating Committee also will consider a combination of factors for each director, including whether the\nnominee possesses:\n\n-5-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024313",
