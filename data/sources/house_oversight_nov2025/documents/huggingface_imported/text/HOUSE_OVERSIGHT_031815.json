  "text": "I understand your frustrations and appreciate your willingness to figure out a solution. I have some ideas\nwhich I will send you over the weekend if that is OK.\n\nRe Broadcom: _ the stock is up $1.20 at $211.50. After the initial shock reaction of yesterday, there has been\na lot of focus on the cost synergies etc. but very little conviction in revenue opportunities. However until we\nhear from management as to the overall intentions of the deal, uncertainty will linger.\n\nThis morning the pricing is as follows:\n\nAug 200 Puts cost $4.10\nSept 200 Puts cost $7.90\n\nEarning are on 08/30. So worst case is the uncertainty lingers until then which would argue to buy the Sept\nputs. However I still prefer buying the Aug puts as I would fully expect more clarity from management\nbefore August expiry.\n\nPaul\n\nPaul Barrett\nAlpha Group Capital LLC\n142 W 57\" Street, 11\" Floor, New York, NY 10019\n\n<image003.jpg>\n\nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>\nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 7:11 AM\n\nTo: Paul Barrett <>; Richard Kah (a\n\nSubject:\n\nIm not angry, sorry, itis sad. it is apparent that you have no experience trading. we both made a\nmistake. . the spy trades were the results of arank amatuer.. youtook a postion on the direction of the\nmarket. ok. you decided to play it extra short time and short. . why? becaue the options are cheaper.\n? knowing full well that time premium was running. . first silly move. .
