  "text": "21\n\non the verge of producing a nuclear weapon or acquiring the\n“breakout capacity” to make one, but never, despite the dire warning\nof Israeli leaders dating back to the 1990s, doing either, preferring to\ndwell in the Islamic Republic’s favored zones: ambivalence and\ninertia. As one awaits this tortuous Godot, one might recall a forecast\nof a bomb by 1999 (Shimon Peres) or 2004 (Ehud Barak), or Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu’s talk of “a messianic apocalyptic cult\ncontrolling atomic bombs,” or my friend Jeffrey Goldberg’s allusion\nin The Atlantic last year to a “consensus” that there is “a better than\n50 percent chance that Israel will launch a strike by next July.” That\nwould be next month.\n\nIt might also be worth recalling that Meir Dagan, the former head of\nIsrael’s Mossad spy agency, declared last month that attacking Iran\nwould be “a stupid idea.” He suggested his main worry was not Iran\nitself but Netanyahu’s susceptibility to “dangerous adventure.”\nDagan’s concerns have surfaced as Seymour Hersh concludes in a\nNew Yorker article this month that, as he put it in one interview,\n“There’s just no serious evidence inside that Iran is actually doing\nanything to make a nuclear weapon.”\n\nHis reporting reveals that the U.S. National Intelligence Estimate\n(N.I.E.) of 2007 — which concluded “with high confidence” that Iran\nhad halted a nuclear-weapons program in 2003 — still pertains in the\nclassified N.I.E. of 2011. As a retired senior intelligence official put\nit to Hersh, there’s nothing “substantially new” that “leads to a\nbomb.”\n\nIn other words, Iran, epicenter of inefficiency, unable to produce a\nkilowatt of electricity through its Bushehr nuclear reactor despite\ndecades of effort, is still doing its old brinkmanship number.\nRemember, Ali Khamenei, the supreme leader, is the guardian of the\nrevolution. That is a conservative business. Breakout, let alone a\nbomb, is a bridge too far if the Islamic Republic is what you’ve\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031896",
