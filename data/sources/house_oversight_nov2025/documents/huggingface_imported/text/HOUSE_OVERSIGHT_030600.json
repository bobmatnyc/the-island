You have friends saying they don't believe you would act in this way and you need to say that you\ndid not.\n\nThe Mail website is read by 193 million | don't see how a statement denying the allegations will make matters\nworse which is the acid test. It will make your position better as you will astrong open denial on record. These\nallegations must not gain traction.\n\n| wont say anymore as | have given my advice - call me.\n\nBest\n\nPhilip\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 2900787/Prince- Andrew- Heidi-Klum-Hookers-Pimps-party-New-\nYork-socialite-accused-procuring- underage-girls-billionaire- pedophile-Jeffrey-Epstein.html\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030600",
