  "text": "Invisible Forces\n\nFarr Curlin meditates on the\npuzzle of medicine—what is its\nevolutionary and social function, what\ndraws individual practitioners to it, and\nwhat grounds its fundamental values.\n\nThe values of scientific inquiry lead to\ntreating the objects of inquiries in just\nthat way: as objects. But objectifying\npatients and their disease would seem to\nwork against the human values of\nempathy and caring for the weak that\nalso seems to be part and parcel of what\nmedicine is as a practice. Curlin argues\nthat religious values inform and nurture\nthe human side by insisting that there\nmust be a connection between physician\nand patient, acting as an often\nunrecognized invisible force that\nhumanizes the practice of medicine.\n\nReligion is neither necessary nor\nsufficient for an individual to adhere to\nsuch values. The question of what it is\nthat grounds the fundamental values that\ngovern our relationships, and how those\nvalues are reflected in invisible social,\npsychological, and biological forces, is\ncentral to the work of our network. Ina\nconcluding essay, Ronald Thisted\nreflects on the many threads of\ninvestigation and discussion that have\nmade up our conversation, and how they\nare interwoven into a network of inquiry\nthat sheds light on invisible forces and\nthe social brain.\n\nPa\n\nat\nQ\n\n6 | 146\n\n¢\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021392",
