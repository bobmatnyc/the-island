Although I can see the red underlining Microsoft\nWord kindly inserts so liberally into my text, I can’t easily see the occasions\nwhen I use ahomonym. A fine poem illustrating the problem was kindly\nwritten by Jerrold H. Zar and published in The Journal of Irreproducible\nResults. It hangs on the wall behind my computer to remind me to check\nfor these errors.\n\nCandidate for a Pullet Surprise\nBy Jerrold H.
