  "text": "Creativity 305\n\nIf you tried, you and your neighbor would probably find the results\nrather humorous. But, most likely, you did not follow my instruction.\nThis is a form of social self-censorship. I asked you to do something rather\ndifficult and embarrassing, but very creative and likely to enlighten you.\nSadly most people — I am no exception — tend to censor their creativity\nfor fear of embarrassment. Children, of course, do not sensor themselves\nas much as adults.\n\nNow you know how to be more creative. Find your inner child and\ndon't censor yourself too much!\n\nWhat Sparks Creativity\n\nAs an inventor, I’m often asked what makes me creative. How do I do it?\nThe answer is, I have no real process. After all, a process is mechanical\nand this entire book has been about exploring how creativity is a non-\nmechanical task. However, there are many things you can do to unleash\nyour creative potential.\n\nNew ideas are often sparked through linking disparate ideas. Expose\nyourself to as many ideas as you can, read widely, attend conferences,\nvisit customers.\n\nCreativity requires peace and quiet. I personally get up early every\nmorning. This gives me a good two hours of uninterrupted time every\nday. It’s also the part of the day when my brain works best. Others prefer\nto work late into the night.\n\nPressure, for me and for many people, is a great incentive. Tales of\nthe Polish Enigma code breakers, Douglas Adams’ writing deadlines and\nthe fear of impending death in shark attack stories all force people to\nthink in an accelerated way. This appears to help many people defeat the\nhuman tendency to prevaricate.\n\nOn the other hand avoid panic. While a level of pressure can help,\npanic is unproductive. There is a sweet spot between having enough time\nto get properly acquainted with a problem and an impending deadline\nto force the crystallization of ideas. This balance varies from person to\nperson and is something you need to test for yourself.\n\nYou need time off. Once you have a well thought out idea, you\nmay need to leave it alone for a while to allow your subconscious to\nwork. Time off does not need to be two weeks at the beach. Charles\nDarwin and Benjamin Britten used to go for long walks. You can walk in\nDarwin's footsteps at Down House in Kent. Others such as John Cleese\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015995",
