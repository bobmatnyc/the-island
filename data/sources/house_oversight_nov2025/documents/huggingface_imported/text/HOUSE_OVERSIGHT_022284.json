  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54013\n\nBut even if the new rule is understood\nto compel employer speech, Section 8(c)\n‘““merely implements the First\nAmendment.” Brown, 554 U.S. at 67\n(quoting NLEB v. Gissel Packing Co.,\n395 U.S. 575, 617 (1969)). Thus, if a\nFirst Amendment challenge to the rule\nmust fail, so too must a challenge based\non Section 8(c). Such was the holding\nof the D.C. Circuit in UAW v. Chao.\nThere, the court was presented with a\npreemption argument, grounded in\nSection 8(c), challenging a Federal\nprocurement regulation that required\ncontractors to post a notice informing\ntheir employees of certain NLRA rights.\nThe D.C. Circuit interpreted Section 8(c)\nas coextensive with the scope of free\nspeech rights protected by the First\nAmendment and upheld the\nprocurement regulation in light of well-\nestablished free speech jurisprudence in\nthe labor context. See 325 F.3d at 365.\n\n3. Lack of Contemporaneity With the\nEnactment of the NLRA\n\nSeveral comments attack the notice-\nposting regulation for its lack of\ncontemporaneity with the enactment of\nthe NLRA. For example, many\ncomments criticize the regulation by\nnoting that ‘‘this is a new rule\ninterpreted into the Act 75 years after its\npassage.”’ The Board rejects these\ncontentions for two reasons.\n\nFirst, the Supreme Court has\nrepeatedly “‘instructed that ‘neither\nantiquity nor contemporaneity with [a]\nstatute is a condition of [a regulation’s]\nvalidity.”’ Mayo, 131 S. Ct. at 712\n(alterations in original) (quoting Smiley\nv. Citibank (S.D.), N.A., 517 U.S. 735,\n740 (1996)); see also Smiley, 517 U.S. at\n740 (deferring to a regulation “issued\nmore than 100 years after the\nenactment” of the statutory provision\nthat the regulation construed). Second,\nthe argument fails to consider that much\nhas changed since 1935, the year the\nNLRA was enacted. Unionization rates\nare one example. As pointed out in the\nNPRM and as confirmed by comments\nsubmitted by the Association of\nCorporate Counsel’s Employment and\nLabor Law Committee, unionization\nrates increased during the early years of\nthe Act, peaking at around 35 percent of\nthe workforce in the mid-1950s. But\nsince then, the share of the workforce\nrepresented by labor unions has\n\nPilchak attorneys to revise the rule to specify that\nemployers ‘‘may post a notice of equal dignity\nwhich advises employees of * * * additional rights\nand realities.” Alternatively, the Pilchak attorneys\npropose that the Board amend the rule to permit\nemployers to “alter the Poster and include\nadditional rights.” Adopting this suggestion would\ncompromise the integrity of the notice as a\ncommunication from the government. It, too, is\ntherefore rejected.\n\nplummeted to approximately 8 percent.\nAs a result, fewer employees today have\ndirect, everyday access to an important\nsource of information regarding NLRA\nrights and the Board’s ability to enforce\nthose rights.\n\nAs noted above, “[tlhe responsibility\nto adapt the Act to changing patterns of\nindustrial life is entrusted to the Board.”’\nJ. Weingarten, Inc., 420 U.S. at 266. It\nwould therefore be an abdication of that\nresponsibility for the Board to decline to\nadopt this rule simply because of its\nrecent vintage. Accordingly, the Board\nfinds such arguments unpersuasive.\n\n4, Comparison With Other Statutes That\nContain Notice-Posting Requirements\n\nMany comments note, as the Board\ndid in the NPRM, that several other\nlabor and employment statutes enacted\nby Congress contain express notice-\nposting provisions. See 75 FR 80411\n(listing such statutes). Though a few\nsuch comments, such as those of the\nInternational Brotherhood of Teamsters,\napplaud the Board for “‘fill[ing] this\nglaring and indefensible gap,” the bulk\nof these comments instead argue that\nthe lack of a parallel statutory provision\nin the NLRA negates the existence of\nBoard authority to issue this rule.\n\nThe Board notes that inferences\ngleaned from side-by-side comparisons\nto other statutes have diminished force\nwhen an agency uses its gap-filling\nauthority under Chevron. There are\nmany possible reasons why Congress\ndid not include an express notice-\nposting provision in the NLRA.\n“Perhaps that body consciously desired\nthe [agency] to strike the balance at this\nlevel * * *; perhaps it simply did not\nconsider the question at this level; and\nperhaps Congress was unable to forge a\ncoalition on either side of the question\n* * * ” Chevron, 467 U.S. at 865. But,\n“(flor judicial purposes, it matters not\nwhich of these things occurred.” Id.\nIndeed, the central premise behind\nChevron and its progeny is that agencies\nshould be allowed reasonable latitude to\nfill gaps arising from congressional\nsilence or ambiguity. Accordingly, “the\ncontrast between Congress’s mandate in\none context with its silence in another\nsuggests not a prohibition but simply a\ndecision not to mandate any solution in\nthe second context, i.e., to leave the\nquestion to agency discretion.’’ Cheney\nR.R. Co. v. ICC, 902 F.2d 66, 69 (D.C.\nCir. 1990) (labeling the expressio unius\nest exclusio alterius canon “an\nespecially feeble helper’ in Chevron\ncases).\n\nArguments contrasting the NLRA with\nother federal enactments that contain\nnotice-posting requirements might have\nsome persuasive force if there were\n\nevidence that Congress had considered\nand rejected inserting such a\nrequirement into the Act. However,\nnothing in the legislative history of the\nAct so indicates. Indeed, there is not the\nslightest hint that the omission of a\nnotice-posting requirement was the\nproduct of legislative compromise and\ntherefore implies congressional rejection\nof the idea. Cf. Ind. Prot. & Advocacy\nServs. v. Ind. Family & Soc. Servs.\nAdmin., 603 F.3d 365, 384-85 (7th Cir.\n2010) (en banc) (Posner, J., concurring)\n(inferring a private right of action from\nstatutory silence in a case where such\nsilence was not the product of\n“legislative compromise’’). For these\nreasons, the Board rejects the Motor and\nEquipment Manufacturers Association’s\nunsupported suggestion that there has\nbeen an affirmative “legislative\ndetermination not to include a posting\nrequirement by employers that have not\nviolated the Act.”\n\nA number of comments point out that\nCongress included a general notice-\nposting provision in the Railway Labor\nAct (RLA), which predates the NLRA.\nGiven the relative proximity of these\ntwo enactments, some comments regard\nthe absence of a notice-posting\nprovision in the NLRA as strong\nevidence that Congress did not intend\nfor there to be one. For reasons just\nexplained, the Board does not find a\nside-by-side comparison with the RLA\navailing. In addition, the Board notes\nthat although the NLRA and the RLA\nshare several common features, the\nNLRA was not perfectly modeled after\nthe RLA. See Bhd. of R.R. Trainmen v.\nChi. River & Ind. R.R. Co., 353 U.S. 30,\n31 n.2 (1957) (“The relationship of labor\nand management in the railroad\nindustry has developed on a pattern\ndifferent from other industries. The\nfundamental premises and principles of\nthe Railway Labor Act are not the same\nas those which form the basis of the\nNational Labor Relations Act * * *.”’).\n\nFinally, the Board notes that other\nfederal departments and agencies have\nnot understood Congress’s failure to\ninclude an express provision containing\na notice-posting requirement in a federal\nlabor or employment statute as a bar to\nsuch a regulatory requirement. Like the\nNLRA, the Fair Labor Standards Act\n(FLSA), which was passed in 1938, does\nnot contain a provision requiring\nemployers to post a notice of pertinent\nemployee rights. Yet the Department of\nLabor adopted a notice requirement now\ncodified at 29 CFR 516.4. Furthermore,\nthe Board is unaware of any challenge\nto the Labor Department’s authority to\npromulgate or enforce the FLSA notice\nrequirement, which has been in effect\nfor over 60 years.
