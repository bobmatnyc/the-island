  "text": "District Attorney. Mr. Weinberg told me that he was unable to take a position on the Post’s\nmotion without first reviewing it and reserved the right to file an opposition, if necessary.\n\n11. | On December 21, 2018, the Post filed a motion requesting an order unsealing the\nappellate briefs and directing the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office to produce copies with\nthe names of victims redacted (the “December 21 Motion”).\n\n12. On or about December 28, 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney’s Office filed an\naffirmation in response to the Post’s motion, signed by Assistant District Attorney Karen\nFriedman Agnifilo and dated December 28, 2018 (the “DA Affirmation”). A true and correct\ncopy of the Affirmation is annexed hereto as Exhibit E.\n\n13. On January 2, 2019, I spoke with Ms. Friedman Agnifilo to discuss the DA\nAffirmation. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo told me that there had been a miscommunication by Mr.\nFrost and that the District Attorney’s Office did oppose the December 21 Motion. Ms. Friedman\nAgnifilo also told me that, in the view of the District Attorney’s Office, the Post should give\nnotice of their motion to unseal the appeal briefs to the prosecutors in Florida that handled the\nprosecution that led to Mr. Epstein’s conviction for solicitation of prostitution from a minor. The\nPost disagrees with that position but nevertheless decided to moot any procedural issues related\nto requirements to notify the Florida prosecutors. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo subsequently informed\nme that the agency in Florida responsible for Mr. Epstein’s prosecution was the Palm Beach\nCounty State Attorney’s Office.\n\n14. On January 3, 2019, I received an email from Mr. Weinberg stating that “after\nconsideration of your request for the unsealing of the appellate briefs with redactions of certain\nidentities, we take no position on behalf of Mr. Epstein.” A true and correct copy of that email is\n\nannexed hereto as Exhibit F.\n\n4840-5788-8644v. 1 3930033-000039\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016426",
