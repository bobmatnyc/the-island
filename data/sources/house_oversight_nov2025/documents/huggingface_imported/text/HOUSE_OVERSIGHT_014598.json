Losses from\nthese long-duration positions in response to higher\nrates could beget more bond sales, creating a\nvicious cycle. That yields are still extremely low\nby historical standards does little to assuage these\nfears. Consider that 10-year government bond\nyields in all G-7 countries have been higher at least\n90% of the time since 1958. Given all the above,\n\nFor now, we remain tactically\npositioned to benefit from further\n\nrenminbi weakness given our long-\n\nstanding concerns about China’s\neconomic vulnerabilities and the\nlikelihood of looser policy, policy\nmistakes and capital outflows.\n\nwe believe the ascent of interest rates remains in\nits infancy.\n\nStill, it is important to differentiate between\na normalization of interest rates and a disorderly\nbackup. While we expect higher interest rates over\nthe coming years, secular headwinds—like aging\ndemographics and slower productivity growth—\nsuggest the terminal point of that increase will be\nlower than the historical average. This fact is not\nlost on the Federal Reserve, which has reduced\nits estimate of the long-run equilibrium nominal\nrate—the rate consistent with full employment and\nstable inflation in the medium term—from 4.25%\nto 3% over recent years.\n\nWith a lower interest rate target\nto reach, the Federal Reserve is likely\nto proceed slowly, particularly given\nuncertainty around its estimate of the\neconomy’s equilibrium rate and lingering\ninternational risks. Even if the Federal\nReserve were to raise rates three times in\n2017, that pace would still be less than\nhalf of the historical median tightening\npace.** Thus far in this cycle, the\nFederal Reserve has raised rates only\nonce per year.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, we recommend\ninvestors favor credit over duration risk\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 65\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014598",
