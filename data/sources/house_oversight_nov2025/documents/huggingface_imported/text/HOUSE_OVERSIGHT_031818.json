Nothing has\nchanged regarding their core business. Data center spending is not going to change based off this M&A transaction.\nHowever if | am wrong and the market further penalizes the stock at least our losses are contained. The stock has\ndropped $40 and | think we could easily recoup our premium if the market buys into the CEO’s reason for the merger.\n\nIf | never had a position | would absolutely buy the stock using options. | would be selling October $185 puts and buying\nOct $220 calls costing 50c/share.\n\nPaul\n\nPaul Barrett\nAlpha Group Capital LLC\n142 W 57\" Street, 11° Floor, New York, NY 10019\n\nCX | Br cae\nCAPITAL\n\nFrom: jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com>\nSent: Friday, July 13, 2018 2:18 PM\nTo: Paul Barrett\n\nSubject: Re: AVGO\n\nAgain?? How many puts ? What are the alternatives. The fact tgat you iwn thd stock at a higher price is affecting your\ndecision. Sorry. This is judt ridiculous!!! Would you buy the stock here . ???? If you would would you also buy puts\n??? My patience is at its end\n\nOn Fri, Jul 13, 2018 at 2:13 PM Paul Barrett i wrote:\n\nMy initial recommendation this morning was to buy the $200 Aug puts. | still think that is the best idea. The stock is\nnow down 16% on a deal that no one fully understands. The CEO has a good track record regarding mergers. So | think\nit makes sense to keep the stock and own protection for the next 35 days until we hopefully get more clarity from\nmanagement.\n\nPaul Barrett\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031818",
