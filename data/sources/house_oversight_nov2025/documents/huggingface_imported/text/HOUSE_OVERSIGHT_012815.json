  "text": "schadenfreude, as well as in studies that I will explore in a few sections, witnesses learn of a misfortune\nthat happens to another but this news has no direct bearing on the witness. In Carlsmith’s experiments, the\nwitnesses learn of a misfortune, but the offender’s defection has a direct bearing on the witness in terms\nof money lost. Thus, although punishment may feel good, the benefit may not make up for the lost\nincome.\n\nEveryone in Carlsmith’s experiments also believed that punishment would cause people to think\nless about the offender. They were wrong again. Punishers, but not those who simply witnessed\npunishment, ruminated more about the selfish offenders. Rumination led to more bad feelings. These bad\nfeelings led to more rumination, giving birth to a vicious cycle of feeling bad and ruminating about those\nwho cheated them of some money. Rumination heightened the comparative difference in resources.\n\nCarlsmith’s findings are paradoxical and disturbing. Paradoxically, they suggest that in some\nsituations, our expectations about the feeling of punishing an immoral act are inverted from the feelings\nwe feel following punishment: rather than feeling a happy high, we feel a depressing low, often\naccompanied by increasing anger. In the context of punishing a free-rider who stiffed the group, everyone\nexpects to feel a tingle of delicious delight, but many end up feeling angry instead. The entire polarity of\nthe emotion has switched, with rumination and anger dominating our thoughts. This is a dangerous state\nto enter. Faced with the strong belief and desire that revenge should feel good, but lacking any\nconfirmation, we are moved to find new evidence. With anger at the helm, there is only one solution:\nescalate the level of punishment, and continue to do so until it feels good. This is precisely the pattern I\ndescribed above for obesity: the wanting system continues to search for liking and reward, but fails, and\nthus continues. Whether it is an unsatisfied desire for food or revenge, the unfortunate consequence is an\nescalation to excess. Evil isn’t far behind, fueled by a variety of situations in which we fail to obtain what\n\nwe want.\n\nThe great leveler\n\nWe are often envious of those who have what we desire, whether it is good looks, money, a warm\nsupportive family, or a better tennis stroke. Envy can motivate us to change our looks, find careers that\nwill improve our finances, seek relationships that will provide additional support, and pick up a few extra\ntennis lessons to win the next match. Unfortunately, envy can quickly turn, as desire and a deep sense of\ninferiority transform into insatiable cravings to acquire whatever is necessary to gain superiority. Envy\nthus wears two masks, one benign and inspirational, the other malignant and destructive. As the writer\n\nDorothy Sayers noted, envy “is the great leveler; if it cannot level things up, it will level them down.”\n\nHauser Chapter 2. Runaway desire 69\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012815",
