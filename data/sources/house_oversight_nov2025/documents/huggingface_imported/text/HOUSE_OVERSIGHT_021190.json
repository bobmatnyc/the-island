  "text": "achievement, like taking a piece of that serenity and putting on paper for\nme to keep in my heart where it still is today, closing my eyes Iam able\nto see it, being there anytime I need to. I was enjoying the heat and taking\nin the deserts sights when I stumbled off the track and into the\nwildemess. Exploring everything new to me was my second nature and\nnever even entered my mind what would’ve happened if I went too far or\ngot lost. | would rather face Mother Nature’s wrath than humankind’s any\nday!\n\nAfter about an hour of drifting off track I came to a pile of rubble,\nlooking like the remnants of an old pueblo made out of clay and rock. I\npicked up what looked like half of a clay bowl and noted that it had\nIndian designs etched into the side of it. Excited about my findings I\ndecided to do some more exploring around the fields surrounding the\nhistoric site. I collected rare pieces of arrowheads, utensils, and parts of\nmany broken bowls with artwork telling tales of their own. Time was of\nno essence here and before I even realized the sun had sunk deeper into\nthe hills leaving me without any light to find my way back to the\npathway. Feeling silly now after passing by a familiar looking boulder\ntwice over, I was startled when I heard some poor animal become dinner\nfor another, it’s screams of agony only amplified louder and echoed in\nmy ear drums, heightening the hairs on the back of my neck and making\nmy heart beat nearly out of my chest.\n\nI was lost and confused before but now I was petrified with fear.\nTaking me over three hours to find my way back to the path and in the\ndirection of Jeffrey’s mansion was a mission, so relieved in the end and\nso were the housemaids after I hadn’t showed up for dinner, assuming I\nmust’ve been out for one of my usual adventures. I went to bed\nstrenuously exhausted that night and as I was falling asleep the phone\nrang, it was a call from Jeffrey who had been alerted of my\ndisappearance. “What happened tonight, one of the maids called me to\ntell me you hadn’t come back from your walk this evening” Detecting a\ntone of anger in his voice I tried to distract him by telling him of my\nfindings and he scolded me for being gone for so long without anyone\nknowing where I was. Going back to the Indian remnants, I persisted on\ntelling him what T had found. In the end he was just worried about me\nbecoming a liability, but had to make it sound as if he cared. ‘‘ Don’t\nworry Jeffrey, I won’t be doing that again. I can honestly say I have\nlearned my lesson and the next time I want to explore | promise to take\nsomeone with me”. J satisfied his worry of me being a future nuisance\nand with that I was finally able to tell him what I had discovered on my\nwalk. He was impressed but did not sound surprised. “You must’ve been\ngone a long time if you found the old Indian pueblo’s, just be careful you\ndon’t say anything about where you found the stuff on my property, it\n\n91\n\n(2 Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFREO04224\n\ncould become a sight for historical preservation and that means the\ngovernment could ultimately own my land.”\n\nT acknowledged his request and told them they were just a gift for my\nMom, who was in love with Indians “Wait until she see’s I brought her\nback real artifacts, she is going to totally freak out.” He didn’t mind that I\nwas taking them. In fact he admired my curiosity and adventurous spirit.\nHe reminded me that tomorrow was my last day. | would be driven to the\nAlbuquerque International Airport the day after next, to meet Jeffrey in\nNew York, for how long, only he knew. Giving Jeffrey many thanks for a\ngreat week, letting him know how much I appreciated these small breaks\naway, we then said goodnight. Hanging up the phone | had caught my\nsecond wind and set out to the kitchen to find a late-night snack. Raiding\nthe fridge and pantry, I found some frozen pizzas and popcorn. | put on a\nmovie and munched on the popcorn while the pizza cooked. Some 1980's\ndreadful alien flick got the better of me that night. [t was based on a true\nstory about people abductions from extraterrestrial beings, which were,\nlike I was, visiting a remote area. I suddenly hated being alone on a ranch\nin the middle of nowhere. | munched down my burnt, crunchy pizza and\nbecame further enveloped in the thick plot. Leaving on the TV and the\nlights on that night, I spent my night tossing and turing, peeking through\nthe small open crevices of the comforter, half expecting to see an alien\nbeing in my bedroom.\n\nLiving through the night was a relief and J laughed at myself in the\nmorning, how spooked did I get? When I got to New York, Jeffrey, and\nGhislane had a good laugh over my tale of survival in the wilderness and\nthen the alien scare. “Your always having the best adventures” Ghislane\nexclaimed. We were similar in that way, both being s bit of free spirits it\nwas really only her non-existence of moral standards that differentiated\nthe two of us, in that way. “How do you know you weren’t abducted and\nprobed? I mean look at you and all that time alone on the ranch, what do\nyou think Jeffrey, could she pass off as an alien?” Expectedly, Ghislane\npoked fun at me, her usual fun past time. Our relationship was an odd\none, never threatened by each other but always precautious towards one\nanother nonetheless able to crack a joke together, but when it came time\nto “work” it was no fun and games, she was intensely serious. “With a\nsense of humor like yours I would tend to think that you are the one from\nanother planet.” Just friendly banter between the two of us, then Jeffrey\nhad to jump in with his two bits, “I think you might be onto something\nGhislane.” I squinted my eyes and gave them both an exaggerated death\nstare and pretended to grab my stomach in pain, “I think some things\ntrying to get out of me”, putting my fist in my shirt to reenact a scene\nfrom Alien, I fell onto the couch and faked my death. “I knew it”\nGhislane shouted and jumped on me to begin tickling me all over and we\n\n92\n\nM1 Copyright Protected Material\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021190",
