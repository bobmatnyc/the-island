  "text": "questions on the past and future of the\nIsraeli-Palestinian problem.\n\nFP: What were your best and worst\nmoments in the Israeli-Palestinian\nnegotiations, and what was the greatest\nmissed opportunity?\n\nSaeb Erekat: Though I was not the chief\nnegotiator at that moment, the connection\nbetween [then Prime Minister Yitzhak]\nRabin and President Arafat made\neveryone around them, including myself,\nfeel that peace was possible. There was\nsignificant progress in all tracks until\nRabin's assassination by an Israeli\nterrorist -- after he was killed, no Israeli\nleader had the vision to understand that\nthe window of opportunity for a two-state\nsolution would close as fast as they\ncontinued their colonization policies.\n\nThe missed opportunity has definitely\nbeen Israel throwing away the Arab\nPeace Initiative, which offers\nnormalization of relations of 57 countries\nwith Israel in exchange for Israeli\nwithdrawal to the 1967 border. They\nthrew it away by bombing Gaza, by\nintensifying collective punishments, and\nby increasing settlement construction all\nover the occupied West Bank,\nparticularly in and around Occupied East\nJerusalem.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029700",
