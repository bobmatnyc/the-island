What happened here to the justice system?\n\nConchita Sarnoff\nhttp://www.thedailyb...hile- goes-free/\nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced three current events\n\ndebate television aaah The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report.\n\nHedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a depraved world of thrice-daily massages,\n\npornographic artwork, and hush money—that’s only now being revealed. Conchita Sarnoff follows up on her investigation of the legal\nwrangling that saved him from a long prison term and reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also:\n\n* Palm Beach’s police chief objected to Epstein’s “special treatment” and gave The Daily Beast an exclusive look at his nine-hour\ndeposition about the investigation.\n\nues genes\n\n* The victims also alleged trips out of state and abroad on Epstein’s private jets, which would be evidence of sex trafficking—a much\n\nmore serious federal crime than the state charges Epstein was convicted of.\n\n* Epstein’s attorneys investigated members of the Palm Beach Police Department, while others ordered private investigators to follow and\nintimidate the victims’ families; one even posed as a police officer.\n\nFilm director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a life of privilege. On Wednesday,\n\nhedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house arrest in Palm Beach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski’s\ntime at a Swiss ski chalet.\n\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis\n\nDuring Epstein’s term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and his private Caribbean island. In the\nearlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor—13 months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his\n\noffice each day. Meanwhile, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to perform\n\nan amount that will hardly dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\n\n* Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe\n* The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den\n\nWith that, the known victims of Epstein’s sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case against him is closed unless new\nones come forward. oni ee Mee an ore\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029625",
