  "text": "severe form of trafficking in persons and eligible for continued presence. Finally, Federal law\nenforcement involvement in the process allows Federal prosecutors the ability to identify\npatterns of human trafficking activity that might span multiple local law enforcement\njurisdictions. For these same reasons, the new subsection (3)(B) should add “Federal” before\n“law enforcement” to limit the authority to request parole for relatives to Federal law\nenforcement officials.\n\nThe new subsection (c)(3)(A\\{ii) should add “endeavor to” after “shall” so that a legally\nactionable obligation is not created as to Federal law enforcement’s role in protecting the safety\nof trafficking victims and family members. While the U.S. Government makes every effort to\nprotect trafficking victims, the statutory language, as written, could be construed to create a\nlegally cognizable right and could lead to litigation.\n\nIn the new subsection (c)(3)(A)(iii), DOJ opposes extending continued presence for the\nduration of a civil suit. It also raises the potential for abuse because of the lengthy and\nplaintiff/victim-controlled delays in conducting civil litigation. Furthermore, physical presence\nin the United States is not necessary for the successful maintenance of a civil action. Victims\nhave other options to obtain status in the United States, such as T- and U-visas.\n\nDOJ notes a technical change to subsection (d), which currently has two subsection (2)s.\nDOJ recommends striking the second “(2)” and replacing it with a “(3).”\n\nI. Section 202\n\nThe Department opposes the language in section (a) that legislates the existence of a\nspecific task force, such as the Trafficking in Persons and Worker Exploitation Task Force. DOJ\nrecommends deletion of this reference and the replacement of the cue task force with “the i\nAttorney General.”\n\nDOJ also opposes the 120 day deadline in subsection (f) as unreasonable due to language\nbarriers and translation needs.\n\n12. Section 203\n\nIn subsections (a), (b)(1-2), and (c), DOJ opposes the language removing the Attorney\nGeneral’s role in determining whether the relevant applicant has complied with reasonable\nrequests for assistance, an important factor in the decisions regarding T-visas, and that the\ninvestigation or prosecution is complete. Because the Department is involved in its prosecutorial\nas well as its investigative roles, DOJ participation is critical in assessing assistance with law\nenforcement, and it is well-situated to assess whether a victim has complied with reasonable\nrequests for assistance that went through investigative agencies outside DHS, such as cases\ninvestigated by FBI or DOL. Therefore, a joint determination is appropriate because of the\nnumber of different law enforcement agencies that may be involved in a particular matter. i\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012376",
