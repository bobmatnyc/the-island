President Clinton kept stressing the importance of showing Arafat at least\nsome movement on the Oslo front. In September 1999, I took a first, significant\nstep in that direction. I agreed to a timetable that would deliver the Wye\nredeployments by the end of January 2000, while also committing us to negotiating\na framework agreement, on the model of the Begin-Sadat Camp David accords, on\nthe “permanent-status” peace issues. In early November, I joined Clinton and\nArafat for talks around an event in Oslo — a deliberate echo of the optimism with\nwhich the peace process had begun, held on the fourth anniversary of Rabin’s\nassassination. Both Leah Rabin and Peres came with me. Its centerpiece was a\nmemorial service, at which Leah spoke very movingly of the need for both sides to\nfinish the work Yitzhak had begun, a responsibility I pledged that we would do\neverything in our power to fulfill. Only Arafat struck a discordant note. He paired a\ntribute to Rabin with a polemic call for an end to “occupation, exile and\nsettlements.”\n\nAfter the ceremony, he, President Clinton and I met at the American\nambassador’s residence. I was still struck by Arafat’s public comments: by his\napparent desire, or need, to play to hardliners back home in what was supposed to\nbe a time to remember and honor Yitzhak. I didn’t raise his remarks directly, but I\ntold him that each of us was approaching a moment of truth for the future of our\npeople. The decisions required wouldn’t be easy politically, for either of us. “But if\nwe don’t have the courage to make them, we’ll be burying thousands of our\npeople.” Worse, I said, those deaths would not advance his people’s position, or\nmine, by a single inch. When future Palestinian and Israeli leaders did finally prove\nequal to the challenge of making peace, they’d be looking at the same conflict,\nrequiring the same compromises. “The only difference will be the size of our\ncemeteries.” Arafat nodded occasionally. But he said little, beyond saying that he\nconsidered Rabin to have been a friend, and repeating his now-familiar,\nnonspecific, pledge to “do what is necessary” for peace.\n\n“The hardest part won’t be the tough decisions in negotiations,” I continued. “It\nwon't be facing each other. It will be facing our own people.” We would need to\nmake the case openly, honestly, strongly that the peace agreement we reached was\nin the interest of both Israelis and Palestinians. And in this, each of us had a\n\n330\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028178",
