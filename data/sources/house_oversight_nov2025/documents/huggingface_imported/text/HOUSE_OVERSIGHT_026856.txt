On 22-23 June 2018, the Chinese Communist Party concluded its Central Conference on Work
Relating to Foreign Affairs, the second since Xi Jinping became General Secretary of the Party
and Chairman of the Central Military Commission in November 2012. The last one was held in

what it all means, discerning what is new, what is new-ish, and what is not.

WHAT IS NEW?

How does the 2018 Work Conference compare with the one in 2014? The 2014 iteration
represented the formal, official funeral of Deng Xiaoping’s international policy dictum of the
