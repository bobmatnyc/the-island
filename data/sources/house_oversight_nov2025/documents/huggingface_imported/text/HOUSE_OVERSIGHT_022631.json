I suspect very soon he\nwill have us in a War. Neither Hillary the dike or obama respects our service men and they should both be put\nin jail for how they handled our men in that ugly country. God Bless America As We Knew It and In God We\ntrust. NO MORE DEMORATS OR GAYS FOR PRESIDENT.\n\n10.\nCarl\n\nMarch 27, 2014 at 1:06 pm — Log in to Reply\n\n>>> THIS MUST BE ” STRIKE # 9 ” OF SLICK WILLIE <<< ANYONE WHO WOULD LISTEN TO HIS B\n.S.NOW MUST BE JUST AS DEPRAVED AS HE IS .
