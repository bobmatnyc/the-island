Herb tells you to give them a hug, Revson tells you to\nkick them in the balls, and I tell you to solve the problem by eliminating it altogether: Remove the\nhuman element.\n\nOnce you have a product that sells, it’s time to design a self-correcting business architecture that runs\nitself.\n\nThe Remote-Control CEO\n\nThe power of hiding ourselves from one another is mercifully given, for men are wild beasts,\nand would devour one another but for this protection.\n\n—HENRY WARD BEECHER, U.S. abolitionist and clergyman, “Proverbs from Plymouth Pulpit”\n\nRURAL PENNSYLVANIA\n\nL, a 200-year-old stone farmhouse, a quiet “experiment in 21st-century leadership” is proceeding\n\nexactly as planned.*4Stephen McDonnell is upstairs in his flip-flops looking at a spreadsheet on his\ncomputer. His company has increased its annual revenue 30% per year since it all began, and he is able\nto spend more time with his three daughters than he ever thought possible.\n\nThe experiment? As CEO of Applegate Farms, he insists on spending just one day per week at the\ncompany headquarters in Bridgewater, New Jersey.

Limiting contact with managers forces the entrepreneur to develop operational rules that enable\nothers to deal with problems themselves instead of calling for help.\n\nThis isn’t just for small operations. Applegate Farms sells more than 120 organic and natural meat\nproducts to high-end retailers and generates more than $35 million in revenue per year.\n\nIt is all possible because McDonnell started with the end in mind.\n\nBehind the Scenes: The Muse Architecture\n\nOrders are nobody can see the Great Oz! Not nobody, not nohow!\n— GUARDIAN OF THE EMERALD CITY GATES, The Wizard of Oz\n\nS tarting with the end in mind—an organizational map of what the eventual business will look like—is\nnot new.\n\nInfamous deal-maker Wayne Huizenga copied the org chart of McDonald’s to turn Blockbuster into a\nbillion-dollar behemoth, and dozens of titans have done much the same.
