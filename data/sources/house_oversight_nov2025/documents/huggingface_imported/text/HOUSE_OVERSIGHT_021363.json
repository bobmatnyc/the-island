  "text": "Some people experience God speaking\ndirectly to them in an easy relationship.\nOthers do not.\n\nAs aresult of my involvement\nwith the Templeton group, I decided to\ncarry out some quantitative and\nexperimental work to see whether we\ncould figure out the differences between\nthose who found it easy to do this work,\nand those for whom it was difficult. That\nwork suggests that there is a\npsychological capacity that makes the\nprocess of knowing this kind of God\neasier, though its absence does not\nprevent religious experience, and its\npresence does not predict it. It is the\ncapacity for absorption, which is at the\nheart of imagination. Absorption is the\ncapacity to focus one’s attention on a\nnon-instrumental (and often internal)\nobject while disattending to everyday\nexterior surrounds. Absorption is related\nto hypnosis and dissociation, but not\nidentical to either. All of us go into light\nabsorption states when we settle into a\nbook and let the story carry us away.\nThere are no known physiological\nmarkers of an absorption state, but as the\nabsorption grows deeper, the person\nbecomes more difficult to distract, and\nhis sense of time and agency begins to\nshift. He lives within his imagination\nmore, whether that be simple\nmindfulness or elaborate fantasy, and he\nfeels that the experience happens to him,\nthat he is a bystander to his own\nawareness, more himself than ever\nbefore, or perhaps absent, but in any\ncase different. And as the absorption\ngrows deeper, people often experience\nmore imagery and more sensory\nphenomena, sometimes with\nhallucinatory vividness. Scholars do not\ndiscuss training in absorption, although\nresearchers of hypnosis and dissociation\n\n117\n\nPage\n\nare clear that some kind of practice\neffects can be seen. °\n\nConclusion\n\nPrayer is basically training in\nabsorption, at least the kind of prayer in\nwhich the person praying focuses\ninwardly and disattends to the everyday\nworld in order to engage with God. It\nwould be hard to over-estimate the\nimportance placed on prayer and prayer\nexperience in a church like this and\nindeed, in Christian America today.\nMany of the best-selling Christian books\nare books on prayer technique, and they\nsell in the millions. Such books often\nbegin by presenting the concrete sensory\nexperience of God described in the\nHebrew Bible as the everyday\nrelationship for which the ordinary\nbeliever should strive. In these manuals,\nthe act of praying is understood as a skill\nthat has to be deliberately learned. I\ndiscovered that these evangelical\ncongregants assumed that prayer was a\nskill which had to be taught, that it was\nhard, that not everyone was good at it,\nand that those who were naturally good\nand well trained would experience\nchanges associated with a more richly\ndeveloped inner world. Their mental\nimages would seem sharper; they would\nbe more likely to report unusual sensory\nexperiences. They would be more able,\nin short, to experience God. The more\nquantitative work—done in\ncollaboration with Howard Nusbaum\nand Ron Thisted--suggests that those\nwho have a proclivity for absorption and\nwho trained that proclivity through\nprayer are indeed more able to\naccomplish the demanding learning that\nthis concept of God sets out.* They are\nmore able to identify God’s presence in\ntheir mind. They are more likely to\nexperience God as an invisible\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021363",
