  "text": "worker asked this question on behalf of the world’s second most-populous\nnation:\n\n“Tt is often said that India does not dream big and that is the root cause of\nall our problems. Why can’t we dream like China, Europe or America?”\n\nNote how Mr. Modi compares India to other continental powers. This\nreveals just how much today’s 1.25 billion Indians, who are digitally\nhitched to the global flow of ideas, have adopted new views of their\ncapacity for progress — not only for India but for themselves.\n\nDuring his campaign, Modi tapped into this rising aspiration for India to\nemulate the best in other countries. One in eight voters went to the polls\nfor the first time, a sign of the fact that two-thirds of the population is\nunder 35. He and his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) promised economic\ngrowth, clean governance, and decisive leadership, all of which Modi\ndelivered as chief minister of Gujarat state — although sometimes too\nharshly or divisively.\n\nHis record and his campaign promises really reflect an India ready to join\nthe global community. Voter turnout was a record 66 percent. And the\nelectoral results cut across the old divides of caste, rural vs urban, old vs.\nyoung, poor vs. middle-class. On those measures alone, India has\nsurpassed China, which is not even allowed to have elections, and the\npolitical disunity in Europe and America.\n\nThe BJP’s election sweep was achieved in part out of public frustration\nwith the long-ruling Congress party. Its corrupt, paternalistic, and dynastic\nstyle no longer fits an India of smart phones and social mobility. More\nthan two-thirds of Indians are dissatisfied with their country’s direction,\naccording to a Pew poll. In throwing off the past, voters have allowed the\nBJP to rule with a clear majority in the lower house of parliament. Such a\nfeat was achieved only once before, in 1984, after the assassination of\nIndira Gandhi boosted the Congress party in an election.\n\nAs prime minister, Modi must not forget he is riding an awakening of\nIndian expectations as much as leading them. His checkered past as a\nHindu nationalist, and in sometimes treating India’s Muslims as less than\ncitizens, cannot color his leadership in a constitutional democracy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031579",
