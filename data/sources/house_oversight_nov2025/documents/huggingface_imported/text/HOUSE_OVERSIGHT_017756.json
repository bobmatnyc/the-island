Without the explicit\nlisting of this exception, some trial courts simply overlooked the victim's right to attend - most notoriously in the Oklahoma\nCity bombing trial. 7°4\n\n[*907] Merely relying on Rule 615 to protect the victim's right to attend proceedings, however, would be inadequate. First, the\ndefendant's right to attend proceedings is deemed sufficiently important to merit treatment in a specific rule mn the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure - Rule 43. This proposed victim's rule, Rule 43.1, would even-handedly mirror that treatment for\nvictims.\n\nSecond, Federal Rule of Evidence 615 does not comprehensively address the victim's right to attend proceedings. For starters, it\nwould seem that the Advisory Committee Notes in the Federal Rules of Evidence now need a revision to reference the CVRA.\nOtherwise, judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel might simply be unaware that a victim is now \"authorized by statute\" - the\n\nCVRA - to be present. 75° Even if legal professionals realize the CVRA's ramifications, most crime victims are not lawyers and\nlack experience in the criminal justice system. Therefore, their rights need to be laid out in the most direct manner possible by\nlisting their right to attend any public court proceeding in the criminal rules.\n\nFinally, providing the details of the victim's right to attend is important for practical reasons. The CVRA qualifies the victim's\nright to attend by requiring exclusion in those rare cases when the victim's testimony \"would be materially altered if the victim\nheard other testimony at that proceeding.\" 78° The CVRA, however, contains additional procedural requirements that judges\nmust follow before excluding a victim in such situations: \"Before making a determination ... [to exclude a victim], the court\nshall make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the\nexclusion of the victim from the criminal proceeding.\" 78” Presumably, these reasonable alternatives include having the victim\ntestify first and then watching all the following witnesses testify, 75° something judges are authorized to require. 78? The Act\nalso requires that \"the reasons for any decision denying relief under this chapter shall be clearly stated on [*908] the record.\"\n290 These procedural requirements are new and potentially complex. Moreover, issues surrounding victim attendance at\ncriminal proceedings are likely to occur frequently. Victims can appeal any exclusion order, and appellate courts must take up\nthose appeals expeditiously. 7?! Accordingly, it is important that lawyers, judges, and victims have the new rule and its\nprocedural requirements at their fingertips, rather than being forced to dig it out through some cross-reference to the United\nStates Code. For all these reasons, subsection (a) of the proposed rule simply tracks verbatim the substantive and procedural\nrequirements of the CVRA.\n\nProposed Rule 43.1(a) also limits the victim's right to attend \"public\" proceedings. It is clear that the CVRA intended to make\nno change in the circumstances in which proceedings could be closed to the public. As Senators Kyl and Feinstein explained in\na colloquy regarding the law: \"The Government or the defendant can request, and the court can order, judicial proceedings to\n\n282 See Fed. R.
