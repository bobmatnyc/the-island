  "text": "unacknowledged conflict between this goal and another of the\nauthors’ recommendations—ratification of the Comprehensive Test\nBan Treaty. That treaty could lock us in to weapons designs that are\nless safe and secure than others that might one day be developed, but\nwhose development might necessitate testing. (The current\nadministration’s ideological opposition to any innovation in the\ndesign of our increasingly obsolete weapons—with the result that we\nare not, for example, introducing technology to make them unusable,\nshould they fall into unauthorized hands—is overly rigid and\nshortsighted. It is too bad that the authors of the statement didn’t\nmake this point.)\n\nShultz, Kissinger, et al. correctly urge that international measures be\ntaken to place control of the nuclear fuel cycle in safe hands. But\naccomplishing this task is complicated by the legacy of the “Atoms\nfor Peace” concept dating back to the Eisenhower administration and\nenshrined in the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Rich in\nunintended consequences, Atoms for Peace promised that nations\npledging (1.e., merely pledging) not to acquire nuclear weapons\nwould be eligible to receive assistance with their civilian nuclear\nprograms from the advanced nuclear powers. The problem is that the\ninfrastructure supporting civilian nuclear power gets you well down\nthe road to nuclear weapons. In fact, from its inception, Atoms for\nPeace has spread nuclear technology around the world. India’s\nnuclear program, for example, grew from its cooperation with\nCanada, which supplied the reactor that enabled India’s bomb.\n\nThe NPT has become the poster child for opposition to the spread of\nnuclear weapons. Yet, ironically, faith in its capacity actually to\nrestrain the proliferation of nuclear weapons is at least misplaced—\nand possibly much worse. For one thing, the belief that the NPT is\nrobust enough, and its institutions effective enough, can easily\nbecome an excuse for individual nations to do no more than the treaty\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023495",
