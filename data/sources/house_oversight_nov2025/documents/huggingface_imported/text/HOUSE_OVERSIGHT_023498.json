  "text": "12\n\nexisting nuclear states to advance toward that goal, will do more to\nspread than contain nuclear weapons—directly, by encouraging some\ncurrent non-nuclear states to consider developing nuclear weapons,\nand indirectly, by displacing and undermining other more effective\nstrategies. At the heart of the case for global zero is an argument—\nthat reductions (on the way to zero) in our nuclear force will lead\nothers to reduce theirs or curtail or abandon plans to acquire them\naltogether—that ignores history, logic, and politics.\n\nOne important reason why most friends and allies of the United\nStates (Britain and France being the exceptions) have not sought\nnuclear weapons of their own has been our readiness to extend the\nprotection of our nuclear deterrent to cover them. Germany, Japan,\nand South Korea, all quite capable of building nuclear weapons, went\nthrough even the precarious periods of the Cold War confident that\nour nuclear force made it unnecessary for them to have nuclear forces\nof their own. Where the United States was unwilling or unable to\noffer protection to countries that believed themselves threatened—\nIndia and Pakistan, for example—those countries did build\nindependent nuclear capabilities. If the United States is seen to be\nheading toward eliminating its nuclear capabilities, countries that\nhave relied on us may decide that they must acquire their own nuclear\nweapons. This is especially true in a region where another state, like\nIran, is pursuing nuclear weapons and is likely to obtain them, thus\nalarming and frightening its neighbors into an arms race they would\nrather avoid. The sad history of the nuclearization of the Indian\nsubcontinent, for instance, appears to have begun with India\nresponding to China’s nuclearization, followed by Pakistan\nresponding to India’s. If the United States is seen to be on a path to\nrelinquishing nuclear weapons, is it reasonable to expect the Japanese\nand the South Koreans, long sheltered by our deterrent, to remain\nindifferent to the nuclear forces of China and North Korea?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023498",
