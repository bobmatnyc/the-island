  "text": "cholesterol by 58 percent versus placebo at week 24 when added to current standard of care, including\nmaximally tolerated statins. n ODYSSEY COMBO I, Praluent 75 mg every two weeks as an adjunct to statins\nreduced LDL cholesterol by an additional 46 percent compared to placebo at week 12. At week 24 in the same\ntrial, Praluent reduced LDL cholesterol by 43 percent compared to placebo. In this study, if additional LDL\ncholesterol lowering was required based on pre-specified criteria at week 8, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg\nat week 12 for the remainder of the trial. Eighty-three percent of patients remained on their initial 75 mg dose.\nPraluent is generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Local injection site reactions including\nredness, itching, swelling or pain/tenderness where the injection is given were the most common events (7.2\npercent with Praluent versus 5.1 percent with placebo) and resulted in a low discontinuation rate that was\ncomparable to placebo (0.2 percent with Praluent versus 0.4 percent with placebo). Patients receiving Praluent\nhad a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of\nlonger average duration than patients receiving placebo. Other common adverse events occurring more\nfrequently in patients with Praluent than placebo included symptoms of the common cold and flu or flu-like\nsymptoms.\n\nThe companies carefully considered the potential medical value that Praluent offers patients in determining the\nWholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC). The U.S. WAC price of Praluent is $40 per day ($1,120 every 28 days) for\nboth the 75 mg and 150 mg doses, making Praluent the lowest priced patient-administered monoclonal antibody\ntherapy on an annualized basis. Actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to be lower as\nWAC pricing does not reflect discounts or rebates. Out-of-pocket costs to patients will vary depending on\ninsurance status and eligibility for patient assistance.\n\nSanofi and Regeneron are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Praluent are able\nto access the medicine and receive the support they may need. The companies will launch a comprehensive\nprogram that offers support, training and follow up for patients at every step of the process. The program will\nprovide patient assistance to uninsured or underinsured patients, including providing free medicine to eligible\npatients, and can help identify coverage options for out-of-pocket costs. Additional services include educational\ninformation, clinical support for physicians, nurses and pharmacists, as well as reimbursement services,\nincluding co-pay support for eligible patients and information about insurance eligibility support.

The European\nCommission (EC) is expected to make a final decision on the Marketing Authorization Application for Praluent\nin the European Union in September 2015.\n\nInvestor Relations Conference Call on Praluent\n\nSanofi and Regeneron will be hosting a conference call for the financial community on Praluent® (alirocumab)\nInjection for the treatment of high LDL cholesterol in adult patients. The conference call will take place on\nFriday, July 24, 2015 (21:30 CET / 20:30 BST/ 15:30 EDT / 12:30 PDT).\n\nThe call will be available through audio webcast at www.sanofi.com and www.regeneron.com and also via the\nfollowing telephone numbers:\n\nFrance: +33 (0) 1 70 8071 53\n\nUK:\n\n+44 (0) 203 107 0289\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025891",
