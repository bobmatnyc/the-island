  "text": "and naiveté about the Russian charges. But now there seemed to be a new understanding:\nDonald Trump believed he had vastly more power, authority, and control than in fact he\nhad, and he believed his talent for manipulating people and bending and dominating them\nwas vastly greater than it was. Pushing this line of reasoning just a little further: senior\nstaff believed the president had a problem with reality, and reality was now overwhelming\nhim.\n\nIf true, this notion directly contravened the basic premise of the support for Trump\namong his staff. In some sense, not too closely questioned, they believed he had almost\nmagical powers. Since his success was not explainable, he must have talents beyond what\nthey could fathom. His instincts. Or his salesman’s gifts. Or his energy. Or just the fact\nthat he was the opposite of what he was supposed to be. This was out-of-the-ordinary\npolitics—shock-to-the-system politics—but it could work.\n\nBut what if it didn’t? What if they were all profoundly wrong?\n\nComey’s firing and the Mueller investigation prompted a delayed reckoning that ended\nmonths of willing suspension of disbelief. These sudden doubts and considerations—at the\nhighest level of government—did not quite yet go to the president’s ability to adequately\nfunction in his job. But they did, arguably for the first time in open discussions, go to the\nview that he was hopelessly prone to self-sabotaging his ability to function in the job. This\ninsight, scary as it was, at least left open the possibility that if all the elements of self-\nsabotage were carefully controlled—his information, his contacts, his public remarks, and\nthe sense of danger and threat to him—he might yet be able to pull it together and\nsuccessfully perform.\n\nQuite suddenly, this became the prevailing view of the Trump presidency and the\nopportunity that still beckoned: you can be saved by those around you or brought down by\nthem.\n\nBannon believed the Trump presidency would fail in some more or less apocalyptic\nfashion if Kushner and his wife remained Trump’s most influential advisers. Their lack of\npolitical or real-world experience had already hobbled the presidency, but since the\nComey disaster it was getting worse: as Bannon saw it, they were now acting out of\npersonal panic.\n\nThe Kushner side believed that Bannon or Bannonism had pushed the president into a\nharshness that undermined his natural salesman’s abilities to charm and reach out. Bannon\nand his ilk had made him the monster he more and more seemed to be.\n\nMeanwhile, virtually everybody believed that a large measure of the fault lay in Reince\nPriebus, who had failed to create a White House that could protect the president from\nhimself—or from Bannon or from his own children. At the same time, believing that the\nfundamental problem lay in Priebus was easy scapegoating, not to mention little short of\nrisible: with so little power, the chief of staff simply wasn’t capable of directing either\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020067",
