'Get It Right' is singular priority - we think alike. This is the Role and Importance of pre-production. \nFunds adequate. \nClarity critical, as is charisma. However, given intimacy of TV interviews, it's not always apparent upfront who \ncommunicates well. Usually by not always. Sometimes someone who is a great lecturer to 500 students falls flat \nor off puts as arrogant. Sometimes a mousey introvert with intense eye and facial expressions sparkles and \nradiates. There is no substitute, however, for clarity. \nLooking forward to discussion. \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Dec 29, 2017, at 3:35 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nit need to be about the topic and the person. some of these people are not engaging at all.

Assuming we expand math episodes, we will need more mathematicians. \nHow's late afternoon after 5:30 pm / early evening today? - or weekend, day/times? (Family issues today - \nmother 102 in May.) \nRADICAL BREAKTHROUGHS - Initial Revisions (working model for discussion, red is new) \nExpand and Modify Mathematical Breakthrough episodes \n1. Mathematics and Truth / Overview / Show Excitement/Importance \n2. Mathematical Fields / Diverse New Kinds and Categories \n3. How Math Works in Disparate Areas of Knowledge (from fundamental physics to chemistry, \nbiology [molecular and evolutionary[, psychology, sociology, economics, etc.) \n4. Power Laws \n5. Mathematical Biology \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029117 \n6. Foundations of Mathematics / Philosophy/Meaning of Math (discovered/invented?) \nADD/Exchange to Biological Breakthrough episodes \n9/10. Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in \nbiomedical and psychological research - the scandal in recent years. \nIn the non-Closer To Truth world.... \nDid CNN Intl this morning on Trump's China-oil-N.Korea-cheating tweet \"Caught RED HANDED...\" \n[pun deliberate] \nMy favorite fun lines (there are so many) in Trump's NYTimes spontaneous interview. \n2) \"I like very much President Xi. He treated me better than anybody's ever been treated in the history of \nChina.\" \nEver (-5,000 year history) \n1) \"I know the details of taxes better than anybody___better than the greatest CPA.\" \nNot, mind you, CPAs in general, not even smart Jewish CPAs who work all the time - but whoever, out \nof 664,532 actively licensed CPAs (2016), is the greatest CPA of them all (#1 in citing code? creative \ndeductions?) - better than him! \nOn Dec 29, 2017, at 6:19 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nlets talk today.

Im around today or hte weekend if you would like \nto chat. \nOn Fri, Dec 29, 2017 at 1:45 AM, Robert Kuhn < > wrote: \n`Blahblahs' forbidden in 'Radical Breakthroughs'. So we need two replacements (for Multiverse as Science \nand Rare Sentience). \nInitial ideas: \n* Expand the first episode \"Mathematics and Truth\" into two or likely three episodes. I'm intrigued by this \nbecause there is so much rich material - pure math, philosophy (discovered or invented), physics (Wigner's \n'unreasonable effectiveness of mathematics in the natural sciences)', astrophysics, cosmology, biology, general \nsystems theory. I've felt frustrated in this first episode because there is so much material. I think three episodes \ncould work - if you agree, I'll get back to you with a suggested structure of the 2 or likely 3 parts. Also, Closer \nTo Truth has had only a few videos and one episode on mathematics per se (out of 277 episodes!), so \nthis would be original and complementary. In this may, math would become about half the series. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029118 \n* Integrated Information Theory - quantifying and explaining consciousness (Giulio Tononi, Un of Wisconsin-\nMadison), plus supporters and critics. New controversial, science-based radical theory. \n* Evolutionary Dynamics - your program at Harvard - mathematical models. This is not an area of my \nexpertise, but it could well fit Closer To Truth in general and Radical Breakthroughs in particular. But you \nneed to tell me if you would like to include this. \n* Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in biomedical \nand especially psychological research - the scandal in recent years. See links and attachments. \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Replication crisis  \nhttps://www.nature.com/news/over-half-of-psychology-studies-fail-reproducibility-test-1.18248  \nhttp://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716  \n\"Replicability vs. Reproducibility\" - http://www.replicability.tau.ac.il/index.php/replicability-in-\nscience/replicability-vs-reproducibility.html  \nFive Ways to Fix Statistics - Nature [attached]. \n* Other possibile areas you suggest \nWe would like to set a mutually agreed schedule so we can confirm and reserve the Closer To Truth 'season' \nof 13 episodes for 'Radical Breakthroughs', which we need to plan well in advance - especially as we begin \n2018. \nSee you Jan. 5 - Looking forward to brainstorming. \nRobert \nOn Dec 28, 2017, at 7:40 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \ngreat work , but needs some editing, did not like multi verse and sensience. seems more blahblah \nOn Mon, Dec 11, 2017 at 12:50 AM, Robert Lawrence Kuhn <11.> wrote: \nHi: When are you back in NY? \nAttached is the complete Preproduction Book for Radical Breakthroughs - now including Misha Gromov! \nLove your feedback, suggestions. \nAlso attached is the budget and timing of funding, as presented originally, now updated for the completion of \npreproduction (phase I).
