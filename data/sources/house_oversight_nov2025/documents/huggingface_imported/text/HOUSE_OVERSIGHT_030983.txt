Alex Acosta update

Earlier this week, pedophile Jeffrey Epstein bought his way out of a lawsuit that would have
given some of his victims the opportunity to testify about his predatory and criminal
conduct. Victims never got that opportunity when Epstein faced criminal charges, because
Alex Acosta — then the lead prosecutor, now the Secretary of Labor — let Epstein off with
a ridiculously lenient sentence. Despite having committed hideous sex offenses with dozens
of minors, Epstein received a sentence of 13 months in jail, during which he was often free
during the day.

Epstein’s decision to buy his out of the civil lawsuit, one that he had the nerve to initiate,
benefits Acosta. The trial would have provided non-stop headlines, coupled with frequent
references to the sweetheart deal Acosta gave him. As Randy Schultz puts it, the trial would
have been the occasion for a long overdue public shaming of Acosta. Now, he avoids this
consequence.

But this doesn’t mean Acosta is out of the woods. He faces calls for his ouster from the
Trump cabinet.

Some calls are from the usual suspects. Michelle Goldberg of the New York Times has
written a piece so obnoxious that it almost makes me want to see Acosta ride out the storm.

But some conservatives are also advocating Acosta’s departure. Concerned Women for
America 1s a stalwart conservative organization. It describes itself, accurately, as “focus[ed]
on seven core issues: the family, the sanctity of human life, religious liberty, education,
sexual exploitation, national sovereignty, and support for Israel.” (Emphasis added)
