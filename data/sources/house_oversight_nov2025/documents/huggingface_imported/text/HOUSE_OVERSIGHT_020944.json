AIG net costs excludes potential gains from selling AIG’s common shares held by the Treasury, which could turn out to be a $22B profit\nfor the Treasury based on 10/1/10 closing price. Including this potential gain, TARP ultimate cost to the Treasury would be $29B. 2) White House OMB estimates\nultimate cash cost of Fannie Mae / Freddie Mac at $165B while the CBO estimates the ultimate cash costs at $160B. Both estimates imply an average default rate of\n5-10% on Fannie Mae + Freddie Mac’s $5T loan guarantee portfolio and a loss severity of 50%. The Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA) estimates ultimate\ncosts to range from $142B to $259B. 3) Net cash costs are limited to discretionary spending items in ARRA.
