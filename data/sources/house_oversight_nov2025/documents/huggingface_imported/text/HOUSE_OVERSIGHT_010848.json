Just did you discuss it with anyone?\n\nMR, SCAROLA: Same objection. Same\n\ninstruction.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Okay.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: If you want to rephrase the\n\nquestion to ask him whether he had such a\nconversation with anyone outside the\nattorney/client or work-product privilege, that's\na question that we are obliged to answer.\n\nThe question, as you phrased it, is a\n\nquestion that we are precluded from answering.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: That's a very strange notion of\n\nprivilege.\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. But let me ask it this way: Did you discuss\nwith anyone who is not an attorney -- let me rephrase it\na different way.\n\nYou testified yesterday about your\nunderstanding of the scope of the alleged\ncommon-interest privilege, correct?\n\nA.

Uh-huh.\n\nQ. -- your definition of it --\n\nA. Right. That's right.\n\nQ. -~ did you discuss the topic -- did anyone\n\ntell you they had discussed the topic of Virginia\nRoberts's allegations against Professor Dershowitz with\nMr. Josefsberg?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: You may not answer that\nquestion to the extent the question still\nencompasses attorney/client privileged\ncommunications. If you want to rephrase the\nquestion to exclude both common-interest\nprivileged communications and attorney/client\nprivileged communications, that's a question we\nare prepared to answer.\n\nOtherwise, we are prohibited from answering\nthe question as phrased as a consequence of it\nencompassing privileged communications.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: As he defined the\ncommon-interest privileged group, it included\nattormey/client, but I think at this point the\nexplanations you're providing aren't really\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n00:28:23\n\n00:28:25,\n\n00:28:27\n\n00:28:29\n\n00:28:31\n\n00:28:33\n\n00:28:38\n\nON Dah WD =\n\n00:28:36\n002839 9\n00:28:42 10\noo2eas 14\noo2847 12\noozeso 13\n00:28:50 14\noozes: 15\nooza62 16\noo2063 17\n00:28:56 18\noo2838 19\noo:20.05 20\noo2e12 24\noozere 22\n00.2920 23\n00.2920 24\noo2920 25\n\n00:29:20\n00:29:22\n00:29:27\n00:28:33\n00:29:35\n00:29:40\n\n00:29:46\n\nON Dar WH\n\n00:29:47\n\n©\n\n00:29:48\noo2a4a 10\n00:29:50 11\noo:3003 12\n00:30:12 13\noo3015 14\ncosets 15\noo3018 16\noso 17\n00:30:20 18\noo3025 19\no0:3028 20\n003031 21\noo3s031 22\n00:30:31 23\n002034 24\noo:30:34 25\n\n182\nhelpful.
