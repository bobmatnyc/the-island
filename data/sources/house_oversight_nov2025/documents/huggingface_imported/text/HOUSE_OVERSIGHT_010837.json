I don't -- I suppose that's, you\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\nknow, a theoretical possibility.\n\nBut -- but the reason I ruled out that\npossibility, first, it didn't seem likely; but secondly,\nthere was a pattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading\nefforts to get information from them.\n\nAnd so let me just go back to the earliest\ninstance of that. According to the Chief of Police in\nthe Palm Beach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department,\nMr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available\nMr. Epstein for questions about the ~- the sex, you\nknow, abuse that was going on. And, you know,\n\nMr, Dershowitz had said to the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment, yeah, we will make him available; no, we got\nto reschedule it; you know, and then another time,\nreschedule, another time. And so there were multiple --\naccording to the Chief of Police, there had been\n\nmultiple, you know, requests to interview Mr. Epstein\n\nand Mr. Dershowitz had repeatedly said: Oh, yeah, we\nwill schedule that, and then it hadn't happened.\n\nNow, obviously, there could have been a\nsituation there where, you know, an emergency had come\nup for Mr. Epstein and he wasn't able to make a schedule\nor something like that. But what I saw was a -~ was a\npattern of offers to -- to meet and then withdrawals,\nand that seemed to me to be a deliberately calculated\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(254) 331-4400\n\nPage 109 to 112 of 151\n\n111\n\no21e00 1 strategy to sort of stall the investigation to say:\n\naie03 2 Well, we will get you Epstein; oh, we can't meet now;\n02:18:03 3 oh, we will get it now -- and then -- and so forth.\n\nozte04 | 4 And one of the things that I noted from all\noztecs «5 ~©6that was that Mr. Dershowitz, as Mr. Epstein's attorney,\nozis02 «6 never ultimately produced Epstein for a meeting with the\noz1e14 7 Palm Beach Police Department, having made another offer.\noni = 8 Now, obviously, something could have happened\nowis 9 there, I mean, I don't -- you know, I don't know what\n021821 10 was the communications and so forth, but as an attorney\n021824 11 trying to get information and unable to do that, I had\n021822 12 to make some reasonable inferences.\n\no21820 13 And so one of the inferences I began to draw\n21631 14 was that this was a stall tactic by Mr. Dershowitz, and\no218:34 15 in my view, potentially, an unethical one, but I\n\n021837 16 don't -- I don't think we need to get into that in this\n\no2is3e 17 ~~ litigation.\n\noztazo 18 What I saw was a stall tactic going on,\n02184419 and -- and the reason I think it was a stall tactic, as\n\no2146 20 we are sitting here now in, what is it, October of 2015,\ne151 21 and Mr. Epstein has never been willing to answer\n\n021884 22 questions about his sexual abuse of these girls.\n\noz1ess 23 And this was back in around -- what was it?\n021901 24 I quess it would be 2005, 2006, you know, roughly a\noz1906 25 decade ago, Mr. Dershowitz was offering to make Epstein\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n112\n\noz1007 1 available. And then that never happened, and given the\no2te11 2 ten-year pattern that -- that developed -- I guess I\n\n21912 3 should go back. I'm sorry. Let me correct my answer.\noz 4 We should go back to December 30th, 2014. So\nota7 § there -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period\n021921 § of time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer\no2z1924 Y any questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,\no21322 8 Mr. Dershowitz said, oh, it’s just a scheduling issue\n\n021930 9 and -- and we will get the Palm Beach Police Department\noz1933 10 to -- to, you know, to meet and ~- and learn all this.\n\noztsa7 14 The other thing that I'm -- that I'm seeing\no21¢30 12 here, so now there's -- there's -- Mr. Dershowitz had\n021942 13 been involved in concealing Mr. Epstein from the Palm\noz1e46 14 Beach Police Department, but there were others that had\no2te47 18 done similar sorts of things.\n\nozra40 16 So one of them was a Ghislaine Maxwell. I\noz1955 17 will just call her Glenn Maxwell. I think that's kind\n\no2z955 18 of the nickname I understand she goes by.\n\noztese 19 So Glenn Maxwell -- remember, she is -- she\n21959 20 is the one, you know, I think the record is clear, in ~~\ne200 21 in--in litigation that, you know, an allegation has\n\n22006 22 been made that she was the one that -- that brought\no22008 23 Virginia Roberts into the -- into the sex trafficking,\n\no22012 24 and was heavily involved with -- you know, on all the --\no22015 25 not all the flights, but on many of the flights with\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n28 of 38 sheets\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010837",
