  "text": "The lack of economic support from donor nations and the restrictions that\nimpede the Palestinian economy from functioning at anywhere near its full\npotential have also made for a deadly cocktail for Abbas’ Palestinian\nAuthority. Combined with the occasional holding of Palestinian tax\nrevenue by the Israelis, the PA is finding it incredibly difficult to pay the\ntens of thousands of employees on its payroll.\n\nThe recent Israeli parliamentary elections perhaps best illustrate where the\nPalestinian issue is today: at the bottom of the barrel. Israeli politicians\nchose to focus their campaigning on social and economic issues, from the\nprice of housing and cost of living to whether religious students should be\ndrafted into the Israeli military like everyone else. The only Israeli\ncandidate who spoke about the need to reengage the Palestinians in peace\ntalks was the former foreign minister Tzipi Livni, whose party failed to\nreach double-digits in the incoming parliament.\n\nThe overall message is depressingly familiar to Palestinians: creating a\nPalestinian state in the West Bank, Gaza Strip, and East Jerusalem is\nsimply not on the list of priorities for Israel at the current time. And the\nPalestinian Authority is proving itself to be an increasingly fragile\ngoverning body without the constant generosity of foreign countries; it’s\nan institution that cannot adequately care for its people, let alone its\nemployees who go months without pay. The average Palestinian is losing\nhope that peace is possible in his or her lifetime. Palestinian leaders may\nspeak of ending the occupation, but for those who live under it, the\noccupation 1s so ingrained that escaping it has become a violation of the\nnormal.\n\nSome may take the more militant attitudes of Palestinians as confirmation\nthat Israel does not have a partner for peace. Yet those attitudes can also\nbe viewed differently: without a renewed effort at peacemaking, however\nfrustrating and difficult it will be, the conflict will reach a nadir where\nsearching for a peace partner will be irrelevant.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018222",
