  "text": "Equity styles\n\nUBS view Prefer mid caps in US, large caps in Europe\n\n° We believe that medium-sized companies (mid caps) will outperform large caps in the US. US economic\ndata is forecast to stabilize and then show moderate economic growth in the second half of 2012 and into\n2013. The greater domestic sales exposure of US mid caps reduces the earnings risk coming from Europe.\n\ne In Europe, we prefer companies with a large market capitalization (large caps) over ones with a small one\n(small caps) in the current very challenging economic environment. Small caps generate more sales in\nContinental Europe than large caps. Thus, they are more negatively affected by weak domestic demand.\nSmall caps also have a more cyclical earnings exposure than large caps.\n\n¢ Globally, high-quality dividend paying stocks promise to provide a real and stable income stream to\ninvestors in the current low-yield environment. Furthermore, they give exposure to the long-term potential\nof equity markets while tending to suffer less in declining markets.\n\nA Positive scenario Prefer value, low quality and small caps\n\ne Leading indicators continue to move higher, and risks related to the Eurozone debt crisis subside. In this\ncase, add deep cyclical value (cheap price/book, price/earnings) regardless of the sector, with high beta and\nhigh leverage. In such an environment, small and mid-cap stocks should also perform well. A dividend\nstrategy would be too defensive to outperform the market.\n\n& Negative scenario Prefer quality and large caps\n\n¢ The global economic picture deteriorates markedly. In this case, buy high-quality growth companies and\nlarge caps. Do not look for value opportunities, but be as defensive as possible with your equity exposure.\nLook to high-quality, dividend-paying stocks for yield.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nEarnings revisions — see\nchart\n(3-month moving\n\naverage upgrades vs.\ndowngrades)\n\nWatch for signs of improvement in earnings revisions (aggregated from stock\nlevel). An improved earnings outlook would cause investors to add more risk -\ninfluencing our preferences among equity styles.\n\nUS and Eurozone PMls PMls are important for earnings generation and preferences for value, growth\n\nand size.

Moderate economic growth should\nsupport their earnings generation.\n\ne In the US, there are opportunities in value\nnames that also show strong growth.\n\ne Within Europe, we avoid small caps and\ninstead rotate into large caps.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne We expect value strategies to outperform\nthe European market over a multi-year\ntime horizon.\n\ne Mid-cap stocks provide attractive\nopportunities over the longer term.\n\nAvoid small caps and favor large caps\nin Europe\nDJ STOXX small over large and business\n\nconfidence\n1.3 10\n{\" )\n1.2 0\n14 (5)\n(10)\n1.0 (15)\nLarge caps (20)\n09 ' outperforming (95)\nos (30)\n(35)\no7 (40)\n\n2003 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012\n\n=—— Small cap over large cap Eurozone business sentiment (rhs)\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters, UBS, as of September 29, 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is no indication for future returns.\n\n21\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025268",
