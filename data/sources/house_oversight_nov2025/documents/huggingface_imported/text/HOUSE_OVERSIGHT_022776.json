  "text": "From:\n\nSent: Friday, January 22, 2016 2:28 PM\nTo: Jeffrey Epstein\n\nSubject: Help!\n\nImportance: High\n\nSince I need and at this point want to move off this breathtaking property, I want to be able to buy a home in\nNJ, with $0 savings, = impossible. With salary and cost of living, I don't get ahead. Also my luck with men and\nrelying on a man for support is the worst idea. Average homes in NJ are $400-$500K ugh I also still have to pay\noff student loan, ($9,809.74).\n\nOn Wednesday, January 20, 2016, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\nwhat do you suggest?\n\nOn Wed, Jan 20, 2016 at 7:19 PM, i ote:\n\nHappy birthday, I remember the few I had spent with you, good memories!\n\nThe problem is that you may appreciate my support but that doesn't help me. Yes, I told you I can't have\npeople coming here to ask about you and ex pals.... My landlord may shoot them. He is pissed. I need your\nhelp. Out of all the people you should be helping is someone who actually genuinely cared about you.i realize\nyou're living the good life and I'm not your concern, but if you really appreciated my support then you'd help\nme otherwise I don't know what I'll do.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 20, 2016, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\ni appreciate your support is what i meant. has anyting happened recently? it is my birthday today\n\nOn Tue, Jan 19, 2016 at 10:46 PM, [iS rote:\n\nAppreciate what? I'm not sure you do. Be back for what? Where? I don't need to be photographed. I am\ntrying to avoid that, hence the reason why I moved out here. I don't need people coming here looking for me\nto give them information about you or the \"people\" I was documented with... It's not my property. I don't\nthink you get it.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 19, 2016, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\ni appreciate it. I should be back feb 14,\n\nOn Tue, Jan 19, 2016 at 6:39 PM, [ii rote:\n\nBecause you were not available to meet me in person last year and at this point I don’t need to be seen. I can not have press,\nmedia, private investigators, film companies, etc. contacting me or my parents and sisters at home or on cell/texts and or by\nmail. I realize you don’t have much control over this, but you can at least help me to move. I can’t just get up and go like you.\nI left the city to escape, make a better life and I am devastated these people found me and brought to light an association of that\nI would rather them never to know. People think I was involved with something really bad and I lost a boyfriend of great\npotential over this shit. I am still in debt over all these years, been working my ass off trying to get ahead, which you could\nnever understand I was even surviving off the pay I was getting. Well, its not any better. I dropped out of college because of\nyou (and GM’s) advice. Started working for a company you wanted me to and basically my life has has become hell since then.\n\n1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022776",
