However, as Windsor showed, it is\na valuable tax benefit for larger estates.\n\nMany same-sex married couples may find\nit valuable to revisit their estate plans to\n\nmake certain that interests passing to the\nother spouse qualify for the marital de-\n\nduction and other tax benefits.\n\nPortability. The American Taxpayer Relief\nAct of 2012 extended permanently the con-\ncept of portability, which generally allows\nthe estate of a surviving spouse to utilize the\nunused portion of the estate tax applicable\nexclusion amount of his or her last prede-\nceased spouse. Because of DOMA, only\nopposite-sex married couples could take ad-\nvantage of portability.\n\nIMPACT. The Supreme Courts decision\npresumably enables same-sex married\ncouples to take advantage of portability as\npart of their estate planning. The IRS is\n\nexpected to issue guidance.\n\nGifts. Because of DOMA, only opposite-\nsex married couples were allowed to “split”\ngifts to take advantage of a doubled annual\ngift tax exclusion ($14,000 for 2013, for\na total tax-free gift of $28,000). DOMA\npresented even more of a disadvantage\nfor same-sex married couples in that only\ntransfers between spouses, where both in-\ndividuals are U.S. citizens, are allowed an\nunlimited gift tax exclusion under Code\nSec. 2523.\n\nIMPACT. Same-sex married couples can\nnow presumably transfer assets between\nthemselves with no concern of lifetime gift\ntax consequences. This creates consider-\nably greater flexibility for estate planning.\nThe IRS is expected to issue guidance.\n\nCOMMENT. Gifts to cover medical and\neducation expenses for an individual, if\npaid directly to the medical or education\nprovider, are gift tax free without limit\nand are not counted against the annual\n$14,000 exclusion for any individual.\n\nCOMMENT. Where one Spouse is not a\nU.S. citizen, the annual exclusion from\n\ngift taxes for gifts made to the noncitizen\nspouse is $143,000 for 2013.\n\nEMPLOYEE BENEFITS\n\nPerhaps in no area outside of income taxes is\nthe impact of the Supreme Court’s decision\nmore expansive than on employee benefits.\nBecause of DOMA, employers that allow an\nemployee to add his or her same-sex spouse\nto their health plan had to impute income\nto the employee for federal income tax pur-\nposes equal to the fair market value of health\ncoverage provided to the same-sex spouse.\nIf the same-sex spouse qualified as a depen-\ndent, this rule did not apply. DOMA also\nprecluded same-sex married couples from\nsharing the same benefits of health flexible\nspending accounts, health savings accounts\nand health reimbursement arrangements\navailable to opposite-sex married couples.\n\nIMPACT. Employers in states that allow\nsame-sex marriage will presumably need\nto amend plans to cover same-sex married\nspouses. The IRS is expected to provide guid-\nance on the timing of plan amendments, in-\ncluding the issue of whether benefits need to\nbe made retroactive or only prospective from\n\nthe date of the Windsor decision.\n\nDomestic Partners. Many employee ben-\nefit plans in the private and public sectors\nrefer to domestic partners rather than same-\nThe definition of domestic\n\nIn some cases, it may en-\n\nSex spouses.\npartner varies.\ncompass opposite-sex domestic partners as\nwell as same-sex domestic partners.\n\nCOMMENT. The federal governments\nOffice of Personnel Management defines\ndomestic partner for purposes of federal\nemployee benefits as a committed relation-\nship between two adults, of the same sex.\n\nTax Treatment. Domestic partners who are\nnot married under state law are not treated\nas spouses for federal income tax purposes.\nAs a result, an employee must continue\nto pay taxes on the fair market value of\nthe coverage for the employee's domestic\npartner (whether the domestic partner is a\n\nsame-sex partner or an opposite-sex part-\nner). However, domestic partner benefits\nare tax-free if the employee's partner quali-\nfies as a dependent under Code Sec. 152;\nthat is, if benefits are paid for a person who\nmeets the following requirements:\n\nm Receives more than half of his or her\nsupport from the taxpayer for the year.\n\nm Uses the taxpayer's home as the principal\nabode and is a member of the taxpayer's\nhousehold during the entire tax year.\n\nm Is in a relationship with the taxpayer\nthat is not a violation of local law.\n\nIMPACT. The Supreme Courts decision\nmay open the window to refunds of taxes\npaid by employees on income imputed to\nemployees for same-sex married spouse\nand refunds of payroll taxes paid by em-\nployers on that income. FICA tax refund\nclaims by employers and employees for\nprior, open years may also be possible.\n\nCOMMENT. Some employers have at-\ntempted to equalize the treatment be-\ntween opposite-sex couples and same-sex\ncouples by providing so-called gross-ups\nto cover the additional taxes that same-\nsex couples pay on health benefits. Many\nemployers require an employee to certify\nthat a domestic partner qualifies as a de-\npendent under Code Sec. 152.\n\nCafeteria Plans. Employer contributions to\na cafeteria plan are usually made under a sal-\nary reduction agreement between the employer\nand the employee in which the employee agrees\nto contribute a portion of his or her salary on\na pre-tax basis to pay for the qualified benefits.\nSalary reduction contributions are not actually\nor constructively received by the participant.\nTherefore, those contributions are not consid-\nered wages for federal income tax purposes. In\naddition, those sums generally are not subject to\nFICA and FUTA taxes. However, pre-tax dol-\nlars could not be used to pay for coverage of a\nsame-sex spouse because of DOMA. This now\nshould change as a result of the Court's decision.\n\nHealth Flexible Spending Accounts. A\nhealth flexible spending arrangement (FSA)\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029311",
