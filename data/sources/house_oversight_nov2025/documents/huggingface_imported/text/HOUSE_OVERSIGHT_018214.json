  "text": "America becomes number two, we will still have a better world. In many\nways, the world is “converging” to American values and standards, as I\nexplain in The Great Convergence. The global middle class is booming,\ninterstate war 1s waning, and never before have people traveled and\ncommunicated across the world so easily. These changes are creating\ncommon values and norms across the world. Education and scientific\nreasoning, for example, are enabling people the world over to speak with a\ncommon language. However, while humanity is well on its way to\ncombating absolute poverty and interstate warfare, other problems are\nsurfacing. Preventing and curtailing transnational issues like climate\nchange, human and drug trafficking, and financial crises require\ncooperation among nation states, yet this is not happening. A simple\nanalogy illustrates this. Before the era of modern globalization,\nhumankind was like a flotilla of more than 100 separate boats in their\nseparate countries. The world needed a set of rules then to ensure that the\nmany boats did not collide and facilitate their cooperation on the high seas\nif they chose to do so. The 1945 rules-based order strived to do this, and\ndespite some obvious failures, it succeeded in producing a relatively stable\nglobal order for more than 50 years. Today, the 7 billion people who\ninhabit planet earth no longer live in more than 100 separate boats.\nInstead, they live in 193 separate cabins on the same boat. But this boat\nhas a problem. It has 193 captains and crews, each claiming exclusive\nresponsibility for one cabin. No captain or crew cares for the boat as a\nwhole. The world is now sailing into increasingly turbulent waters with no\ncaptain or crew at the helm. The Great Convergence echoes the themes\nof Clinton’s 2003 Yale speech. It’s in the interest of all — particularly great\npowers — to strengthen institutions of global governance so that we’re not\nsailing blindly into choppy waters without a captain. The National\nIntelligence Council recently projected that in 2030 Asia would overtake\nthe Western world economically, technologically and militarily. When\nChina becomes a world superpower in a matter of decades, the United\nStates and Europe will want to ensure that China plays by the rules.\n\nBut in order to make international organizations like the United Nations,\nthe IMF and the World Bank more credible and effective, they must\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018214",
