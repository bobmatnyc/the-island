So I go to a designer's cocktail party last night and Jonanthan and Kimberly Farkus are there telling me about your coming home
celebration and there might be on seat left on his cousin's plane....do you know about this?

I mentioned that you said there was no "release" party...

Iam coming if there is one- if you don't a "surprise" event- you might want to get into this.
Your friends are counting the days to freedom...

Went to Heyward Isham's funeral today...father of Ralph and Chris...very sad. Old wasp diplomat who was our Ambassador to
Haiti in 60's- sounds like CIA....is CIA

Going to dinner with Amy Irving, her husband and Mario Platero, a brilliant Italian G@ewish) journalist- very chic- wife in
Engand- he travels with Obama...runs big news agency here- very funny- you will love him- will introduce in your new life..

Cannes Diary finally went to press...

Was in LA for 3 days of meetings with every studio...working hard for the business...it's there, but it'a like begging to get them
to spend so we spend our days getting underwriting...thank God I have a guy in the office that does this...

Poured all day in Hamptons- sun just came out...

Miss you...
