I never saw Ghislaine Maxwell ona\n\n' she\n\nhelicopter with Bill Clinton. I never said that to you,\ndid none of that.\n\nSo your Honor, the last document, and it really, I\nthink, actually helps clarify the question your Honor raised\nwhen you came out to court this morning, is an email. It's an\nemail from Ghislaine Maxwell to Alan Dershowitz, January 6,\n2015, and it has a document attached called \"Four Press\nComplaints\".\n\nYour Honor will notice that this document is not\n\nmarked confidential, it was produced by Ms. Maxwell over a year\n\nago, it is marked Ghislaine Maxwell 0006, and it's a\n\ncommunication between herself and Alan Dershowitz, someone with\n\nwhom she does not have a joint defense agreement, and that's\nwhy she produced this email.\n\nYour Honor, this email, as you can tell from the date,\n\nwas sent four days after the allegedly defamatory statement at\nissue. It reflects Ms. Maxwell's dossier of all of the\n\nstatements from the papers that have been shown to be\n\ncompletely untrue or show inconsistency in her story. Each\n\narticle is listed so you can find that link that references th\n\nlies are inconsistencies.\n\nYour Honor, if you look at this document that was sent\n\njust a few days after the January 2nd email, and you turn to\n\npage 3, which is actually the attached document, \"Four Press\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011349",
