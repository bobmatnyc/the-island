Modern authoritarianism has\nsucceeded, where previous totalitarian systems failed, due to refined\nand nuanced strategies of repression, the exploitation of open\nsocieties, and the spread of illiberal policies in democratic countries\nthemselves. The leaders of today’s authoritarian systems devote full-\n\ntime attention to the challenge of crippling the opposition without\nannihilating it, and flouting the rule of law while maintaining a\nplausible veneer of order, legitimacy, and prosperity.\n\nCentral to the modern authoritarian strategy is the\ncapture of institutions that undergird political plural-\nism. The goal is to dominate not only the executive\nand legislative branches, but also the media, the\njudiciary, civil society, the commanding heights of the\neconomy, and the security forces. With these institu-\ntions under the effective if not absolute control of an\nincumbent leader, changes in government through fair\nand honest elections become all but impossible.\n\nUnlike Soviet-style communism, modern authoritari-\nanism is not animated by an overarching ideology or\nthe messianic notion of an ideal future society. Nor\ndo today's autocrats seek totalitarian control over\npeople's everyday lives, movements, or thoughts.\nThe media are more diverse and entertaining under\nmodern authoritarianism, civil society can enjoy an\n\nindependent existence (as long as it does not pursue\npolitical change), citizens can travel around the coun-\ntry or abroad with only occasional interference, and\nprivate enterprise can flourish (albeit with rampant\ncorruption and cronyism).\n\nThis study explains how modern authoritarianism de-\nfends and propagates itself, as regimes from different\nregions and with diverse socioeconomic foundations\ncopy and borrow techniques of political control.\nAmong its major findings:\n\n« Russia, under President Vladimir Putin, has\nplayed an outsized role in the development of\nmodern authoritarian systems. This is particu-\nlarly true in the areas of media control, propa-\nganda, the smothering of civil society, and the\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019235",
