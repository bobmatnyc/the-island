  "text": "swallowtail and butterfly buy back the smooth DE deterministic intuition lost with\ndiscontinuous changes in results.”\n\nHe grinned mischievously as he asked, “Can you see it?”\n\nThom’s catastrophes serve as accessible and powerful theoretical settings\nfor the use of energy as a generalizable, one dimensional, dependent, resulting\neffect, influenced by one or several, sometimes conflicting, independent, causal,\nvariables. For more examples: the weight of a ship (smaller to greater, left to right,\nalong the x, normal dimension) and the position of center of gravity (smaller to\ngreater, front to back, along the y splitting dimension) are causal with a jump in roof-\nheight energy from stability to capsizing, a discontinuity emerging from initially\nsmooth changes in stability. As above, gradually increasing tension (the left to right\nnormal factor) and alienation (the back to front (splitting factor) in inmates generate\na sudden increment in energy, from subtlety increasing tension in relative quiet to\nthe sudden outbreak in a riot in the prison population. Embryological notochord\nsomitogenesis, (that which become the vertebrate of the spinal column) has a\nsmooth (left to right) causal influence that Chris Zeeman named a normal factor. It\nis the smooth growth of the material wave of mesodermal (to become muscle,\nconnective tissue and bone) tissue. Zeeman called the front to back dimensional\ngradient of influence, the secondary wave of adhesiveness, the splitting factor. The\nvalue of this secondary wave co-determined a critical-valued interaction between\nthese causal parameters leading to a discontinuous change in the “energy”\nequivalent continuity of developmental growth and vertebral column segmentation.\n\nA little more technically: Thom’s basic mathematical contributions were in\ndifferential topology and analysis with particular emphasis on what is called\nstructural stability of surfaces representing and supporting actions called manifolds.\nFor example, in a graph of a function, say F(x), such that a change in cause x\ndetermines what happens to the result y= F(x), the stability question involves what\nhappens when one perturbs F(x) with a littles, i.e. 6 + F(x). Do the topological\nproperties of the surface representing the potential range of actions of the system\n(such as nearness of an originally close point set, continuity and connectedness of\n\nthe surface, its dimensionality, its compactness as a generalization of finiteness)\n\n56\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013556",
