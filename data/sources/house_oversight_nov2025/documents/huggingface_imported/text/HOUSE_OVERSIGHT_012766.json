  "text": "Chapter I:\nNature’s secrets\n\nNature hides her secrets because of her essential loftiness, but not by means of ruse.\n— Albert Einstein\n\nIn Charles Darwin’s day, biologists unearthed the mysteries of evolution by means of observation,\nsometimes accompanied by a simple experiment. This was largely a process of documenting the patterns\nof variation and uniformity that nature left behind. Only breeders were directly involved in manipulating\nthese patterns, using artificial selection to alter the size, shape, coloration, and lifespan of plants and\nanimals.\n\nThe Darwins of today continue this tradition, but with new tools, informed by understanding of\nthe genetic code and aided by technical developments in engineering, physics, chemistry, and computer\nscience. These tools allow for deeper penetration into the sources of change, and the causes of\nevolutionary similarities and differences. They also enable biologists to change the course of evolution\nand the patterns of development by turning genes off or turning novel ones on, and even creating\nsynthetic organisms in test tubes — a wonderful playground for understanding both questions of origin,\nchange, and extinction.\n\nThe Darwins of today are cowboys, trailblazing a new frontier of understanding. But like the\nfrontier of the early American wild west, nature holds many secrets and surprises. Sometimes when we\nbreak through nature’s guard, we gain fundamental truths about the living world, knowledge that can be\nharnessed to improve animal and human welfare. But sometimes when we break through, we create toxic\nconsequences and ethical dilemmas. Tampering with nature is risky business as there are many hidden\nand unforeseen consequences.\n\nIn 1999, the molecular biologist Joe Tsien and his team at Princeton University tampered with\nmother nature. Their discovery, published in a distinguished scientific journal, soon filled the\nnewspapers, radio airwaves, and even a spot on Dave Letterman’s late night television show. Tsien\n\nmanipulated a gene that was known to influence memory, causing it to work over time. This created a\n\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012766",
