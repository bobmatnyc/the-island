People paid their taxes and went\nabout their lives normally; only the traffic behavior was affected.\n\nAfghanistan has had most of its social structures removed over the\nlast forty or so years. First the Soviets, and then the Taliban, took apart\nmuch of the fabric until finally the Allied Forces swept the Taliban out,\nleaving very little behind. There were no police or courts, and few laws\n\n— or at least none enforced by the rule of law. The Allied Forces have\nspent a decade rebuilding these structures. Before we examine Masters’\npresentation, let’s look at the daily life of an Afghan farmer.\n\nIf you are an Afghan farmer you have a dilemma. Your most reliable\ncrop is opium. It grows well in the arid soil, does not require irrigation, and\nis resistant to most pests. For this crop there is a financial infrastructure\nto rival the Chicago Commodities Exchange. You get interest free loans\nsecured against the crop, and you can forward sell your product on a\nfutures market. Your investors can ‘add value’ by dealing with the major\npest — the US military. They do this through the simple expedience of\ntaking pot shots at them if they get too close to the crop. Since a field of\nopium is worth $30,000 and a militia wage for the year is $350, you can\neasily employ a few men to protect your investment. Of course, you are\nindebted to thugs and criminals, but they are at least reliable thugs and\ncriminals.\n\nOn the other hand, the traditional products of the Himalayas -\nwalnuts, pomegranates and vines — need years to cultivate. There is no\nforward market and the timescales over which you must take risks are\nfar greater. If you believe your American protectors will leave before the\ncrops mature, you will be loath to plant and care for them. But, if you\nmake the decision to take this risk, you have a strong incentive to foster\nstability and reap the rewards of your effort. There is a feedback effect:\nthe balance of power between all the different parties is important to the\ndecisions you make, and the decisions you make affect your desire to\ninvest in future stability.\n\nMasters’ team built a slide pack to demonstrate the complex\ninteractions between the groups: farmers, security, stability, markets,\nmilitary power, and emerging institutions. The COIN - COunter\nINsurgency — dynamics slide shows just how hard it is to communicate\ncomplex topics between human beings. The presentation is beautifully\ncrafted but it was a public relations disaster. At the end of the presentation\nGeneral McChrystal said jokingly, “When we understand that slide, we\nwill have won the war.” The slide was paraded in the press as, “the most\ncomplicated PowerPoint slide in history.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015745",
