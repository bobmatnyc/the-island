  "text": "How did they get by? They used the easy credit of the banking system, thereby feeding the frenzy that ended in bad\nloans and meltdown.\n\nKeating's book has an abiding message for Australia: in the transformed world we \"will find ourselves increasingly\non our own\" having to master our own destiny.\n\nThe job is to rediscover the productivity and savings agenda of the 1990s. Why did Australia survive the 2008\nfinancial crisis? \"Because of the flexibility of the economy,\" Keating says. \"Flexibility which came from the reform of\nAustralia's financial, product and labour markets that began 25 years ago. This has given us one of the most flexible\neconomies in the world - arguably the most flexible. But further structural changes are ahead of us.”\n\nHe lists them. It is a mix of the new and old Keating agenda: a shift in resources to the extractive industries; a lift in\ncapital inflow driving a high current account deficit putting a premium on savings; recognition that competitiveness\nwill lie \"in the creativity of our people as much as it does in our oil and gas\"; a renewed emphasis on the value of hi-\ntech and education; and above all, a cultural change that integrates Australia more into East Asia. “Cultural\ntransformation is the key for us,\" Keating says. He rates it as more important than economic reform.\n\n“There is less interest now in being part of East Asia than there was in the 1990s,\" he laments.\n\nKeating wants this idea revived. And he ties it to the republic arguing that to succeed in Asia we must become a\nrepublic, a proposition Howard always dismissed.\n\nOn China, Keating is an optimist yet alive to the daunting economic challenge China now confronts. \"What is\nhappening in China knows no precedence in world economic history,\" he says. \"Never before have 1.25 billion\npeople dragged themselves from poverty at such a pace. China is now half the GDP of the US and incomes have\nrisen by a factor of 10.\" He argues, however, that the origin of the 2008 financial crisis lies in the global imbalances -\nChina has built huge foreign exchange reserves by exporting too much and America, in turn, is saving too little.\n\nKeating says: \"China must shift the basis of growth from net exports and investment to domestic consumption. Will\nthey achieve this? Probably. Will there be strains along the way? There have to be.\"\n\nUnlike many Australian leaders, Keating is a Europhile. \"I think the European project is the most significant project\nsince the second world war,\" he says. But he sees two huge blunders made in Europe.\n\nFrom the euro's inception, Keating said it should constitute only Germany, France and the Benelux nations, not the\nperipheral countries around the Mediterranean, and \"Greece should never have been allowed in\".\n\nWhy were the weaker economies given entry?\n\nKeating says: \"It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't ready to sit beside the\nGerman unified state without some friends.\"\n\nSo the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: \"The problem is we have a single\ncurrency without a political union and without a fiscal union.\"\n\nThe second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For Keating, this was recklessness\nfor which the world may yet pay.\n\n\"Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order,\" he says. \"But that didn't happen.\nSo Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian nationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nWho is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton.\n\nOn the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan must bear \"a fair amount of\nresponsibility”.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029556",
