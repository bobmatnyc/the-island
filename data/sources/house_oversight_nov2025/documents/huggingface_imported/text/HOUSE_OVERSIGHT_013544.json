  "text": "for my most rebellious post-doctoral student. | would tell my teen-age son that he\nmust wait another year for his own car. | felt generally intolerant.\n\nIn an article in Runners World, | labeled my run’s first global brain state\ntransition, the first second wind. |t energized me with the cool firmness but ready-to-\nbe angry righteousness of modern religious orthodoxy: Orthodox Jews gunning\ndown Hamas terrorists as retribution for bus bombing children which was itself a\nretribution; Muslim suicide bombing as vengeance for cultural contamination;\nCatholic Bishops refusing the Eucharist to pro-choice politicians; Charismatic\nChristians gay bashing defense of the sanctity of marriage; Mohammed’s early Sufi-\nlike poetry of love turning into territorial aggression and Jew killing in his later years.\n\nOnce in while, unpredictably, past the first hour of running and after the first\nsecond wind, a fatigue easing second burst of energy followed the second stage of\nexhaustion. | called this running-induced, second global brain state transition to a\nsofter loving energy, the second second wind. Colors became intense, clouds\nbreathed and my body lightened. Running once again became easy. | was flooded\nwith empathic and generous thoughts. | understood that the Dean was faced with\ntoo many space demands to satisfy; the grant reviewers’ criticisms of the budget\nwere meant to be constructive. | recalled that strong minded, rebellious post-\ndoctoral students often made the most creative contributions to science. | realized\nthat my son’s urgent desire for his own car was a proposal in the direction of the\nindependence that would be required of him the following year when he was going\nto be hundreds of miles away at a university. Filled with benign optimism, | felt the\ncompassionate perspective afforded those with energy but without envy, anger or\nfear. William James, in Varieties of Religious Experience, A.C. Underwood’s book,\nConversion, Christian and Non-Christian and Gobi Krishna’s The Awakening of the\nKundalini, among many others before and since, describe the sudden appearance\nof long lasting states of optimistic energy and loving empathy that can emerge after\nlong episodes of suffering, especially following periods of privation of spiritual\nmeaning and the loss of a previously strong faith. These episodes are painfully\nchronicled by St. John of the Cross in his Dark Night of the Soul.\n\n44\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013544",
