  "text": "RLK: Well certainly it’s a concern, but I would call ita\nminor annoyance as opposed to something extremely\nserious. They have a lot on their plate here. The last\nthing they want is a trade war with the U.S., but they\nhave to react. If the U.S. does something, there has to be\nsomething that they will do in retaliation. They will\nratchet it down. They will signal, as you do, that they do\nnot want to accelerate this, but to save face and to be\nappropriate, they'll have to match it.\n\nHOST: To you Minxin Pei, how do you see this playing\nout?\n\nMP: If the investigations find China at fault, or guilty of\nsome practices, then the US has a wide range of options\nto punish China ona trade front. And if these things\nhappen, then US-China trade war will take place.\nAnother thing I want to say is that US-China relations\nhave turned a corner. This is a relationship that has\nheaded toward a long period of confrontation, and\nadversarial relationships. So what is going to happen\non the trade front is part of a much larger picture of\ngeopolitical rivalry, if not competition.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023677",
