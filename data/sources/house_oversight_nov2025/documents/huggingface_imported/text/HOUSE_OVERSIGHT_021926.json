And so Brunel's deposition is set and then he -- he\nfinagles out of it, too. I don't recall exactly what\nhis excuse was, but, you know, evaded the deposition and\nin fact, later information came to light he was hiding\nout in the mansion of Epstein while he's claiming he's\nunavailable for deposition.\n\nSo -- so this pattern of Mr. Dershowitz, you\nknow, there were three attempts to obtain information\nfrom him, if that's all I had, I guess that would have\nbeen one thing. But what I had was a pattern of people\nwho were implicated in the sex trafficking ring evading\nquestions, you know, quite in violation of court orders\nand depositions and things -- I shouldn't say court\norders -- in violation of the deposition notices that\nwere being sent and agreements being made through\ncounsel .\n\nAnd then in addition to that, I had this, so\nwhy -- why would you think that there's this sex\ntrafficking, you know, ring going on? It sounds kind of\nfarfetched. Well, one of the things that I had\navailable to me on December 30th was a photograph that\nwas widely available on the Internet, and that\n\nphotograph depicted three people.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021926",
