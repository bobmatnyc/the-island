  "text": "Schrédinger’s Cat\n\neasurement is a big puzzle. What causes the collapse of the\nMees function so that the photon stops considering many\n\noptional paths and makes a hard and fast decision. When light\npasses through a series of glass surfaces, it is reflected or transmitted by\neach. We can stack up as many pieces of glass as we want, but none of the\nsurfaces will cause a measurement — a collapse of the wave function. It is\nnot until the photon reaches a detector that a measurement is made and\nall the potential reflections and transmissions that might have happened\n‘collapse’ into the one choice that actually happened.\n\nYou might doubt this but there are ingenious experiments that can\nbe performed to prove it. One is quite simple to do and can be set up\non your kitchen table with a handheld laser and $100 worth of optical\ncomponents. You need three ordinary mirrors and a beam splitter. Beam\nsplitters are often made from half-silvered mirrors. They are similar to\nyour bedroom mirror except the silver coating is more thinly applied,\nallowing only half the light to reflect while the rest passes straight\nthrough. Arrange the mirrors and beam splitter on a table at the four\ncorners of an imaginary box, as in the diagram. If you point your laser at\nthe half-silvered mirror, half the light will go straight through and half\nwill be reflected upwards towards the first mirror. It is sent on around the\nsquare until it meets the half-silvered mirror again, and the beams meet\nup. You might expect that half the light reaches the detector but this is\nnot what happens. Depending on the way the mirrors are positioned,\neither all the light reaches the detector, or none does. (The light does not\ndisappear it just gets sent back to the light source, energy is conserved.)\nIf you turn down the brightness of your laser, this does not change. Even\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016015",
