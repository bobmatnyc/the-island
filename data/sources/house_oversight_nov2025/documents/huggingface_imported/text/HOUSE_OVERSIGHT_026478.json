  "text": "inspector general, unearthed a pattern of anti-Trump bias by high-ranking officials at the Federal\nBureau of Investigation. Some of their communications, the report says, were “not only indicative of a\nbiased state of mind but imply a willingness to take action to impact a presidential candidate’s\nelectoral prospects.” Although Mr. Horowitz could not definitively ascertain whether this bias\n“directly affected” specific FBI actions in the Hillary Clinton email investigation, it nonetheless\n\naffects the legality of the Trump-Russia collusion inquiry, code-named Crossfire Hurricane.\n\nCrossfire was launched only months before the 2016 election. Its FBI progenitors—the same ones\nwho had investigated Mrs. Clinton—deployed at least one informant to probe Trump campaign\nadvisers, obtained Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court wiretap warrants, issued national security\nletters to gather records, and unmasked the identities of campaign officials who were surveilled. They\n\nalso repeatedly leaked investigative information.\n\nMr. Horowitz is separately scrutinizing Crossfire and isn’t expected to finish for months. But the\ncurrent report reveals that FBI officials displayed not merely an appearance of bias against Donald\nTrump, but animus bordering on hatred. Peter Strzok, who led both the Clinton and Trump\ninvestigations, confidently assuaged a colleague’s fear that Mr. Trump would become president: “No\nhe won’t. We’ll stop it.” An unnamed FBI lawyer assigned to Crossfire told a colleague he was\n“devastated” and “numb” after Mr. Trump won, while declaring to another FBI attorney: “Viva le\n\nresistance.”\n\nThe report highlights the FBI’s failure to act promptly upon discovering that Anthony Weiner’s laptop\ncontained thousands of Mrs. Clinton’s emails. Investigators justified the delay by citing the “higher\npriority” of Crossfire. But Mr. Horowitz writes: “We did not have confidence that Strzok’s decision to\nprioritize the Russia investigation over following up on [the] investigative lead discovered on the\n\nWeiner laptop was free from bias.”\n\nSimilarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying\nto influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the\ninspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was\n\nmotivated by a desire to protect her assumed presidency’s legitimacy.\n\nThe inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok’s text messages “‘created the appearance that investigative\ndecisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.” The report adds, importantly, that “most\nof the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation.” Given how biases\nineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton\n\ninvestigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026478",
