  "text": "Sarah Silverman on 'The Last Laugh’\n\nCassandra Church/Starburns Audio\n\n“I can only just be honest and say, if I didn’t know Al Franken, I’d probably be like yeah, go girl, me\ntoo, fuck that shit. Because I do know him, I don’t feel that way. So maybe I’m too close to it and just\nseeing the dots not the big picture. But I just can’t believe it. The U.S.O. thing is bullshit and if you\nwatch the sketch they did, give me a fucking break. He may be guilty of doing pedestrian comedy, I\nguess, but he apologized and she accepted his apology. But it does seem that the Republican Party—\nand I don’t think this is something to emulate at all—doesn’t apologize, denies everything, admits\nnothing and everyone keeps their job. And I hate that that’s what we teach our children. But if you\napologize and say, ‘I want there to be an ethics investigation on me and I want to do everything by the\nbook, this is my truth but I’m open to [the fact] that these women felt this way, I want to make this\nright,’ I don’t know why that person then loses their job.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031781",
