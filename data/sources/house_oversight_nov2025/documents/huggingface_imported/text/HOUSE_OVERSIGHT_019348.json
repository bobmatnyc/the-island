Objective: an alliance between \nright-wing leaders, from Salvini to Orban in view of the 2019 elections \nNEW YORK. The invasion of Europe has begun. Steve Bannon, 65, the American far-right guru who \nwas Donald Trump's right-hand man in the White House — but let go last summer following the racist \nviolence in Charlottesville — is preparing to march on Brussels. Launching, he told the Daily Beast \nhimself, a new non-profit foundation called The Movement, (II Movimento), right in the heart of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019348 \nEurope and its institutions. Through which he hopes to coordinate the populist right in view of the \nEuropean elections which will be held in spring 2019. \nObjective: to compete with George Soros, the American billionaire of Hungarian origin, benefactor of \nthe Democratic party, who since 1984 with his Open Society has spent at least $32 billion in support of \nNGOs dealing with human rights. And for this he became the bogeyman of the populist right, accused \nof plots of all kinds: including that of wanting to replace Italians with immigrants in order to have \nlabour at low cost. A mantra repeated in the past on Twitter also by the current Minister of the Interior \nMatteo Salvini. \nThe ambition of Steve Bannon, former director of the alt-right American site Breitbart — which in the \nEuropean campaign preceded him since the platform had already opened bureaux in London and \nRome — is therefore to become the coordinator of the one great \"populist international\" of which he \nhas long since been dreaming. \nThe Movement, in fact, intends to function as an extreme right-wing think tank: a source of strategic \nadvice to channel the not-so-politically structured discontent of the most extreme European \nmovements. Analysing data and giving strategic advice. But also by raising funds and channeling \nfunding. \nThe aim is to create a populist alliance, a sort of \"super group\" that if victorious can conquer up to a \nthird of the European Parliament in the elections next May. \nIndeed — putting the common policy of the Old Continent in the hands of Bannon and his own. The \nAmerican strategist is very attached to the Freedom Caucus — the extreme right of the US Congress \n— and in 2014 he was at the top of the Cambridge Analytica company, which in 2016 used data stolen \nfrom Facebook to try to influence the presidential election from which Donald Trump emerged victor. \nIt is not a mystery that for a long time he courts nationalists of the right from East to West. And he has \nalready met, among others, the Hungarian Orban, the French Marine Le Pen and the former leader of \nthe British separatists Nigel Farage. The latter reappeared, coincidentally, on Friday in Pennsylvania, \nUSA, to a fundraiser in favor of the Republican congressman Lou Barletta. Without forgetting the \nItalians of Lega and 5 stars. Of them, he said: \"If it works in Italy, we can import the model \nanywhere\". \nThe Movement, which for now will count on a staff of 10 people, will be fully operational in 2019. In \nshort, after the American midterm elections, where Bannon is fighting to influence the primaries \nsupporting candidates potentially able to undermine the prospects of Republican establishment. But in \nthe future the former spin doctor says he wants to spend more and more time in Europe. Also because \nthe relationships with Trump have worsened after the revelations he made to Michael Wolff and \npublished in the scandal book \"Fire and Fury\". \"Better to reign in Hell than to serve in Paradise,\" \nBannon says now paraphrasing the Satan of one of his favorite books, John Milton's Lost Paradise. \nHell in this case would be the dear old Europe and its democratic values. The \"army of darkness\" is \nalready among us. \nIn Sacratissimo Corde Iesu et Purissimo Corde Mariae et Castissimo Corde Ioseph. \n******* \nBenjamin Harnwell \nFounder and President of the Board of Trustees \nDignitatis Humanae Institute \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 019349 \nCell: \nOffice: \nIstituto Dignitatis Humanae \n44 Via delle Fornaci  \nRoma 00165  \nITALY  \n@ben harnwell \nwww.dignitatishumanae.corn \nII giorno 22 lug 2018, alle ore 15:38, Steve Bannon < > ha scritto: \nWhat does this say??? \nBegin forwarded message: \nFrom: Maria Luisa <____________________ \nDate: July 22, 2018 at 9:11:58 AM EDT \nTo: Steve Bannon <11111, Preate Alexandra < \n<PHOTO-2018-07-22-10-02-17.jpg> \nSent from my iPhone \nk \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
