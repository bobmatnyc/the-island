At that point, if the Russians or Chinese had any doubts how dissatisfied he was\nwith the NSA, they would be dispelled by the video. Since dissatisfaction is one of the classic\nmeans of recruitment in the intelligence business, he certainly would become a prime target for\nrecruitment after he went public. The CIA also considered the possibility that Snowden also\nmay have been reeled in unwittingly. Its Deputy Director, Michael Morell suggested in his book\nthat Snowden may not himself have fully realized “when and how he would be used.”\n\nWhat can be safely assumed is that the decision made by Putin’s intelligence service to allow\nSnowden to proceed to Russia proceeded from something other than soft-hearted sentiment about\nhis welfare. In addition, this decision was not made on the spur of the moment. After Putin\nlearned that there was an American in Hong Kong from the “special services” seeking to come to\nRussia, he also learned from Snowden’s own disclosure on the video that he had taken to Hong\nKong a large number of NSA documents. After that self-outing by Snowden, Putin had at least 14\ndays to calculate the advantages and disadvantages of allowing him to come to Moscow. To be\nsure, we don’t know the precise date of Snowden’s first contact with Russian officials in Hong\nKong. Putin reframed from specifying when Snowden first met them. But whenever it was, we\nknow that he was deemed important enough by the Russian intelligence service for it to bring him\nto the personal attention of Putin.\n\nPutin could offer him not only his freedom from arrest but a platform to express his views.\nThe exploitation of an intelligence defector, even after he yields his secrets documents, can also\nbe part of an intelligence operation. General Alexander, who ran the NSA during this period,\nconcluded that Putin was playing a deep game with Snowden by “looking to capitalize on the fact\nthat his [Snowden’s] actions are enormously disruptive and damaging to US interests.” This\ngame, if Alexander’s assessment in correct, might provide Putin with ample reason to have his\nrepresentatives in Hong Kong offer Snowden an exfiltration deal.\n\nSnowden hardly was not in any position to refuse such a deal. After the release of the video\nrelease, there was no going back to America without his facing a determined criminal prosecution.\nIf he had researched the issue, he would have known that in every prior case, intelligence\nworkers who had released even a single classified document had gone to prison. As his Internet\npostings show, he had closely followed the ordeal of Bradley Manning, whose trial was coming to\nits conclusion while Snowden was in Hong Kong. So he likely knew that even though the\ndocuments Manning had sent to Wikileaks were far less damaging than those Snowden had taken.\nManning had been kept in solitary confinement under horrific conditions for over a year while\nawaiting his trial and was facing a long prison sentence. (Manning was subsequently sentenced to\n35 years in prison.) There was no reason for Snowden to expect a better outcome for himself if\nhe returned to the US or was arrested in Hong Kong or any other place that had an extradition\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020282",
