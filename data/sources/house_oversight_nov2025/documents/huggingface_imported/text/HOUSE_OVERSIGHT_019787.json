  "text": "Epilogue\nThe Snowden Effect\n\nGovernments can reduce our dignity to something like that of\ntagged animals.\n\n—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2016\n\nHE ENORMOUS EFFECT that Snowden has had on America can\n\nbe divided into three categories: the good, the bad, and the ugly.\nThe good proceeds from the national conversation on the issue of\nsurveillance in 2013 that his disclosures ignited. There is no denying\nthat Snowden’s dramatic disclosures, despite the damage they did to\nU.S. intelligence, accomplished a salutary service in alerting both the\npublic and the government to the potential danger of a surveillance\nleviathan. The steady expansion of the NSA‘s collection of telephone\nbilling records under the cloak of secrecy, for example, revealed a\nbureaucratic mission creep that badly needed to be brought under\ncloser oversight by Congress. Snowden’s breach provided another\nbenefit. It pointed to the security dangers proceeding from the NSA’s\nheadlong rush to outsource its computer servicing to private con-\ntractors. Opening this back door, as Snowden amply demonstrated,\ngreatly increased the risk that America’s secrets would fall into the\nhands of its enemies. An intelligence service has little if any value if\nit cannot keep secret its sources from its adversaries.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 299 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019787",
