Dear Ian —
You are invited to join us at Dialog 2014 -- a two-day bipartisan retreat discussing how to change the world.
You were nominated for Dialog by Chamath Palihapitiya.

There will be no speeches ... just many moderated break-out discussions of 6-15 people on various topics. And we
design the agenda around your ideas and needs.

Please let us know if you would like to join us,
- Peter Thiel and Auren Hoffman

p.s. and yes, we know Dialog 2014 is 16 months away, but we are giving you a chance to sign up now

DETAILS:

You're invited to join us at the Dialog Retreat ... 150 people to change the world ... a participatory and entrepreneurial
conversation on changing the world.

The Dialog participants aren’t modest. We want to change the world.

But we don’t want to spend our time being in a large audience listening to winded speeches. There are no speakers. No
panels. All attendees participate in break-out facilitated discussions. And we limit the discussion to only 150 global
leaders who can have an impact now and emerging leaders who can help implement the plans we develop.

Dates: March 13-15, 2014
Location: Sundance Resort, Utah (40 minutes from the Salt Lake City airport)
We've rented out the entire resort
