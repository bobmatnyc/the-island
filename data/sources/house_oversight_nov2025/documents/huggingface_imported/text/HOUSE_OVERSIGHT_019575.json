Poitras, who would be accompanying them, would be\npaying her own way.\n\nIn case The Guardian failed to publish the story, Snowden had a\ncontingency plan in place. While Greenwald was negotiating with\nGibson, Snowden arranged for Micah Lee, Poitras’s associate at the\nFreedom of the Press Foundation, to build a personal website for\nhim. Writing to Lee from Hong Kong, first under his alias Anon108\nand later under his real name, Snowden said that he planned to post\nhis “anti-surveillance manifesto.” He would also use it to post “a\nglobal petition against surveillance.” Snowden had Lee name the site\n“SupportOnlineRights.com.” According to Lee, the website would\nbe built with a “dead man’s switch,” which would automatically\ntrigger the release of NSA documents if Snowden was arrested.

In the security of his unknown\nresidence in Hong Kong, he also worked to carefully separate the\npurloined NSA documents into two very different caches. “I care-\nfully evaluated every single document I disclosed,” Snowden\nexplained to the Guardian journalists in early June. The documents\nin this first cache were selected to serve what he termed the “pub-\nlic interest.” In the hands of journalists, these selected documents,\nand the story he fashioned to accompany them, would burnish his\nimage in the public consciousness as a whistle-blower. He did not\nturn over the second cache, telling Greenwald, “There are all sorts\nof documents that would have made a big impact that I didn’t turn\nover.”\n\nBy the time he received the message from Poitras, Snowden had\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 87 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019575",
