The focal interest is the\nstruggle against radical Islamic\nterrorism and against Iran's hegemonic\nand nuclear intentions.\n\n¢ The challenge for us is based on\nthere being, apparently, only one way\nto achieve that; and the upcoming\nelections in Israel force us to put it on\nhold for a few months.\n\n¢ And the way to do it is this: a\nstrong, self-confident Israel, willing to\nhold serious negotiations with the\nPalestinians and the group of Arab\nnations within an international\nconference, backed by the US and the\nQuartet — in order to achieve a two-\nstate solution and establish a regional\nagreement, while maintaining an\nunyielding and persistent fight against\nterrorism and ensuring the IDF's\nqualitative military edge over any\ncombination of opponents.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028912",
