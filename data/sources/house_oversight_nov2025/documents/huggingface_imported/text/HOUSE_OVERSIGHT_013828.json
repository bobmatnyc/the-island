  "text": "If you were fired from your job today, what would you do to get things under financial\ncontrol? Imagine this scenario and run through questions 1-3 above. If you quit your job to test\nother options, how could you later get back on the same career track if you absolutely had to?\n\nWhat are you putting off out of fear? Usually, what we most fear doing is what we most need to\ndo. That phone call, that conversation, whatever the action might be—it is fear of unknown\noutcomes that prevents us from doing what we need to do. Define the worst case, accept it, and do\nit. Pll repeat something you might consider tattooing on your forehead: What we fear doing most is\nusually what we most need to do. As I have heard said, a person’s success in life can usually be\nmeasured by the number of uncomfortable conversations he or she is willing to have. Resolve to\ndo one thing every day that you fear. I got into this habit by attempting to contact celebrities and\nfamous businesspeople for advice.\n\nWhat is it costing you—financially, emotionally, and physically—to postpone action? Don’t\nonly evaluate the potential downside of action. It is equally important to measure the atrocious cost\nof inaction. If you don’t pursue those things that excite you, where will you be in one year, five\nyears, and ten years? How will you feel having allowed circumstance to impose itself upon you\nand having allowed ten more years of your finite life to pass doing what you know will not fulfill\nyou? If you telescope out 10 years and know with 100% certainty that it is a path of\ndisappointment and regret, and if we define risk as “the likelihood of an irreversible negative\noutcome,” inaction is the greatest risk of all.\n\nWhat are you waiting for? If you cannot answer this without resorting to the previously rejected\nconcept of good timing, the answer is simple: You’re afraid, just like the rest of the world.\nMeasure the cost of inaction, realize the unlikelihood and re-pairability of most missteps, and\ndevelop the most important habit of those who excel and enjoy doing so: action.\n\n5. www.nexussurf.com\n\n6. This turned out to be yet another self-imposed limitation and false construct. BrainQUICKEN was\nacquired by a private equity firm in 2009. The process is described on www.fourhourblog.com.\n\n7. http://www .tpLorg/tier3 cd.cim?content item id=5307&folder_id=1545.\n\nSystem Reset\n\n>» BEING UNREASONABLE AND UNAMBIGUOUS\n\n“Would you tell me, please, which way I ought to go from here?”\n“That depends a good deal on where you want to get to,” said the Cat.\n\n“T don’t much care where ...” said Alice.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013828",
