SCAROLA:\nQ. -- that's a young woman.\nMR. SCOTT: Objection. You're cutting the\nwitness off. You're not letting him finish.\nA. This looks like a picture out of a Playboy\nor Penthouse magazine. It does not look to me like\na person who is under the age of 16 or 17 or 18.\nBut I don't think you can tell anything from the\npicture. I think you can tell much more from\nmeeting somebody and being with them and having a\nconversation with them.\nMR. SCAROLA: Let's mark this photograph,\nif we could, as Exhibit Number 4.\n(Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff\nExhibit 4.)\nBY MR. SCAROLA: .\nQ. Does Exhibit Number 4 help you at all to\nrecognize this young woman?\nA. I've never -- | have no -- no recollection\n\nof this young woman at all.\n\nQ. Allright. Would you describe for us,\nplease, the Tatiana that you flew with Jeffrey\nEpstein on November 17, 2005?\n\nA. First, | want to emphasize that that's\nthree years later than any of the issues involved in\n\nto OWN HA mH BW NN\n\nNNNNNN PF EP Be Be Be eH Oe\nmF WwW NHN FF CO ODO Oo WH HH FP WwW NHN HF OO\n\n198\n\nthis case. | have no recollection of flying with\n\nthis woman. | saw the name Tatiana on a manifest.\nAnd my recoliection of Tatiana -- | have\n\nno recollection of flying with her, but my\n\nrecollection of Tatiana is that she was a serious,\n\nmid 20s woman friend of Jeffrey Epstein, who I may\n\nhave met on one or two or three occasions when he\n\nwas with her in -- perhaps at Harvard University\n\nwhere he was meeting with academics and scholars, or\n\nperhaps -- I think that's probably the context\n\nwhere -- where she might have been.\n\nQ. But you never flew with her?\n\nA. Thave no recollection of flying with her.\n\nQ. Okay. Well, let me sec if this helps to\nrefresh your recollection, Mr. Dershowitz.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Let's mark this as Exhibit\n\nNumber 5, please.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Uh-huh, yes.\n(Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff\nExhibit 5.)\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. De you see that the name of the woman in\nthe photographs I have handed you is Tatiana\nKovylina, K-O-V-Y-L-I-N-A, a Victoria Secrets model?\n\nThe photographs, sir, look at the\n\now nmnn nm P&P WN\n\n199\n\nphotographs. The photographs identify the woman as\nTatiana Kovylina, correct?\nA. Yes, but --\nMR. SCOTT: Mr. Dershowitz, take your\ntime --\nTHE WITNESS: Yeah.\nMR. SCOTT: -- review the exhibits. Don't\nbe rushed by Mr. Scarola.\nA. Yes, it's a different -- different\nspelling of the name. The Tatiana on the manifest\nis spelled T-A-I-T-A-N-N-A.\nThe Tatiana in the photograph is\nT-A-T-I-N -- LA-N-A. I have no idea whether --\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\nQ. The last name --\nA. -- they are the same person.\nQ. -- is the same, Kovylina, right?\nA. There's no last name.\nQ. Well, read down a little bit further, if\nyou would, Mr. Dershowitz.\nA. You mean as toa different flight?\nQ. Yes, sir. Identifying the return flight\nfor the same Tatiana.\nA. [have no idea that it's a return flight.\nI have nothing on the record that suggests that it's\n\n200\n\nareturn flight. And it has different people on it.\nSo I have no reason to believe it's a return flight.\n\nQ. Is the last -- the question that I asked\nyou, Mr. Dershowitz, is: Is the last name spelled\nexactly the same as the last name is spelled in the\ntwo photographs I have shown you?\n\nA. Let me look. So, on the 20th of\nNovember --\n\nQ. Is the last name --\n\nMR. SCOTT: Whoa, whoa --\nBY MR. SCAROLA:\n\nQ. -- spelled the same way on both the flight\nlog and the two photographs I have shown you?\nA. On-- you mean on a flight log that I was\nnot on the flight? Is that right? You're talking\n\nabout a flight log that I was not on the flight,\nright?\n\nQ. That flight log shows you on multiple\nflights, does it not?\n\nA. It shows me not on that flight. It shows\nme on a number of flights, but not on that flight.\n\nMR. SCOTT: What's the date of the\nflights?\n\nTHE WITNESS: The date of that flight\nis -- looks like November 20th, 2005, more\n\n6 (Pages 197 to 200)\n\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888) 811-3408\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010788",
