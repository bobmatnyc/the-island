  "text": "personality headliner was slated to be the alt-right figure Milo Yiannopoulos, a gay British\nright-wing provocateur attached to Breitbart News. Yiannopoulos—whose entire position,\nrather more like a circa-1968 left-wing provocateur, seemed to be about flouting political\ncorrectness and social convention, resulting in left-wing hysteria and protests against him\n—was as confounding a conservative figure as could be imagined. Indeed, there was a\nsubtle suggestion that CPAC had chosen Yiannopoulos precisely to hoist Bannon and the\nWhite House on the implicit connection to him—yYiannopoulos had been something of a\nBannon protégé. When, two days before CPAC opened, a conservative blogger discovered\na video of Yiannopoulos in bizarre revelry seeming to rationalize pedophilia, the White\nHouse made it clear he had to go.\n\nStill, the White House presence at CPAC—which included, along with the president,\nBannon, Conway, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and the oddball White House foreign\npolicy adviser and former Breitbart writer Sebastian Gorka—seemed to push the\nYiannopoulos mess to the side. If CPAC was always looking to leaven boring politicians\nwith star power, Trump, and anyone connected him, were now the biggest stars. With her\nfamily positioned out in front of a full house, Conway was interviewed in Oprah-like style\nby Mercedes Schlapp (wife of Matt Schlapp—CPAC was a family affair), a columnist for\nthe conservative Washington Times who would later join the White House\ncommunications staff. It was an intimate and inspirational view of a woman of high\nachievement, the kind of interview that Conway believed she would have been treated to\non network and cable television if she were not a Trump Republican—the type of\ntreatment, she’d point out, that had been given to Democratic predecessors like Valerie\nJarrett.\n\nAt about the time that Conway was explaining her particular brand of antifeminist\nfeminism, Richard Spencer arrived at the convention center hoping to attend the breakout\nsession “The Alt-Right Ain’t Right at All,” a modest effort to reaffirm CPAC’s traditional\nvalues. Spencer, who since the Trump victory had committed himself to full-time activism\nand press opportunities, had planned to position himself to get in the first question. But\nalmost immediately upon arriving and paying his $150 registration fee, he had attracted\nfirst one reporter and then a growing circle, a spontaneous press scrum, and he responded\nby giving an ad hoc news conference. Like Yiannopoulos, and in many ways like Trump\nand Bannon, Spencer helped frame the ironies of the modern conservative movement. He\nwas a racist but hardly a conservative—he doggedly supported single-payer health care,\nfor instance. And the attention he received was somehow less a credit to conservatism than\nanother effort by the liberal media to smear conservatism. Hence, as the scrum around him\nincreased to as many as thirty people, the CPAC irony police stepped in.\n\n“You're not welcome on the property,” announced one of the security guards. “They\nwant you off the property. They want you to cease. They want you off the property.”\n\n“Wow,” said Spencer. “Can they?”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019981",
