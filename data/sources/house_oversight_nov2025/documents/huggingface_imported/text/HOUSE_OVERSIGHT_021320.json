  "text": "Systems and Signals for Social\nCoordination\n\nHow do we understand each other\nas people? Do we take people at their\nword, or do actions speak even louder?\nWhen moved to affiliate and to act in\nconcert with other people as a group, we\nneed to understand the communications\nand actions of others. Language can\nmove us to action even across great\ndistances but how does it do so? While\nwe can observe the behavior of groups\n\nof people as coordinated, the mechanism\n\nof achieving this coordination is unseen.\nWe may be driven socially to form\ngroups but how does that drive function\nin the individual to cause us to cohere.\nIn order to go beyond the observation\nand experiences we have with groups\nand group behavior, we need to\nunderstand what makes the engine of\nsocial connection run. At one level, we\ncan talk about language as a force itself,\nas Howard Nusbaum does. We can talk\nabout the synchronization of individual\nbehavior as Giin Semin does. However,\nboth of these are observations about the\nway individuals may become part of a\ngroup. To go beyond this we must look\nto our biology to understand how the\n\nmachinery underneath our sociality leads\n\nto connected minds.\n\nSemin suggested one way our\nbrains may seek to connect. Some\nneurons in an area of the brain that is\ninvolved in the control and planning of\nour actions also respond when we\nobserve actions we have performed.\nSuch neurons might be thought to\n“resonate” when seeing someone act or\nspeak with our own experiences.\n\nNeurons that mirror actions and behavior\n\nhave been thought to play a role in the\nprocess of understanding that behavior\nand the social connection that may form\n\nPage |74\n\nas aresult of the resonance. In the next\nessay, Steve Small discusses these neural\nmechanisms and how they may be\nimportant in helping us understand\nspoken language and possibly in\nunderstanding social behavior.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021320",
