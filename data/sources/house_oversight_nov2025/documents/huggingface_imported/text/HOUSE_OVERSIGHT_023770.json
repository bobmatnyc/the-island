  "text": "24 Teaching Minds\n\nwant to become teachers but the faculty are focusing on their\ngraduate students. They don’t teach the teachers. They do it, but\nit is not their focus.\n\nThe average professor of education here understands that he\nis supposed to teach teachers to teach but he gets evaluated on\nhis research not on the quality of teachers who come out. It is\na research university. How many dollars do you bring in? How\nmuch do you publish? Where would quality of teacher training\nfit in that model?\n\nSo, again, what exactly is effective teaching? Let’s look at two of the lon-\nger versions of what my former Ph.D. students and former employees\nwrote to me when I asked about good teaching. These stories each need\nsome context in order to be understood, and then I will comment.\n\nThe first story is from a Ph.D, student of mine who then continued\nto work with me for 30 more years.\n\nYou were collecting key things teachers needed to know to do\nstory curricula properly. Your contribution was “know when to\nlie to students.” That triggered all kinds of discussion, pro and\ncon, leading eventually to a longer, more explicit statement\nabout knowing when to oversimplify, etc.\n\nReflecting on it later, I realized that “know when to lie to\nstudents” was the right way to say it. The rephrased version was\ntoo reasonable. It didn’t trigger any emotional reaction and re-\nevaluation. “Know when to lie” is a lie, but that’s the point.\n\nWhy is this story important? I placed it here because it reflects an\nimportant belief that I hold about teaching. At the moment to which\nhe is referring, we were writing, as a group, a set of guidelines on how\nto teach Socratically using the online curricula we were building for\nhigh schools. We were, in essence, writing an instruction manual for\nteachers on how to teach in a new way. When I supervise very smart\npeople who know perfectly well how to do things, I deliberately pro-\nvoke them. I believe that my job is to make them think. There is no\nbetter way to make people think than by annoying them in a way that\nmakes them defend their point of view, especially when their point of\nview may not have been well thought out.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023770",
