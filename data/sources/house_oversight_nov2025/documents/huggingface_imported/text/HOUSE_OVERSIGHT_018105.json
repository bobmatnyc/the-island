  "text": "21\n\nEnemy disinformation, as well as simple error, can also set us on the\nwrong track. The enemy acts not just on the battlefield but also\nthrough an ability to influence our understanding of the situation by\nmeans of denial and deception. In this and other ways complexity\nreinforces uncertainty.1 The large number of actors involved in the\nIranian situation would make it very difficult to discern clearly what\nis happening once the shooting starts, and the scene would remain\nvery fluid as long as the fight persisted, and very likely for a good\nwhile afterward.2\n\nAs to the meaning of war, it may hardly seem worthwhile to probe\nsomething so self-evident, except that it is not self-evident anymore,\nif it ever was. A simple definition of war is the waging of armed\nconflict against an enemy, but this is too limited a concept in the 21st\ncentury. War in our time involves simultaneous conflict in the\nmilitary, diplomatic, economic and social domains on four levels:\npolitical, strategic, operational and tactical.3 While a war with Iran\nmight begin in the military domain, it would likely expand to others,\nand while it might begin at the operational or tactical level it would\nsoon encompass strategic and political levels as well.\n\nHow these twin expansions would take place has everything to do\nwith context. All wars have one. Would a U.S.-Iran war break out\nduring a protracted diplomatic process, or in the absence or abeyance\nof one? Would it happen during a period of increasing tension and\nmilitary readiness, or out of the blue, after one party thinks that the\ndangers of war have subsided? Would the U.S. government assemble\na broad “coalition of the willing’, just a few close allies-in-arms at\nthe ready, or go it alone, even actively dissuading Israel from joining\nan attack? What would the domestic political situation be in the\nUnited States? Would there be an internal political consensus to act,\nor would there be an active, acrimonious debate? Would the\nAmerican people be prepared for the aftermath of an initial attack,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018105",
