  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nin the marketplace of ideas. The ACLU policy has always been to oppose concerted efforts to\nprevent speakers from delivering their remarks, as evidenced by the brief filed in its name in the\nFranklin case. While supporting sporadic heckling and jeering that merely demonstrates\nopposition to the content of the remarks, the ACLU has always condemned type set of concerted\nefforts to silence invited speakers that occurred at Irvine.\n\nYet signatories of the letter -- which never once criticizes the censoring Muslim Union students\nwhile condemning those who wanted to hear the speaker -- include \"Chuck Anderson,\" who\nidentified himself as President ACLU Chapter, Orange County and Chair, The Peace and Freedom\nParty, Orange County;\" (a hard left anti-Israel group), and \"Hector Villagro,\" who identified\nhimself as \"Incoming Executive Director, ACLU of Southern California.\"\n\nDean Chemerinsky, while opposing criminal prosecution, made a point to condemn the censoring\nstudents:\n\n“The students’ behavior was wrong and deserves punishment. There is no basis for the\nclaim that the disruptive students were just exercising their First Amendment rights. There\nis no constitutional right to disrupt an event and keep a speaker from being heard.\nOtherwise, any speaker could be silenced by a heckler's veto. The Muslim students could\nhave expressed their message in many other ways: picketing or handing out leaflets\noutside the auditortum where Ambassador Oren was speaking, making statements during\nthe question and answer period, holding their own events on campus.”\n\nThe ACLU leaders, on the other hand, seemed to justify the actions of the censoring students\nwhile limiting their condemnation to the pro-Israel students who wanted to hear the speaker.\n\nAfter being criticized for supporting censorship, Villagro sought to justify his signing the letter by\nthe following \"logic:\"\n\n“The district attorney's action will undoubtedly intimidate students in Orange County and\nacross the state and discourage them from engaging in any controversial speech or protest\nfor fear of criminal charges.”\n\nThe opposite is true. If these students had been let off with a slap on the wrist from the\nUniversity, that would encourage other students around the nation and the world to continue with\nthe efforts to prevent pro-Israel speakers from delivering their speeches. Indeed, even after these\nstudents were disciplined, other students tried to shut down several Israeli students, who had\nserved in the Israeli Army, from recounting their experiences. Had the school administered\nappropriate discipline, I could understand an argument against piling on with a misdemeanor\nprosecution, but the red badge of courage given to them by the college only served to encourage\nrepetition of their censorial conduct.\n\n[37\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017224",
