But in no way is it\n\nanalogous to crimes, to assaults, he subsequently committed that mirror it, that come from it. I was just\nspeaking about my own experience. And the headline was, ‘He jerked off in front of me and I didn’t\ncare.’ And that’s so cold and insulting and awful to the women who were hurt by his actions. So if you\nclicked on it, they quoted me. But if you didn’t, and nobody does, it just makes me look like an asshole.\nAnd me looking like an asshole is the least of it. It hurt people and there was stuff that I said that I\ndon’t think I was articulating the spirit of what I meant.”\n\n<IMG 8787 vrvikb.jpeg>\n\n‘The Last Laugh’ host Matt Wilstein and Sarah Silverman\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026940",
