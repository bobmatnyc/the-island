  "text": "/ BARAK / 82\n\nissues raised by our proposals and showing a willingness to find common ground\nwould we have any hope of success. No recess, Clinton said. He needed a straight\nanswer. Again, not full acceptance necessarily, but agreement to treat the proposals\nas a basis for negotiating an Israeli-Palestinian peace. Arafat’s answer came shortly\nbefore dawn. It was “no”.\n\nClinton couldn’t quite believe it. He went back to see Arafat, telling him he was\nmaking an error on the scale of 1948, when the Palestinians had rejected the\npartition of Palestine and the creation of an Arab state; or in 1978, when by\nnegotiating on the basis of Sadat’s Palestinian-rights framework, they would have\nended up with a mere 5,000 Israeli settlers on the West Bank instead of nearly\n200,000. What most astonished Clinton was that Arafat was saying no even to\nusing the package as a basis for negotiations. Still, Arafat would not budge.\n\nAs Palestinian negotiators tried to salvage things by suggesting another trip by\nMadeleine and Dennis to the Middle East, it was clear that even the Americans\nwere fed up. They knew that one side, at least, had been trying to get an agreement.\nThey couldn’t understand why Arafat was unwilling even to accept the “pocket”\nproposals as a basis for further talks. When Yossi Ginossar, our most reliable\nconduit, went to see Arafat, he found him sitting alone and, in Yossi’s description,\n“paralyzed.” Clinton finally decided to have one last go. When he did, Arafat not\nonly remained unwilling. To the President’s astonishment, he insisted that the\nancient Jewish temple hadn’t been in Jerusalem at all, but in the West Bank city of\nNablus.\n\nI was getting a bite to eat in the dining room in Laurel Lodge when Madeleine\nshowed up. She didn’t bother defending Arafat. She was as frustrated as I was. Her\nmessage was that after the summit, it was important not to make things worse. A\nnegotiating process had to be kept alive. Then, Clinton sat down with me. He\ndelivered a similar message, but with even greater feeling. “You’re smarter than I\nam,” he joked. “You’re certainly experienced in war, and I’m not. But I’m more\nexperienced in politics, and there are a few things I’ve learned along the way. The\nmost important is not to corner your adversaries, and not to corner yourself.\nAlways leave yourself a way out. Don’t lock yourself into a losing option.” I could\nsee that he was right. I also believed, as strongly now as before the summit, that\nIsrael’s own interests and its security were not served by an unresolved conflict\nwith the Palestinians. The problem was that, in the absence of an equal\ncommitment on Arafat’s side, any continued negotiating process seemed futile.\n\n368\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011839",
