Several hundred US and British intelligence\nofficers worked around the clock in Washington DC, Fort Meade, Maryland and Cheltenham,\nEngland for months on end to determine if which parts could be still salvaged from what had been\nuntil the Snowden breach the most powerful communications intelligence system in the world.\n\nAdding insult to injury, Snowden, speaking from his new perch in Moscow, told applauding\naudience that the entire purpose of the U.S. exercise, including deliberately “trapping” him in\nMoscow, was to “demonize” him. For Russia, it was a textbook move. By providing Snowden\nwith this platform to rail against the surveillance practices of his adversaries, Putin laid claim to\nthe moral high ground in the Game of Nations.\n\nWhat remains missing from this picture is Snowden's motive in requesting documents from\nother foreign intelligence services, such as the GCHQ, and copying lists of NSA sources. It is\ndifficult to believe that his motive was conventional whistle-blowing since these documents were\nnot among those | he gave to journalists in Hong Kong. It will be recalled that his legal\nrepresentative in Moscow, Anatoly Kucherena, said that he taken to Russia, and had access to,\nNSA documents that he had not given to journalists. He had gone effort in his final weeks at the\nNSA to take documents that any adversary service would prize. Copying them was, as we have\nseen, part of his well-calculated plan. Did he use them, as he used the documents he gave to\nPoitras, Greenwald and Gellman, as leverage in his transformation? Since the role that Moscow\nmay have played in Snowden’s remarkable defection, while less visible than that of the movie-\nmakers, journalists and activist, cannot be ignored in this puzzle. Since it requires a closer\nexamination of the machinations that brought Snowden to Russia, I made arrangements to visit\nMoscow in October 2015.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020340",
