Salacious new chapter in Florida billionaire’s sex scandal
Jeffrey Epstein

For years, the story of South Florida billionaire money manager Jeffrey Epstein— involving allegations of human trafficking, an international underage sex ring, a Palm Beach

mansion, a private island inthe Caribbean, and an FBI investigation — has been tabloid fodder inthe United States and the United Kingdom.

Now, Fort Lauderdale lawyer Brad Edwards is helping to write a new chapter inthis murky and sordid tale. Representing two alleged victims identified only as Jane Doe#3 and Jane
Doe#4, Edwards filed a motionin U.S. District Court in West Palm Beach that alleges well-known criminal defense lawyer Alan Dershowitz and Prince Andrew, the Duke of York,

were involved in Epstein’s international sex ring.

“There’s absolutely no kernel of truth to this story,” said Dershowitz, who represented Epstein. “I don’t know this woman. I’ve never been inthe same place with her. She’s made up

the wholestory completely from whole cloth.”

Edwards’ motionrequests that his new clients join the case of two other alleged victims — identified as Jane Doe#1 and Jane Doe#2 in courtrecords — who are attempting to use the
Crime Victims’ Rights Act to forcethe U.S. Department of Justice to prosecute Epstein for sex trafficking of children by fraud and use of interstate commerce to entice a minor to

commit prostitution, among other offenses.

A wealthy Wall Streetmoney manager who had once attempted to purchase New York magazine, Epstein traveled the world in circles that included President Bill Clinton and

businessman Donald Trump. Despite his vast fortune and mansion in Palm Beach, Epstein kept a low profile and wasn’t a regular inthe wealthy island’s social scene.

The low profile vanished in2005, when a woman contacted the Palm Beach police fearing that Epstein had molested her 14-year-old daughter. The girl told detectives she’d been
invited to Epstein’s mansion, where she was paid $300 after stripping to her underwear and massaging Epstein as he masturbated. Police then located acommunity college student

who gave a swornstatement that she had taken six girls, all betweenthe ages of 14 and 16, to Epstein.

Police referred the case to the FBI. In September 2007, Dershowitz helped Epstein negotiate a then-secret non-prosecution agreement with the U.S. Attorney’s Office, which deferred

tothe Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office forcriminal charges, courtrecords show.
