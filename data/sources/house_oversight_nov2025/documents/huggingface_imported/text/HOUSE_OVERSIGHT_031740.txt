TRUMP IMPEACHMENT PETITION: CLICK HERE TO SIGN THE PETITION

WATCH: In a Shocking Turn of Events, Flynn
Moves To Take Down Pence.

An MSNBC panel says that former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn has information that could take down Vice
President Mike Pence. Flynn may have leaked information that shows Pence and the Trump transition team knew
that foreign governments were paying him.

If this information turns out to be true, 1t would be a devastating blow to the Vice President’s reputation. So far, Pence is
untouched by the Russia scandal.

The prevailing opinion is that Pence didn’t know anything about Flynn’s calls to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. And
the administration’s story is that Flynn lied about his Russian contacts to Pence.
