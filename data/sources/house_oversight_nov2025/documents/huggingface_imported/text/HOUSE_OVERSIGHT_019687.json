  "text": "The Rise of the NSA | 199\n\nEurope, President Franklin D. Roosevelt reactivated the operation\nas the Signal Security Agency. It proved its value in breaking the\nJapanese machine-generated cipher “Purple.” In June 1942, using\ndeciphered Japanese messages to pinpoint the location of the Japa-\nnese fleet at Midway, America won a decisive naval victory in the\nPacific. Germany’s Enigma encoding machines, with three encoding\nwheels, proved more of a challenge. Initially, British cryptanalysts\nled by the brilliant mathematician Alan Turing succeeded in build-\ning a rudimentary computer to decipher Germany’s messages to its\nsubmarines and bombers, but in 1942 Germany added a fourth set of\nencoding wheels, escalating what was essentially a battle of machine\nintelligence. The U.S. Navy then contracted with the National Cash\nRegister Company to build a computing machine capable of break-\ning the improved Enigma, and in May 1943 it succeeded.\n\nBy the time the war ended in 1945, the United States had over\none hundred giant decryption machines in operation. This unrivaled\ncapability to read the communications of foreign nations, which\nremained one of America’s most closely guarded secrets, was trans-\n\n© ferred to the Army Security Agency based at Fort Meade, Mary- ©\nland. Then, on October 24, 1952, President Harry S. Truman greatly\nexpanded its purview and changed its name to the National Security\nAgency.\n\nThe NSA was given two missions. The first one was protecting\nthe communications of the U.S. government. The main risk was that\nthe Soviets would find a way of breaching U.S. government chan-\nnels of communications. The second mission was intercepting all the\nrelevant communications and signals of foreign governments. This\nlatter mandate included the governments of allies as well as enemies.\nThe president, the other intelligence services, and the Department\nof Defense deemed what was relevant for national security. Even\nthough the NSA remained part of the Department of Defense, its\njob went far beyond providing military intelligence. It also acted as\na service agency to other American intelligence services. They pre-\npared shopping lists of foreign communications intelligence targets\nfor the NSA to pursue.\n\nAs the Cold War heated up in the 1960s, the NSA provided intel-\nligence not only to the Pentagon but to the Department of State, the\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 199 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019687",
