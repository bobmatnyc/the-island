But I have a brother who has HIV/AIDS,\nand my mum died of lung disease.\n\nWhat do you hear from your colleagues around the world about what California's doing?\nThey always say, \"You've got the best job in the world. How did California do this?” That's\nCalifornia. California is a can-do place, and when they want something, they stand up and do it. Many\n\nof [my colleagues] want to come to California. It's just a wonderful place. You could sail it off the\ncoast of America and it would be the most wonderful country in the world.\n\npatt.morrison@latimes.com.\nFollow Patt Morrison on Twitter @pattmlatimes\n\nThis interview was edited and excerpted from a taped transcript.
