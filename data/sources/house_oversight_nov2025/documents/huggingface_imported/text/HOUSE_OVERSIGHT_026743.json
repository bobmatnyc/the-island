  "text": "I think all scientists should, following his example, divert some of their efforts\ntowards public policy -- and engage with government, business, and NGOs\n\nWe need a focus on projects that are long-term in political perspectives, even if a\n\nmere instant in the history of our planet. And that’s something that universities can do -\n— not least because they’re full of young people who will live to the end of the century.\nWe should use their expertise to address the extreme ‘low probability/high\nconsequence’ threats that I’ve mentioned -- to assess which can be dismissed firmly\n\nas science fiction, and to consider how to enhance resilience against the more credible\nones.\n\nBut though we live under the shadow of these threats, and may be political\npessimists, we must remain techno-optimists. Advances in AI, biotech, nanotech and\nspace can boost the developing as well as the developed world. Indeed if we don’t\nresponsibly progress these new technologies we won’t achieve a bright vision.\nUndiluted application of the ‘precautionary principle’ has a manifest downside.\n\nWe're all on this crowded world together. “Space-ship Earth” is hurtling through\nthe void. Its passengers are anxious and fractious. Their life-support system is\nvulnerable to disruption and break-downs. But there is too little planning too little\nhorizon-scanning, too little awareness of long-term risks.\n\nA wise mantra is that ‘the unfamiliar is not the same as the improbable’.\n\nI want to conclude with some words from two scientific sages.\nFirst, HG Wells.\nBack in 1902. Wells was already alert to the risk of global disaster:\n\n\"It is impossible to show why certain things should not utterly destroy and end the\nhuman. story .. and make all our efforts vain .... something from space, or pestilence,\nor some great disease of the atmosphere, some trailing cometary poison, some great\nemanation of vapour from the interior of the Earth, or new animals to prey on us, or\nsome drug or wrecking madness in the mind of man\".\n\nBut nonetheless he retained a vision. \"Humanity\", he proclaimed, “has come some\nway, and the distance we have travelled gives us some earnest of the way we have to\ngo. All the past is but the beginning of a beginning; all that the human mind has\naccomplished is but the dream before the awakening.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026743",
