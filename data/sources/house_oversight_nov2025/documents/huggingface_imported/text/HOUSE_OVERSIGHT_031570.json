While his victory is highly likely, the question remains—down which\npath will he take Egypt? Al-Sisi’s support for the anti-Morsi protesters\nmay indicate support for the democratization of Egypt and the will of the\npeople. On the other hand, his bid looks like a giant leap backwards for\nEgypt, a return to a military dictatorship. Egypt has several potential paths\nforward under an al-Sisi government, none of which are ideal.\nUnfortunately, Egypt appears to be justifying analysts’ worst fears and\nwill likely return to a Mubarak-style military autocracy under al-Sisi.\n\nThe first option is a military government that enacts economic and\npolitical reforms that improve the lives of the citizenry, not just the\nmilitary or the elites. This will lead to a slower evolution toward\ndemocracy. On the plus side, slower evolution under a stable government\nwould allow structural changes to take root, fostering effective institutions\nand greater stability. The negative side is that evolution of this sort would\nbe neither smooth nor straightforward. It would come in fits and spurts,\npunctuated by returns to oppression and violence. It would also be\nextremely slow, and easy for a demagogue to reverse. Unfortunately,\ngiven Egypt’s current situation, option one is highly unlikely. Given the\nhigh levels of repression and violence, the only reforms the government\nwill likely enact would involve greater centralized power in its hands.\nFurthermore, there are a myriad of ways for a government to pay lip\nservice to democratization without actually decreasing its power. Another\noption is that Egypt becomes stuck in a proverbial time loop—trepeating\nthe revolution every year or two when the government fails to deliver on\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031570",
