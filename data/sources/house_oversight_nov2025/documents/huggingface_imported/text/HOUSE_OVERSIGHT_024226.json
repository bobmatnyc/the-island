  "text": "Global Utility White Paper CONFIDENTIAL\n\nAppendix 2: Global Utility Sector Background\n\ne =History\n\nTo gain a deeper appreciation of why the global utility sector is attractive for long/short investing, it is\nhelpful to briefly survey the history of the sector and describe the utility value chain’s components.\n\nThe utility industry as we know it began in 1882 when Thomas Edison built the world’s first generating\nstation on Pearl Street in downtown Manhattan. In the early decades the industry evolved along multiple\nlines but eventually settled into an integrated, fully-regulated model, deemed appropriate as utilities\nwere considered to have monopoly power. During the era of full regulation, utility stocks were often\ncharacterized as low-risk “widow and orphan” stocks in the US, and large parts of the global utility\nindustry remained government-owned. During these early days, long/short investing could not have\nexisted at scale, as the ability to find and generate short alpha would have been difficult given the sector’s\ngovernment ownership and bond-like nature of returns.\n\nIn the 1980s, Lord David Howell (formerly UK Secretary of State for Energy in the Thatcher government)\nadvocated having then-fully regulated power plants compete to sell their production into a competitive\npower market (a “power pool”) where the price of electricity would be set at the intersection of supply\n(power plants) and demand (industrial users and electricity supply companies selling to households). This\nled to the world’s first competitive power pools being rolled out in the UK in the early 1990s. While\nbased in Asia, Jos Shaver led UBS’ Asian utility industry group and had the privilege of working with Lord\nHowell when UBS acted as advisor to the State Power Corporation of China on the restructuring of that\ncountry’s national power industry.\n\nCompetitive power pools have since sprung up all over the world, and regulators have pulled apart\npreviously fully-integrated utilities in the name of efficiency and maximizing competition. In addition,\ngovernments around the world have begun to privatize their state utility industries and organize bespoke\ncompetitive market structures that best meet their needs. These changes have resulted in a hybrid\nmodern industry which continues to evolve.\n\nThe deregulatory impulse has brought tremendous benefits to national economies, driving down costs\nand improving efficiency and system reliability, but has also produced unintended consequences, e.g., the\nhigh-profile bankruptcies of Enron, British Energy, Dynegy, NRG, PG&E and others. As such, although one\ncan still find low-beta, low-volatility defensive stocks, the global utility sector has not been for “widow\nand orphan” investors for quite some time due to structural changes in an evolving industry that\ncontinue to alter the investment landscape.\n\nIt is important to note that the modern utility industry is still in its infancy, having begun in the early\n1990s, and its continued evolution — structural change — will provide ample long/short opportunities for\nthe foreseeable future. Structural change catalysts are driven by: i) a utility’s various stakeholders,\nincluding governments, managements, consumers, et al. which seek to mold the utility to their needs and\nobjectives, or ii) variables outside of stakeholder control such as commodity prices and new technologies.\nA specialist approach to the global utility sector is essential as each country’s market structure (and often\nthat of regions within countries) can be very different as a result of the varying levels of competition,\nmarket concentration, geographic constraints, infrastructure bottlenecks, regulatory constructs, fuel\nsupply availability and so on.\n\n25 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024226",
