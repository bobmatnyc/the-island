  "text": "of many contingencies and challenges.\nThis leads Aquinas to develop his\ntheology of marriage as a way of\nconsolidating and stabilizing parental\ncommitment, especially paternal\ncommitment, to their dependent\nchildren. *°\n\nAlthough neither Aristotle nor\nAquinas presented the full\nintergenerational scope of Cacioppo’s\ninterpretation of kin altruism and\ninclusive fitness — that it must extend to\nour children’s children and not just our\nown — both perspectives comprehended\nthe interlocking nature of kin altruism\nand the well-spring of care, long-term\nhuman commitment, and hence some of\nthe rudimentary energies of human\nmorality.\n\nOf course, Aquinas and those\nwho followed him supplemented these\nnaturalistic observations with additional\nepistemological presuppositions that\nmay seem strange to scientists. These\nincluded the idea that God works\nthrough nature as well as grace, hence\nGod is present in the kin altruistic\ninclinations of parents and grandparents.\nHe also assumed that in order for kin\naltruism to be stable, the additional\nsocial reinforcements of institutional\nmarriage and God’s strengthening grace\nand forgiveness were also needed. In\naddition, he held - and Christianity has\nalways taught - that Christian love\nincludes more than kin altruism and the\ncare of our familial offspring; it must\ninclude the love of neighbor, stranger,\nand enemy, even to the point of self-\nsacrifice. For the Christian, this was\nmade possible by the idea that God was\nthe creator of all humans and hence each\nperson was a child of God and made in\nGod’s image (imago dei). For this\nreason, as Kant would say on different\ngrounds, each individual should be\n\nPage |37\n\ntreated “always as an end and never as a\nmeans only.” °° In Aquinas’s view,\nacting on this belief, and with the\nempowering grace of God, made it\npossible for Christians to build on yet\nanalogically generalize their kin\naltruism to all children of God, even\nthose beyond the immediate family, their\nown children, and their own kin. These\nwider assumptions may be beyond the\ncompetence of science to assess. They\nentail a step toward metaphysical\nspeculation of the kind science would do\nbetter to avoid. Nonetheless, in the view\nof Christian love developed in Aquinas,\nthe seeds of a religious humanism — in\nthis case a Christian humanism —began\nto form.\n\nI have tried to illustrate how\ninsights from Aristotle and Aquinas can\njoin with insights from evolutionary\npsychology and social neuroscience to\nrefine the Christian understanding of\nlove. In pursuing this course, I join the\nwork of Stephen Pope and others in\npresenting this option. ”” The kind of\nChristian humanism found in Aquinas\nmakes it possible for Christianity to be\nenriched by the modern sciences of\nhuman nature. Aquinas’s view is\nstrikingly different from Nygren’s\nrepresentation of Paul and Luther when\nNygren contends that Christian love does\nnot build on our own natural energies,\nbut “has come to us from heaven.”** Or\nagain, it is very different from Nygren’s\nview when he writes that the Christian is\n“merely the tube, the channel through\nwhich God’s love flows.”” The\ncomplete discontinuity in this statement\nbetween the downward love of God and\nthe natural extension to nonkin of human\nkin-altruistic impulses is stunning. And\nsuch a view as Nygren’s precludes the\npossibility of a religious humanism of\nthe kind I have been describing. And it\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021283",
