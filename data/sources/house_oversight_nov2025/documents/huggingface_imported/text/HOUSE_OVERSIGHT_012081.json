  "text": "EM Growth? TABLE 1 highlights data from the 10 largest emerging mar-\nkets, which account for 89.2% of the MSCI Emerging Mar-\nkets Index. The growth prospects of this group appear sur-\nprisingly tepid. The median real GDP growth for the next\nfive years is forecasted at 2.5%, while population growth is\nexpected to be less than 1.0%. The term “emerging markets”\nwas coined in the 1980s, but frankly, most of these econo-\nmies have already “emerged.” The countries with the most\nlong-term economic growth potential are arguably those\nwith young, growing populations—namely, India, Indone-\nsia and Malaysia. However, these countries have small eq-\nuity markets that, when combined, do not even equal South\nKorea's in size.\n\nCAPE ratios are lower outside the U.S., with emerging mar-\nkets even lower than those in developed markets. While we\nhave been more constructive in recent issues of Global Fore-\nsight on non-U.S. opportunities, we believe there is limited rel-\nevance of CAPE ratios when comparing the very deep, diverse\nset of companies in the U.S. with most other markets. While\nvaluation from 30,000 feet looks better in many places, there\nare reasons to discount CAPE asa reliable valuation tool when\nanalyzing smaller markets. As an extreme example, Russia has\nthe lowest CAPE ratio in the world, but its equity market is\nvery concentrated in commodity businesses whose earnings\n\nare highly cyclical.\n\nTABLE 1: KEY DATA FROM THE TEN LARGEST EMERGING MARKETS\n\nESTIMATED\nINDEX LAST5 YEAR NEVE Geis POPULATION INFLATION MEDIAN FISCAL LEADING 10-YEAR SOVEREIGN\n\nGDP GROWTH GROWTH TO RATE POPULATION DpEBT/GDP MARKETP/E BONDYIELD DEBT RATING\nGDP GROWTH Mer AGE\n\nCOUNTRY WEIGHT\n\nCHINA 27.7% 7.3% 6.4% 0.6% 2.0% 371 x 3.5%\nSOUTH KOREA 15.4% 2.8% 2.7% 0.4% 1.3% 41.2 i 2.2%\nTAIWAN 12.2% 2.1% 2.2% 0.2% 1.4% 40.2 b 1.0%\nINDIA 8.8% 6.3% 7.5% 1.3% 5.0% 27.6 iE 6.5%\nSOUTH AFRICA 7.0% 1.6% 1.5% 1.6% 6.3% 26.8 z 8.4%\nBRAZIL 6.7% -0.4% 1.8% 0.7% 8.8% 31.6 . 10.7%\nMEXICO 3.7% 2.5% 2.4% 0.9% 2.8% 28.0 : 7.1%\nRUSSIA 3.3% 0.5% 1.5% -0.1% 7.1% 39.3 . 7.6%\nINDONESIA 2.5% 5.6% 5.3% 1.3% 3.5% 29.9 6.8%\nMALAYSIA 24% 5.1% 4.6% 1.7% 2.1% 28.2 17.9 3.8%\n\nSOURCE MSCI*ASOF BLOOMBERG BLOOMBERG IMF/ BLOOMBERG CIAWORLD MSCI/ BLOOMBERG\nMAY 31, 2017 BLOOMBERG FACTBOOK BLOOMBERG\n\n89.7%\n\nMEDIAN\nAVERAGE\n\nSources: Bloomberg, IMF, CIA World Factbook, MSCI, S&P\n\nAging Populations\n\nChina is a market that has looked attractively valued at times\n\nrelative to its growth prospects.

Countries that are major economic powers\nare aging rapidly, while most of the youth in the world is\nconcentrated in the poorest nations. One useful country demo-\ngraphic is the median age of its citizens. The U.S., with a median\nage of 37.9 years (half of all Americans are 38 or older), ranks\n62 out of 230 nations, making it one of the older nations in the\nworld, though one of the world’s younger developed markets.\nAging in the US. is dwarfed by comparison to most of Europe\nand Japan.
