BROWN\nMiami Herald\n\nMIAMI — A former top prosecutor\ninvolved in the Jeffrey Epstein sex case\nis defending his old boss, Alexander\nAcosta, whose decision to craft a secret\nplea deal with the wealthy New York\nhedge fund manager has come under\nfederal scrutiny.\n\nEpstein, who also has homes in Palm\nBeach, Fla., and New York, lives on\nLittle St. James Island off St. Thomas.\n\nIn his first public comments on the\n10-year-old case, Jeffrey H. Sloman\n\nwho at the time was second in com-\nmand under Acosta at the U.S. Attor-\nney’s Office in Miami — said prosecu-\ntors resolved the case based on the facts\nand evidence, and what he called “legal\nimpediments,” including the belief that\nmany of Epstein’s teenage victims were\ntoo “terrified” to cooperate in the case.\n\n“Given the obstacles we faced in\nfashioning a robust federal prosecution,\nwe decided to negotiate a resolution,”\nsaid Sloman, now in private practice.\n“We did not reach this decision lightly\nand it came only after significant and\noften rancorous internal debate.”\n\nIn a lengthy\nopinion piece sub-\nmitted to the Mi-\nami Herald Edito-\nrial Board, Sloman\nalleges that scruti-\nny of Acosta’s role\nin the controversial\ncase is being fu-\neled by politically\nmotivated — critics\nwho failed to raise\nsignificant issues\nwith it when Acos-\nta was nominated\nand confirmed as\nthe U.S. secretary\nof labor in 2017.\n\nSloman’ com-\nments come two\n\nweeks after the\nAlexander Justice — Depart-\nAcosta ment announced\n\nit had opened an\ninvestigation into whether there was\nprosecutorial misconduct in the case in-\nvolving Epstein, who ran a sex pyramid\nscheme from his Palm Beach estate\nthat targeted scores of underage girls\nfrom 2001 to 2006.\n\nJeffrey H. Sloman —\nwho at the time was\nsecond in command\nunder Alexander Acosta\nat the U.S. Attorney's\nOffice in Miami — said\nprosecutors resolved\nthe case based on the\nfacts and evidence, and\nwhat he called “legal\nimpediments,” including\nthe belief that many of\nJeffrey Epstein’s\nteenage victims were\ntoo “terrified” to\ncooperate in the case.\n\nAbout 30 members of Congress de-\nmanded the probe following a Miami\nHerald series of stories, “Perversion of\nJustice,” that detailed how federal pros-\n\necutors, led by Acosta, stitched together\nan unusual immunity deal that allowed\nEpstein to escape what could have been\na life sentence in federal prison.\n\nInstead, Epstein whose friends\nincluded President Donald Trump, Bill\nClinton and other politically connected\npeople — was allowed to quietly plead\nguilty to prostitution charges in state\ncourt. He served 13 months in the\ncounty jail, where he was allowed lib-\neral work release privileges rarely given\nto sex offenders in Florida and barred\nby the Palm Beach Sheriff's Depart-\nment’s own rules.\n\nHe was released in 2009, but his vic-\ntims — who were 13 to 16 years old at\nthe time — are still fighting more than\na decade later to have his non-prosecu-\ntion agreement overtumed.\n\nIn his op-ed, Sloman called Acosta\n“an outstanding public servant ... at\nrisk of becoming collateral damage in\nWashington's latest polarized confla-\ngration,” adding, “I won't let it happen\nwithout first being heard.”\n\n“As additional details about Epstein’s\ncrimes have emerged, it is clear to me\nthat we should have pushed for much\nharsher terms,” Sloman wrote. “That\n\nsaid, some have mistakenly suggested\nthat our office kowtowed to Epstein'’s\nhigh-priced defense lawyers or, worse,\nthat his lawyers corrupted or intimidat-\ned us into submission ... nothing could\nbe further from the truth.”\n\nSloman did not directly address the\nchief complaint brought by Epstein’s\nvictims, who are now in their late 20s\nand carly 30s. Those who spoke to the\nHerald said they felt betrayed by federal\nprosecutors, who sealed the non-pros-\necution agreement from public view\nso that they wouldn't find out about it\nbefore he was sentenced. It would be\nalmost a year before they were success-\nful in having it unsealed. By then, it was\ntoo late to try to derail it.\n\nThey allege, ina federal lawsuit filed\nagainst the govemment, that prosecu-\ntors deliberately kept the deal secret\n\nin violation of federal law — to pre-\nvent them from appearing at Epstein'’s\nsentencing to possibly undo the deal.\nNor did Sloman address why prosecu-\ntors also gave immunity to a number\nof Epstein’s co-conspirators, who have\nnever been identified.\n\nSee EPSTEIN, page 8\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023125",
