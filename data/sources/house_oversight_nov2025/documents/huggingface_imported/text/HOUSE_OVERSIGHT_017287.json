They were placed on the floor in a circle and\nsystematically shot in the head, apparently by a group of armed robbers. Originally, a motorcycle\ngang was suspected of the crime. After a lengthy interrogation, four of them confessed, but it\nsoon became clear to the police that they had been pressured into making false confessions and\nthey were freed.\n\nDoody, who was 1_ at the time, was then arrested and subjected to a similarly pressured 12 hour\ninterrogation. The police began by giving him his Miranda warnings: you have the right to\ncounsel; you have the right to remain silent; and anything you say can and will be used against you\nin the court. They then proceeded, gradually, to “demirandize” him, by taking back everything\nthey had originally said! You have a right to an attorney “if you were involved in [the murders]”;\nanything you “tell us” is “gonna stay right here” and not be used “in court;” and “you just have to\nopen up” —that is confess—and we will keep you here until you do. Finally, the exhausted _\nyear old confessed to being involved with the motorcycle gang—which the police knew was\nuntrue—and to participating in the killings. Based largely on this questionable confession, he was\nconvicted and sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nWhen I first became involved in the case, I decided to do my own investigation. The murder\nscene was near a United States Airbase and I learned that Russia was selling some of the Soviet\nUnion’s old satellite photographs of the United States. I bought the photographs for the day and\nlocation of the murder in the hope that perhaps they might show evidence that people other than\nDoody were responsible for the crime. Unfortunately, the sky was overcast that day and the\nphotographs were useless. We would have to limit ourselves to making arguments based on the\nrecord of the trial, with an emphasis on how the police had elicited the confession from Doody. I\ndid extensive research on the “science”—or “art”—of eliciting confessions from reluctant\nsuspects. I learned how the interrogators place objects from the crime scene in view of the\nsuspect, how they suggest answers, how they create an atmosphere of intimidation and\nomniscience, and how they contrive to turn the Miranda warnings to their own advantage.\n\nI argued the initial appeal, along my brother Nathan’s office in 19__. The Arizona Supreme\nCourt affirmed the conviction. My brother’s partner, Victoria Eiger, then took prime\nresponsibility for preparing a federal writ of habeus corpus. My brother and I worked closely\nwith her. The matter simply sat before the federal judge for ___ years, before she rendereda___\npage decision denying relief. We then appealed the denial to a panel of the United States Court of\nAppeals for the 9\" Circuit, which reversed Doody’s conviction in a 2-1 decision that ruled his\nconfession involuntary and ordered him to be freed, unless the state granted him a new trial. The\nstate then appealed the reversal to the entire 9\" Circuit, which set the case down for argument\nbefore 11 judges. They also ruled in Doody’s favor by a vote of 9-3. Still the case was not over.\nThe state sought a writ of certiorari from the Supreme Court which remanded the case back to\nthe 9\" Circuit for reconsideration in light of a recent Supreme Court decision. The 9\" Circuit\nreconsidered and once again threw out Doody’s conviction on the ground that the confession was\n\n200\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017287",
