  "text": "evidenced by the heated rhetoric, is a perfect foil that can be easily\nactivated at a moment’s notice.\n\nIsrael, for historical, emotional and realpolitik considerations, has\nbeen one of Washington’s closest allies with great support of both\naisles of the political divide. A deepening crisis could even pit the\nadministration against Congress. This may be one of the outcomes\nthe Turks are banking on. The Netanyahu government has much to\nanswer for in its lack of leadership and navel gazing. But Washington\ndid not read Turkish intentions and goals accurately and therefore\ncould not prevent this turn of events. Whichever way one looks at it,\nit is a failure of U.S. diplomacy that it will now have to constantly\nhave to act as a buffer between two of its close allies.\n\nHenri Barkey is a visiting fellow at the Carnegie Endowment for\n\nInternational Peace and a professor of international relations at\nLehigh University.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025005",
