We did not choose the most recent 40-year period (1969\nto 2009) as USA was in deep recession in 2008 / 2009 and underwent significant\ntax policy fluctuations in 1968 /1969 and subsequently many metrics (like individual\nincome and corporate profit) varied significantly from ‘normal’ levels.\n\nTotal USA Inc. revenue (collected via taxes) has grown at an average 3%\nannual rate, in-line with 40-year GDP growth rate. Corporate taxes have -— on\naverage — grown at 2% annually over 40 years. Social insurance taxes (for\nSocial Security and Medicare) have grown at an average 5% annual rate,\nabove the 3% GDP growth.\n\nQuestions:\n\n1) How crucial is the role played by lower relative tax rates — especially for\ncorporations — in stimulating job and GDP growth and helping American maintain /\ngain / constrain loss of global competitive advantage?\n\n2) Should social insurance tax growth be more closely aligned with GDP growth?\n\nNote: All data are inflation adjusted using GDP price index from BEA; 05 vs. 40-yr variance is rounded.\n\nKP Data source: White House Office of Management & Budget.\nwww.kpcb.com ne. at Might a Turnaround Expert Consider?\nB kpeb USA Inc. | What Might a T id rt Consider? 226\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020954",
