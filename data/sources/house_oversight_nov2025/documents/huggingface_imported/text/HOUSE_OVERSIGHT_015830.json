  "text": "140 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nNow spelling does knot phase me,\nIt does knot bring a tier.\n\nMy pay purrs awl due glad den\nWith wrapped word’s fare as hear.\n\nToo rite with care is quite a feet\n\nOf witch won should bee proud,\n\nAnd wee mussed dew the best wee can,\nSew flaw’s are knot aloud.\n\nSow ewe can sea why aye dew prays\nSuch soft wear four pea seas,\n\nAnd why eye brake in two averse\nBuy righting want too pleas.\n\nThe Search for Knowledge\n\nI hope this explanation shows you the simplest model for creativity -—\nworking through every possibility, and examining them all — is doomed\nto failure. It would take longer than until the end of time to even list all\nthe options, let alone analyze them.\n\nYou might wonder just how long it is until the end of time? It’s\ngenerally assumed there are two possible ends to the Universe, a Big\nCrunch or heat death. Either way the approximate estimate is our\nUniverse will last somewhere between one and fifty times longer than\nit has lasted so far. That’s a long time, at least another 15 billion years,\nbut just generating War and Peace would take 5000 orders of magnitude\nlonger than this!\n\nMore complex models such as a three-step process have been\nsuggested. We could perhaps randomly create information and put\nit through a mechanical filter to bring it down to a manageable set of\noptions and then give it to an appreciation algorithm to finally decide\nwhether we have created something. The real problem with this model is\nthe filters. If we try to reduce the effort by assembling works only from\npre-existing words, we will have filtered away many works we know and\nlove. Gone are Shakespeare, Lewis Carroll, Dylan Thomas and Roald\nDahl, shall I go on? Indeed, once upon a time there were no words, every\nword was coined at some point. The process of creating art is continually\ncreative and mechanical filters can't be applied to things they have not\nseen before.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015830",
