Instead\nthe PM has been merely following the course of Obama, who, according to Bruno, does not know what he\nwants. Such an approach has weakened the influence of France on the international arena and has undermined\nits sovereignty.\n\nAlso watched some other videos of him - Bruno attacks Hollande for his tax policy and excuses him for \"not\nknowing what he is doing\".\n\nOn Sun, Sep 22, 2013 at 7:39 AM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nhttp://video. lefigaro.fr/figaro/video/echange-muscle-entre-le-maire-et-fabius/2664796316001/\n\nBS DIS DIC 2k DIS ik 24S BIS DIS 54S iS DIS IC 24S BIS DIR 2S 2k DIS IC 24K BIS DIS DIC DC DIS IC 24S BIC DIS 2S DC DIS IC DIC IS DIS FIC Dk DIC iC DIC IS OIC 51S Df OIC 2k OIC DS OIC IC 24 OIC 2k OIC i 2k ic\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
