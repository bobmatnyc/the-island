  "text": "systems of knowledge that are in\nopposition. This approach is common\nand evident in a spate of contemporary\nbooks that take the position that science\nand religion represent competing ways\nof understanding the world and that\nscience (or religion) is the one and only\nvalid way of understanding human\nbehavior and the world around us (3-8).\nFor instance, in 7he God Delusion,\nRichard Dawkins places specific Judeo-\nChristian theological doctrines under the\nscrutiny of science only to find that none\npasses scientific muster.\n\nThe vast majority of people from\nall educational backgrounds continue to\nharbor strong religious beliefs that affect\ntheir daily decisions and behavior, with\nboth good and ill effects. These\nreligious belief systems most commonly\nbump into scientific claims around\ninvisible forces. When science opens up\nopportunities to improve the human\ncondition by providing a more complete\nunderstanding of the causes of events,\ntheir measurable effects, and possible\ninterventions— ranging from valid\nscience education to medical\nadvancements based on stem cell\nresearch — these opportunities are often\nthreatened by the application of specific\nreligious beliefs to these endeavors.\nScientific research to understand religion\nand religious belief systems may be a\nmore productive response than broad\ndenouncements by scientists of any who\nhold such beliefs.\n\nConversely, when religion opens\nup opportunities for improving the\nhuman condition by questioning the\nemphasis on short-term self-interests at\nthe expense of the collective, providing a\nmore complete understanding of the\nhuman need to attribute meaning to\nevents and their effects, and identifying\npossible interventions— ranging from the\n\nPage |13\n\nprovision of tangible support to\nindividuals in need, to the promotion of\nhealthy lifestyles and ethical behavior—\nscientific research to understand these\ninfluences may again be a more\nproductive response than broad\ndenouncements by scientists that such\nbeliefs are irrational. Indeed, the\nquestion of whether God exists is of\nmuch less scientific interest, and of\nmuch more questionable scientific merit\n(how would one scientifically falsify\nsuch a claim?), than the question of the\ncauses, consequences, and underlying\nmechanisms for the observable human\nbehaviors affected by invisible forces---\nwhether they be physical (gravity),\nsocial (groups), or perceived spiritual\n\n(gods).\n\nContemporary science explains\nmany of these phenomena but also\npoints to the human capacities and\nemergent processes that derive from\ncollective social structures and actions\nand, underlying the emergence of these\nstructures, the human need for meaning-\nmaking and connecting to something\nbeyond oneself. The dominant metaphor\nfor the scientific study of the human\nmind during the latter half of the 20\"\ncentury has been the computer — a\nsolitary device with massive information\nprocessing capacities. Computers today\nare massively interconnected devices\nwith capacities that extend far beyond\nthe resident hardware and software of a\nsolitary computer. The extended\ncapacities made possible by the internet\ncan be said to be emergent because they\nrepresent a whole that is greater than the\nsimple sum of the actions that are\npossible by the sum of the individual\n(disconnected) computers that constitute\nthe internet. The telereceptors (e.g.,\neyes, ears) of the human brain have\nprovided wireless broadband\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021259",
