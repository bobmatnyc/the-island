Subject: "Both Sides Now w/ Huffington & Matalin"

Dear Friend,

Mary Matalin and Hilary Rosen debate torture, Afghan, and Obama after Osama. How is the Barack & Hillary
"Team of Rivals" performing on foreign policy? And the women clash on Gingrich and Gibson (Mel).

Here, fyi, is today's HuffingtonPost feature and audio:

Best,
Mark
