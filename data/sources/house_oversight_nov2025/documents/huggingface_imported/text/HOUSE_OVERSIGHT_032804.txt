Jeffrey - Neal

Neither of you requires introduction. I've known Jeffrey 28 years and this isn't a joke -
Donald Trump introduced us. I first met Neal in 16 years ago when Bob Pirie introduced
US ...

Neal will be visiting NYC end of month.

I think you would both enjoy spending time together -

Thanks to you both for always supporting me.

You are both copied.

Melanie
