Israel had good\nrelations with them before. It can do so again.\n\nFortunately for Israel, and unfortunately for Khamenei, Israel even\nhas the option to hurt the regime on its very own streets.\n\nThat option is the cessation of verbal military threats against Iran.\nCessation of military threats from Israel will make it much harder for\nthe regime to divert the public's attention away from its falling\npopularity and serious domestic problems. Silence from Israel will\nmake Iran's leaders more worried, as it will rob Khamenei from an\nimportant tool which has helped him, and at a crucial time when the\nregime is hemorrhaging legitimacy and popularity at an\nunprecedented rate. The damage such an endeavour will cause is\nworth the inconvenience of Israeli politicians having to bite their\ntongues. Cessation of verbal threats will also prevent significant\nfuture damage being caused to Israel's deterrence posture if, at the\nend of the day, it decides to not to attack Iran's nuclear installations.\nCoelho once said:\n\n\"Be careful. You can hurt with your words, but you can also hurt with\nyour silence.\"\n\nThe words of a wise man.\n\nMeir Javedanfar is an Iranian-Israeli Middle East analyst and co-\n\nauthor of The Nuclear Sphinx of Tehran: Mahmoud Ahmadinejad\nand the State of Iran.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032185",
