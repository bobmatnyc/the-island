  "text": "increased. As a result, governments and engineers used feedback from accident statistics\nto implement countless regulations, devices, and design changes that made technology\nprogressively safer. The fact that some regulations (such as using a cell phone near a gas\npump) are ludicrously risk-averse underscores the point that we have become a society\nobsessed with safety, with fantastic benefits as a result: Rates of industrial, domestic, and\ntransportation fatalities have fallen by more than 95 (and often 99) percent since their\nhighs in the first half of the 20th century.”° Yet tech prophets of malevolent or oblivious\nartificial intelligence write as if this momentous transformation never happened and one\nmorning engineers will hand total control of the physical world to untested machines,\nheedless of the human consequences.\n\nNorbert Wiener explained ideas, norms, and institutions in terms of computational\nand cybernetic processes that were scientifically intelligible and causally potent. He\nexplained human beauty and value as “a local and temporary fight against the Niagara of\nincreasing entropy” and expressed the hope that an open society, guided by feedback on\nhuman well-being, would enhance that value. Fortunately his belief in the causal power\nof ideas counteracted his worries about the looming threat of technology. As he put it,\n“the machine’s danger to society is not from the machine itself but from what man makes\nof it.” It is only by remembering the causal power of ideas that we can accurately assess\nthe threats and opportunities presented by artificial intelligence today.\n\n*5 Steven Pinker, “Safety,” Enlightenment Now: The Case for Reason, Science, Humanism, and Progress\n(New York: Penguin, 2018).\n\n83\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016303",
