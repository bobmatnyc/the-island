The history of Iran's\nconfrontation with the international community suggests that keeping it a\ncrisis situation benefits the Islamic Republic. Ironically, it is the Western\npowers that have generated alarmist conditions. And then to escape the\npredicament of their own making, they offer Iran more concessions and\nfurther incentives.\n\nTo avoid a repeat of that outcome, it would be prudent to have a sense of\nproportionality and appreciate that, in the end, time works best for the\nUnited States and not the economically beleaguered theocracy.\n\nRay Takeyh is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.\n\nArticle 2.\n\nThe Guardian\n\nWhether it's North Korea or Iran, sanctions\nwon't work\n\nSimon Jenkins\n\n13 February 2013 -- Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. \"Threats\nand sanctions have not weakened the regime’s determination to proceed\n[with nuclear weapons], but rather weakened opposition to it’.
