  "text": "/ BARAK / 53\n\nsuggested that Damascus confirm in writing that this part of the Golan was indeed\nLebanese. The Syrians never responded.\n\nEqually predictable were the prophets of doom on the Israeli right, who said the\nLebanon withdrawal would bury northern Israel in Katyushas and in blood. The\nreality was that in the half-dozen years following the pullout, the Israel-Lebanon\nborder was quieter than at any time since the late 1960s. The main personal impact\nof the withdrawal, however, was to remind me of why I’d run for Prime Minister in\nthe first place. Despite the challenges, and inevitable setbacks and frustrations, of\nmy first year in office, I was in a position to act on what I believed to be critical\nissues for my country’s future. On Lebanon, I’d succeeded, mainly because the\nwithdrawal was something we could do unilaterally. With Syria, Id tried hard to\nget an agreement, only to find that Assad was unwilling, unable, or perhaps too ill\nto join in the search for a deal.\n\nI still recognized, however, that no issue was more important to Israel’s future\nthan our conflict with the Palestinians. I knew that resolving it would be even\ntougher than the talks with the Syrians. But the only way to find out whether peace\nwas possible was to try. So on the final day of May 2000, with the Lebanon pullout\ncomplete, I flew to Portugal — the site of a US-European summit — to see President\nClinton.\n\n339\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028187",
