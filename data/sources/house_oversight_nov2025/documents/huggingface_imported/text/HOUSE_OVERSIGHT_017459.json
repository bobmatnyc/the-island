  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nMartha Stewart\n\nI knew Martha Stewart in law school. Her then husband was my classmate. When she got in\ntrouble, she called me and we discussed her situation. She had been indicted for acts she was\naccused of committing after she retained top flight lawyers. She then hired another top flight\nlawyer, Robert Murcalo, to represent her. He did a terrible job and she was convicted. She went\nto jail largely as the result of the lawyers she had picked. By the time she called me, it was too\nlate to do very much. She picked excellent lawyers for her appeal and I consulted with them, but\nthe court affirmed her conviction and she went off to serve her relatively short prison sentence.\nShe has now rebounded and her conviction will be a small footnote in her otherwise successful\nand productive life.\n\na72\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017459",
