  "text": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\nof time if Mr. Wagner had been aware of the situation and filed the proper notice\nwith Town Council.\n\nMr. Lynch said if some sort of arrangement could be reached today, his client\nwould be in a position to pay within the next two weeks. Mr. Hoffman said he\nwas concerned because he believed that when the case was originally heard, they\nhad the option of fining $250.00 a day and they gave them a fine reduction at the\ntime they initiated the fine of $125.00 a day. Mr. Walton corrected Mr. Hoffman,\nadvising that there was a motion for a fine of $125.00 a day which failed and the\nfine that is in effect is $250.00 a day. Mr. Lynch said he believed the record\nreflects something different than that. Mr. Walton said his records reflect $250.00\na day but he would review it. Mr. Walton reviewed the transcript and noted that it\nshowed $125.00 a day but the Board order specified $250.00 a day and he would\nhave to do further research.\n\nMr. Fried advised he could make a motion to postpone the matter to the next\nmeeting and have Mr. Walton bring back the correct information. There was\nadditional discussion about the amount of the fine and Mr. Lynch said he was\nseeking a reduction of the $17,125.00 which would be the amount of the fine if it\nwas $125.00 a day. Mr. Hoffman said he would find that hard to accept. Mr.\nHoffman read from the minutes that a motion was made by Mr. Fried that the\ndefendant was found in non-compliance, ordered to pay an administrative fee in\nthe amount of $150.00, obtain a final building inspection by October 25, 2008 and\na fine of $125.00 to commence on October 26, 2007. He said that motion passed\n4-3. Mr. Walton said he could not dispute that but he would have to do some\nresearch. Mr. Hoffman said he would not be in favor of reducing the $17, 125.00\nany further.\n\nMr. Ochstein said he was hesitant to do anything until they know what the number\nis. Mr. Walton suggesting postponing the case until the next month.\n\nMOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO POSTPONE THE FINE REDUCTION\nHEARING UNTIL AUGUST 21, 2008\n\nSECONDED BY MR. FRIED\n\nMOTION OPPOSED\n\nROLL CALL VOTE:\n\nMR. OCHSTEIN YES\nMR. FRIED YES\nMS. DUEMLER YES\nMS. GREENBERG NO\nMS. VAN BUREN NO\nMR. BALLENTINE YES\nMR. HOFFMAN NO\n19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016592",
