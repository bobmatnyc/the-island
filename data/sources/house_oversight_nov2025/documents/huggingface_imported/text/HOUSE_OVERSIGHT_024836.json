Various combinations of the aforementioned precursors then combine in the\nthird pathway to yield parent cannabinoid molecules (e.g., cannabigerolic acid\nor CBGA).\n\niv. These parent cannabinoids are then modified in the fourth pathway to produce\ncannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinolic acid (THCA) and cannabidiolic acid\n(CBDA). These acids can be transformed into a non-acid form using synthases,\nproducing the terminal cannabinoid form.\n\nFigure 11 Biosynthetic Cannabinoid Production Pathways\n\nGlucose\n\nPyruvate @=\n\nAcetyl-CoA @==\n\nTCA Cycle\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nCannabinoid Production Using Fermentation\n\nTo power the aforementioned pathways, water and glucose (or a cannabinoid substrate)\nare added to the microbe (e.g., yeast) in a bioreactor. Under fermentation, the yeast will\nconsume the glucose and produce the desired cannabinoid.\n\nThis culture is incubated for ~3-5 days to produce sufficient cannabinoid intermediaries.\nAfterwards, the fermentation mixture is separated and combined with a non-toxic\n\nsolvent to extract and purify the cannabinoids.\n\nRecent Cannabinoid Partnerships In Synthetic Biology\n\nWith the recent legalization of cannabis in several countries and U.S. states and growing\nacceptance of its utility, many recent notable partnerships have been created on the\npotential of synthetic cannabinoid production. We highlight two such agreements from\nthe past few months below.\n\nAmyris / Undisclosed Partner (February 2019; Valued Up to $255MM)\n\nIn February 2019, Amyris announced that it has signed an agreement for cannabinoid\ndevelopment, licensing, and commercialization in a partnership valued at up to $255MM\n(not including royalties for commercial products) with an undisclosed partner. The\n$255MM in payments include an upfront payment and the remainder is linked to\nmilestones that are expected over the next 12-36 months. The partner is expected to\nprovide initial, lab-based and later commercial-scale milestone cash payments in\ntranches for the development and scaling of technology to produce CBD.\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024836",
