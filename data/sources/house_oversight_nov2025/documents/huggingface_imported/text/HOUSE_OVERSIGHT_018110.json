In such a\nbroad and protracted contest, the United States might not enjoy a\nfavorable balance of advantages. It is by no means clear, either, that\nthe U.S. government is structured to effectively prosecute such a war,\nor that its intelligence capabilities are oriented properly toward\nsupporting it.\n\nGiven these caveats and complexities, it seems to follow that if the\nUnited States chose to attack Iran, it would do so in ways that would\nprevent Iran from expanding the conflict into areas where it held an\nadvantage. The reasoning might go something like this: Since the\nIranian regime has many ways to widen a war into domains that do\nnot favor the United States, the best option is to execute regime-\nchange before the regime can open its bag of tricks. Or it might go\nlike this: Start small, but if the Iranians escalate the war, shift\nimmediately to a regime-change option before they can succeed.\nAlmost needless to say, these are hard-to-control and high-risk\napproaches. A decapitation strategy, we know, did not fare so well in\nMarch 2003 against Iraq, and it would probably be harder to pull off\nagainst a more deeply institutionalized polity like Iran.\n\nAs for a “start small” approach, let’s suppose that the war begins with\na limited air and naval operation. Iran could respond in a limited “tit-\nfor-tat” way. But the regime might conclude that the operation is\nintended to remove it from power (or succeed in doing so\nunintentionally); if so, it might respond with a high level of violence\nalong several axes of capability. There is simply no way to predict\nwith confidence how radicals in Iran would respond to an initially\nlimited U.S. attack. We must base our predictions largely on what the\nleadership says, the Iranian regime’s history and our limited\nintelligence on the regime’s internal dynamics.8 All this is subject to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018110",
