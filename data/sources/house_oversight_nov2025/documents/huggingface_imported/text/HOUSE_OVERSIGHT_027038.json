For breakfast and taping at my house. Depends on what woody is up for. My ideal \nwould be a 1/2 hour-40 minute conversation, but we could do a quick taping in 15 minutes ...my team can be \nready \nAnd , just to remind,could also come to do taping in ny on 24th because I'm coming to New York the evening \nof 23rd for a YIVO event--to which you would both be most welcome I'm sure (YIVO is the largest collection \nof materials from Jewish Eastern Europe) \nLisa \nSent from my iPhone \nOn Oct 5, 2013, at 8:36 PM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nhow much time should i allocate? \nOn Sat, Oct 5, 2013 at 3:26 PM, Lisa New <1 wrote: \nOr we could do the taping at my house.

If \nWoody wanted, we could bring some students into the taping or just do the two of us... \nWoody is absolutely welcome to come to the seminar, of course \nJohn McCain, Tony Kushner, Al Gore have all signed on the last 2 days...crazy \nLisa \nOn Sat, Oct 5, 2013 at 1:50 PM, Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \ndoes the 23 work in cambridge \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027038 \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
