Indeed, Bashar may already have\nlost authority to men like his brother, Maher al-Assad, commander of\nthe regime’s Republican Guard, who seems to advocate crushing the\nprotests by force. If the army and the security services remain loyal, it\nwill be difficult for the opposition to unseat the regime. But there\nhave been ominous rumours of army defections as well as reports that\nsome members of the Ba’ath Party have resigned.\n\nIt needs to be recognised that the Assad regime does have determined\nenemies, at home and abroad, who conspire against it in the\nneighbouring countries -- Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and\nalso Israel -- and among Syrian exiles in London, Paris and the US.\nThese enemies have smelled blood. Riding on the turbulent wave of\npopular dissent, they will not easily give up.

Bashar’s whole\ncareer -- like that of his father before him -- has been shaped by\nSyria’s contest with Israel. Syria has had to live, fight and survive in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024966",
