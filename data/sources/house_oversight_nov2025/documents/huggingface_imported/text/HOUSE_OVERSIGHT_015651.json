  "text": "her as a “victim” of federal sex offenses. Unsurprisingly, her deposition contains highly sensitive\ninformation about her experiences as a minor child, including detail descriptions of sexual crimes\ncommitted against her.\n\nARGUMENT\n\n1. Non-Party Virginia Giuffre Agrees That Her Deposition Should Be Provided\nConfidentially To Law Enforcement to Investigate All The Crimes Committed\nAgainst Her\n\nDefendant Dershowitz seeks to have the Court grant an exception to the confidential nature\nof the deposition so that it can be provided to the Office of the State Attorney and the Office of the\nUnited States Attorney for investigative purposes. Specifically, Defendant Dershowitz states in\nhis motion that he is hoping to have law enforcement investigate whether Ms. Giuffre committed\nperjury by stating in her previously filed affidavit that it is her recollection that she witnessed\nformer President Bill Clinton on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in the United States Virgin Islands\n(“USVI’)'.\n\nSetting aside Defendant Dershowitz’s baseless claims of perjury, Ms. Giuffre agrees that\nher confidential deposition should be provided to law enforcement, including the United States\nAttorney and the State Attorney in each jurisdiction where any alleged crimes occurred so that\nthey may investigate all of the crimes committed against her when she was a minor child. To\nensure that justice is served and that Defendant Dershowitz’s request is not just another charade\ndesigned only to bully a sexual abuse victim, Ms. Giuffre asks the Court to impose the following\nreasonable conditions relating to the disclosure:\n\ne Mr. Dershowitz agrees and is directed to cooperate with authorities and answer all\nquestions relating to the investigation of crimes against Ms. Giuffre.\n\n' Defendant Dershowitz conveniently ignores that publicly available flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s private\nplanes demonstrate that President Clinton travelled with Jeffrey Epstein and others to various locations\nthroughout the world including Europe, Africa and Asia. See Exhibit C, Excerpts of Flight Logs from\nJeffrey Epstein’s private plane.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015651",
