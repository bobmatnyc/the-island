We focused on two tractates, Baba\nKama and Baba Metziah, in which the rabbis drew on verses from Exodus to\nargue out a system of rules for resolving civil disputes. It was the Talmud of\ntorts. The intricacy and the depth of the rabbinical debate fascinated me.\n\nYigal returned from the army a few months after the 1956 war, when, like\nother teenagers, I was about to enter a pre-military program known as Gadna.\nThere were several options kids could choose. One was linked to the air force,\nanother to the navy. But most of us joined the reconnaissance and scouting\ngroup, Gadna Sayerim. It involved studying topography and navigation, as well\nas field exercises that were a lot like the ones Yigal had put us through a few\nyears earlier. At year’s end, we took part in a national exercise. It was called, a\nbit grandiosely, Mivam el Yam: from sea to sea. We had to find our way from\nthe Mediterranean, near Haifa, across northern Israel to a lake which was a sea\nonly in name, the Sea of Galilee. It lasted three days. We were placed in teams\nof four. We were each given a topographical map and a compass, with\nlandmarks marked along the way which we had to find and draw in a notebook\nto prove we’d been there.\n\nA couple of hours in, we faced our first challenge. We were making our way\nalong a shepherds’ trail, with brush and bramble on either side, when the path\nsplit in two. We had to decide which fork to take. The map didn’t help. Each\ninch covered the equivalent of a mile-and-a-half. The key was to be able to\nmatch it with what we were seeing around us. To use points we could identify\nfrom the map — Haifa and the sea in the receding distance, and a taller hill to our\nnortheast — and then figure out which path was more likely to take us in the\nright direction. I knew this mix of calculation and imagination was something I\nenjoyed. But it was more than that. Each of us had had the same preparation for\nthe exercise. As my trek-mates turned to me for this first decision, and then on\n\n43\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011514",
