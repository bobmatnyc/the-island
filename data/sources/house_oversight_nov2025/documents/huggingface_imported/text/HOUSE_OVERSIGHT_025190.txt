Just arrived NY, here for ~10 days.
Now with the Trump-Xi Summit over (utterly overwhelmed by Syria strike), back to Closer To Truth.
When good to meet?

Robert

Hi: Just returned from a month in China. Attached is my summary of recent politics (in South China Morning
Post), and pics of moderating (at request of govts of China and Israel) the PM’s discussion with leading
Chinese technologist (Baidu CEO, dominant Chinese search engine). The PM was in China for 25th
anniversary of diplomatic relations

Back to CTT, my ‘true love’... Love to discuss Science of Sleep & Dreams project. I’m in LA for week and
then NY April 8-18.

Warm regards, Robert
