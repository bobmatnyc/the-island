All tracking could be done by the NSA. What the\nUnited States lacked was any practical means to capture a high-\nprofile intelligence defector in a city that was part of China. By this\ntime, U.S. intelligence had established that Chinese and Hong Kong\nsecurity services were monitoring Snowden’s every move. This left\nfew options in the game for the United States. “I’m not going to\nbe scrambling jets to get a twenty-nine-year-old hacker,” President\nObama said on June 27.\n\nThe real prize, in any case, was not Snowden but the NSA’s secret\ndocuments that he had with him. When Snowden was observed\nentering the Russian consulate, the game was all but over.

If any false\nflag operations had been used to trick, mislead, or otherwise induce\nSnowden to come to Hong Kong, they would be disbanded. If any\nsafe house had been used to quarter Snowden in his first eleven days\nin Hong Kong, it would be shut down.
