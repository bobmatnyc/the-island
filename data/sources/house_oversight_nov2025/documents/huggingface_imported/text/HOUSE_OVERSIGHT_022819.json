Kind regards - Matt\n\nA former employee has told us that Donald Trump attended Mr Epstein's Palm Beach estate on at least two occasions. Does Mr\nEpstein recall hosting Donald Trump at that residence?\n\nOn one such occasion, it has been suggested to us that Mr Epstein and Donald Trump watched “young girls try on bikinis” while\nmaking comments on the their bodies.” Does Mr Epstein have any comment?\n\nHow does Mr Epstein respond to claims that women - some under the legal age of sexual consent - were used as “sex slaves” at his\nproperties?\n\nA former employee of Mr Epstein has alleged to us that Mr Epstein sexually assaulted her on\nnumerous occasions. Does Mr Epstein have a comment?\n\nDid or does Mr Epstein have cameras inside rooms at his Palm Beach residence?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022819",
