  "text": "To bring in a wonderful 2009, I'd like to quote an e-mail I received from a mentor of more than a\ndecade:\n\nWhile many are wringing their hands, I recall the 1970s when we were suffering from an oil shock\ncausing long lines at gas stations, rationing, and 55 MPH speed limits on federal highways, a recession,\nvery little venture capital ($50 million per year into VC firms), and what President Jimmy Carter\n(wearing a sweater while addressing the nation on TV because he had turned down the heat in the White\nHouse) called a “malaise.” It was during those times that two kids without any real college education,\nBill Gates and Steve Jobs, started companies that did pretty well. Opportunities abound in bad times as\nwell as good times. In fact, the opportunities are often greater when the conventional wisdom is that\neverything is going into the toilet.\n\nWell... we’re nearing the end of another great year, and despite what we read about the outlook for\n2009, we can look forward to a New Year filled with opportunities as well as stimulating challenges.\n\nHappy New Year, everyone.\n\nHow to Travel the World with 10 Pounds or Less\n\nHhactins a five-piece Samsonite set around the planet is hell on earth. I watched a friend do this up\n\nand down dozens of subway and hotel staircases in Europe for three weeks, and—while I laughed a lot,\nespecially when he resorted to just dragging or throwing his bags down stairs—I’d like to save you the\nbreakdown. Trip enjoyment is inversely proportionate to the amount of crap (read: distractions) you bring\nwith you.\n\nPractice in 30-plus countries has taught me that minimalist packing can be an art.\n\nI returned from Costa Rica last Wednesday and have since landed in Maui, where I'll stay for one\nweek. What did I pack and why? (See the companion video at www.fourhourblog.com ®°)\nI practice what I'll label the BIT method of travel: Buy It There.\n\nIf you pack for every possible contingency —better bring the hiking books in case we go hiking, better\nbring an umbrella in case it rains, better bring dress shoes and slacks in case we go to a nice restaurant,\netc.—carrying a mule-worthy load is inevitable. I’ve learned to instead allocate $50—200 per trip to a\n“settling fund,’ which I use to buy needed items once they’re 100% needed. This includes cumbersome\nand hassle items like umbrellas and bottles of sunscreen that love to explode. Also, never buy if you can\nborrow. If you’re going on a bird-watching trip in Costa Rica, you don’t need to bring binoculars —\nsomeone else will have them.\n\nHere’s the Maui list.\n\ne » | featherweight Marmot Ion jacket (3 oz.!)\n\ne » | breathable Coolibar long-sleeve shirt to prevent sunburn. This\nsaved me in Panama.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013996",
