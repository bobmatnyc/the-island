Often in an OpenCog context, this refers to the PLN\nabduction rule, a specific First-Order PLN rule (If A implies C, and B implies C, then\nmaybe A is B), which embodies a simple form of abductive inference. But OpenCog may\nalso carry out abduction, as a general process, in other ways.\n\nAction Selection: The process via which the OpenCog system chooses which Schema to\nenact, based on its current goals and context.\n\nActive Schema Pool: The set of Schema currently in the midst of Schema Execution.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013242",
