The alternative is that this material was released at the behest of\nthe Russian intelligence service.\n\nThe mystery of the post Hong Kong documents also intrigued members in the US intelligence\ncommunity with whom I discussed it. When I asked a former intelligence executive about the\nultimate source for the Merkel story, he responded: “If Snowden didn’t give journalists this\ndocument in Hong Kong, we can assume an intermediary fed it to Appelbaum to publish in Der\nSpiegel?” According to him, the NSA investigation had determined that Snowden indeed had\ncopied a NSA list of cell phone numbers of foreign leaders, including the number of Merkel. This\nlist became the basis of the Der Spiege/ story. It was also clear that Snowden in Moscow gave\ncredence to the release. He made a major point about the hacking of Merkel’s phone in an\ninterview with Wired magazine in 2014. Just about two weeks before the leak, Kucherena said\nSnowden still had access to the documents. Clearly, someone had access. But whoever was\nbehind it, the release of information about the alleged bugging Merkel’s phone resulted in badly\nfraying US relations with Germany in the midst of developing troubles in Ukraine. As it later\nturned, according to the investigation of the German federal prosecutor concluded in 2015, there\nwas no evidence found in this document, or elsewhere, that Merkel’s calls were ever actually\nintercepted. Although they revealed little, if anything, the intelligence services of Germany,\nFrance and Israel were not already aware of, they raised a public outcry in allies against NSA\nsurveillance, and the outcry became the event itself.\n\nWhile these post-Hong Kong documents had little, if any, intelligence value, they provided\nfurther evidence that at least part of the stolen NSA documents was in the hands of a party hostile\nto the United States. Ifso, it wasn’t much of a leap to assume that this party also had access to\nthe far more valuable Level 3 documents revealing the NSA’s sources and methods, such as the\none that Ledgett had described as a “road map” to U.S. electronic espionage against Russia and\nChina.\n\nWithin the intelligence community, this concern was heightened by new counter measure to this\nespionage employed by Russia and China after Snowden reached Moscow. For example, there\nwere indications that the NSA had lost part of its capabilities to follow Russian troop movements\nin the Crimea and Eastern Ukraine. U.S. intelligence officials even went so far as to suggest,\naccording to a report in the Wall Street Journal that “ Russian planners might have gotten a jump\non the West by evading U.S. eavesdropping.”\n\n. Britain also discovered that some of its secret operations had been compromised after Snowden\n\nwent to Moscow. According to a 2015 story in the Sunday Times of London, British intelligence\nhad determined that Britain’s intelligence- gathering sources had been exposed to adversary\nservices by documents that Snowden had stolen from the NSA in 2013. These documents had\nbeen provided to the NSA by the GCHQ, the British cipher service. Unless such intelligence\ndisasters were freak aberrations, it appeared to confirm General Alexander warning in 2014 that\nthe NSA was “losing some of its capabilities, because they’re being disclosed to our adversaries.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020297",
