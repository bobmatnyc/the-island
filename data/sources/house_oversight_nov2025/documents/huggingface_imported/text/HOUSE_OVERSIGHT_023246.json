  "text": "document after another for over a year , no getting away from it,, badcash flows nonewIT, each\ntime with \" its gettting better\" no in fact -! itsnot. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is\nludicrous. of course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he\npresented them to you and me, after , holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after\nmultiple drafts. weeks of his editing, the consistant but \"inexplicable \"missing the obvious serious\nerrors .( gaming ) inaccuracies, ( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is\nthat at best, he is ac minus, (note. I, like you ,also give points for effort. )-! an elegant art partnership\ngone fallow. ??!!I and its core reason to exist. not used ? no docs for plane?, still ! why? no docs for\ndecantings why? the docs for deal | received last night , \"no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest \". why\nwasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant reminders your admonition etc. the trading\naccounts ?\n\nBarry Cohen is great. more like him please .\nyou asked ,- I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they\nwere never going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands? Brad at its head . you\ncan't as aceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing\naltogether and not notice, you and I saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after\nonly a cursory glance. He told me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to\npay less. no more than that, any other story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself.\nre your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision. the tenants in common structure I\nassume Alan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the\nmore serious issues in an email but we can speak over the weekend.\nHow can I help? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would\nbear no responsibility\n\nDate: Thu, May 12, 2016 at 6:17 AM\n\nSubject: tight schedule lets try a set time to speak\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella <\n\nLeon, you hired me to produce a work of art. it was not inexpensive. the value far exceeds any other\npiece in your collection.- by FAR. It took me 30 years to be able to craft such a work. I understand\nyour desire to modifiy my work, in doing so you have brad telling me , just a bit more red., here let me\nshow you, you yourself pick up a brush a add some strokes. you have joslin spray water on it to\nmaintain it. I vigorously complain that joslin in ruining my work .. you describe me as zeus, i describe it\nas artist and a reaction to his work being ruined. however Im aware that you own the work and you\nhave the right to paint over it. tear it up , put it in the closet in the basement . its yours.\n\nI was told that Toms office is sending someone in ,or some people in, to review \"some things.\" brad told\nme ,the partnership accounting. I know absolutely nothing more than that. though bringing in his team was\nmy idea . Having them review things without even asking for my input , or let alone my direction ,is\nridiculous. but.. I guess you wanted to save money. ?\n\nThe audit has brought to the fore the lack of your office quality that 1 have been violently squawking\nabout. ie. children playing with works of art. . It is inconceivable to me that John castrucct is still there\n, Joslin part time, but relied on . joe error prone and brad a corporate bandleader talking about the\noffice's finance team, accounting dept, and directing wendy to do things that are clearly not in your\ninterest. ( saving money again?) its nuts!! . a still non-existent IT dept. impossible , it was the first\nthing on my list of things that were needed to be done. Still no trading accounts to speak of , though its\nprophylactic quality has been discussed over and over during the past three years . computers do not read\nPage Six. the women atthe IRS do.! you said your motivation in keeping this group of part timers\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023246",
