  "text": "common way for electrical circuits, computer programs, brain mechanisms and\nother complicated systems, even cultural or spiritual movements, to behave when\none or more important control parameters crosses a threshold. Doyne Farmer of the\nLos Alamos’s Prediction Company once said about this vulnerability in complex\nsystem, “Those things can hardly wait to roll up.” The /imit cycle lock-up occurs\nmost often as a sudden, discontinuous change, called a_ bifurcation, into\nautonomous Sself-oscillations from an equilibrium state around which there was\nsome random variation. A bifurcation, a discontinuous change in outcome from a\nsmooth changes cause, characteristically occurs when the amount of an important\ninfluence, a metabolic state, a drug, a psychodynamic conflict or level of emotional\nstimulation crosses some critical value. The switch from one type of dynamical\nbehavior to another looks like the system has suddenly changed into something\nelse with an entirely new kind of life of its own. In the new life of rolled up, locked-up\nrepetitious motion, almost all new starting conditions follow pathways that lead into\nthe same limit cycle pattern. Evangelical Christians talk about a// born again life\nbeing in Jesus, fixed in a complete set of moral, social and political beliefs, ideas\nand judgments. The limit cycle gets its name because the end state of the orbits of\nalmost all starting points of the dynamics winds up being drawn into the same fixed,\nrepetitious pattern of a stable cycle. Visualizing the simulation of one kind of\nbifurcation to a limit cycle on a computer screen, we see a slightly jiggling point\nexplode suddenly into an orbit of ceaseless rotations around a circle.\n\nRalph Abraham, the University of California at Santa Cruz pioneer in\ngraphical approaches to nonlinear systems, describes, cinemagraphically, the\nemergence of limit cycles from a single point. He starts with a picture of an attractor\nof water flow in the shape of a basin. All water that enters the basin, rolls down its\nsides to the bottom, to what physicists say represents a potential energy minimum.\nA little more technically, this attractor basin is composed of the set of all points such\nthat the orbits that flow from them tend to end up inside the basin as time goes\ntoward infinity, no matter where they start. Changing the value of a control\nparameter of the system changes the shape of this basin-like landscape, of the\n\nsurface of the systems dynamical actions called a manifold, which can intuitively\n\n152\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013652",
