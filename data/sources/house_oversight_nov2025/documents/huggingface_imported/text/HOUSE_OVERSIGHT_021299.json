  "text": "between lower-level physical or\nhomeostatic challenges and higher-level\npsychological and social stressors. Basic\nhomeostatic reflexes, reflexes that keep\nin balance various critical bodily\nprocesses such as blood pressure, body\ntemperature, and blood sugar, are largely\nhard-wired and organized at relatively\nlow levels of the nervous system, such as\nthe brainstem and spinal cord. An\nexample comes from autonomic nervous\nsystem regulation of cardiovascular\nfunction. The sympathetic division of the\nautonomic nervous system is an\nactivational, energy mobilization system\nthat comes into play in the face of\nadaptive challenges. Sympathetic\nactivation increases heart rate and results\nin peripheral vasoconstriction, both of\nwhich tend to increase blood pressure. In\ncontrast, the parasympathetic division is\nan energy-conserving, deactivational\nbrake that generally opposes the\nsympathetic system, yielding decreases\nin heart rate and blood pressure. The\nbaroreceptor heart rate reflex is a\nhomeostatic reflex that functions to\nmaintain blood pressure within\nhomeostatic limits. Unique pressure\nsensitive receptors in the heart and large\narteries detect changes in blood pressure,\nand a decrease in blood pressure triggers\nthe baroreceptor heart rate reflex,\nincreasing sympathetic activity and\nreciprocally decreasing parasympathetic\ntone. Both effects serve to increase heart\nrate (and thus cardiac output) and\nconstrict arteries throughout the body,\nthereby restoring the pressure\nperturbation. In basic reflexes, the two\nautonomic branches are generally\nregulated in this reciprocal fashion, and\nthus synergistically amplify the effects\nof the other. This is a useful mechanism\nto adjust to severe adaptive challenges\n\nPage |53\n\nsuch as a decrease in blood pressure and\ncompromised circulation.\n\nAlthough this reciprocal mode of\nregulation of the autonomic branches has\nconsiderable utility, and is characteristic\nof basic reflex organizations, it may not\nalways be optimal. The autonomic\nnervous system provides the basic\nsupport for action and adjustment, and\nalthough it figures prominently in\nsurvival related functions, it also\nprovides the basic visceral support for\nemotional and cognitive operations as\nwell. It has long been recognized that\ncognitively demanding tasks elicit\ngreater autonomic activation than is\nneeded to meet the metabolic demands\nof the tasks. Moreover, ascending neural\nsignals to the brain from visceral organs\nsuch as the heart and blood vessels serve\nto modulate and regulate cognitive\nactivities (5). The notable early\npsychologist, William James, proposed\nthat emotion is the experience of\nsomatovisceral sensory feedback. James\nsuggested that we do not run from the\nbear because we are afraid, but rather we\nare afraid because we run from the bear\n(6). Although the strong form of this\ntheory has not been supported, it remains\nthe case that ascending visceral signals\ncan modulate learning, attention, and\ncortical/cognitive processing (5). The\nautonomic nervous system is not only\nfor lower level reflexive adjustments.\nIndeed, it is increasingly recognized that\nthere is a highly complex, even intricate,\ninteraction between the autonomic\nnervous system and higher level brain\nstructures (e.g., frontal cortex) involved\nin human behavior. Importantly, these\ncircuits and their interactions with the\nautonomic nervous system are highly\nflexible and are not constrained by the\nsimple organization rules that govern\nbasal functions such as homeostasis and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021299",
