  "text": "You don’ t see many porn sites that feature intercourse with\ncorpses, and if you do, how do you know they’ re really dead? But, say\nwhat you will about California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, you have\nto give him credit for signing a bill to forbid necrophilia. Under the new\nlaw, sex with a corpse is now a felony punishable by up to eight years in\nprison.\n\nAge is no barrier. The state’ s first attempt to outlaw necrophilia--in\nresponse to a case of a man charged with having sex with the corpse of a\n4-year-old girl in Southern California---stalled in a legislative committee,\nbut the bill was revived after an unsuccessful prosecution of a man who\nwas found in a San Francisco funeral home, passed out on top of an\nelderly woman’ s corpse.\n\nNecrophiliacs have been getting away with it all this time, but\ndistrict attorneys will no longer be stymied by the lack of an official ban.\nAccording to Tyler Ochoa, a professor at Santa Clara University of Law who\nhas studied California cases involving allegations of necrophilia,\n\n“Prosecutors didn’ t have anything to charge these people with other\nthan breaking and entering. But if they worked in a mortuary in the first\n\nplace, prosecutors couldn’ t even charge them with that.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015355",
