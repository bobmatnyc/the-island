Summary Financial Information and Projections Discussion\n\nThe table below shows KLC PropCo pro forma historical results for 2005 assuming the division of KLC\nOpCo and KLC PropCo in the series of transactions completed in November 2005 (the “Real Estate\nTransactions”) and related financing, together with the lease of KLC PropCo-owned centers to KLC OpCo,\noccurred on January 1, 2004. Projected results presented below are based on assumptions management\nbelieves to be reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and may not be realized. KLC PropCo’s\nability to perform as projected depends on a number of variables that cannot be predicted with certainty\nand actual performance could be adversely affected by a number of factors, including those described in\n“Risk Factors,” particularly the risk factor related to projected financial statements, elsewhere in this\nMemorandum.
