  "text": "Presentation Premise\n\nFor America to remain the great country it has been for the past 235 years,\nit must determine the best ways to honor the government’s fundamental\nmission derived from the Constitution:\n\n...to form a more perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic tranquility,\nprovide for the common defense, promote the general welfare and secure the\nblessings of liberty to ourselves and our posterity.\n\nTo this end, government should aim to help create a vibrant environment for\neconomic growth and productive employment. It should manage its operations\nand programs as effectively and efficiently as possible, improve its financial\nposition by driving the federal government's income statement to long-term\nbreak-even, and reduce the unsustainable level of debt on its balance sheet.\n\nKP\ni USA Inc. | Introduction 7\n\nUSA Inc. Concept\n\nHealthy financials and compelling growth prospects are key to success for businesses\n(and countries). So if the US federal government — which we call USA Inc. — were a\nbusiness, how would public shareholders view it? How would long-term investors evaluate\nthe federal government's business model, strategic plans, and operating efficiency? How\nwould analysts react to its earnings reports? Although some 45%1 of American households\nown shares in publicly traded companies and receive related quarterly financial statements, not\nmany “stakeholders” look closely at Washington’s financials. Nearly two-thirds of all American\nhouseholds? pay federal income taxes, but very few take the time to dig into the numbers of the\nentity that, on average, collects 13%? of all Americans’ annual gross income (not counting\nanother 15-30% for payroll and various state and local taxes).\n\nWe drill down on USA Inc.’s past, present, and (in some cases) future financial dynamics and\nfocus on the country’s income statement and balance sheet and related trends. We isolate and\nreview key expense and revenue drivers. On the expense side, we examine the major\nentitlement programs (Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security) as well as defense and other\nmajor discretionary programs. On the revenue side, we focus on GDP growth (driven by labor\nproductivity and employment in the long run) and tax policies.\n\nWe present basic numbers-driven scenarios for addressing USA Inc.'s financial challenges. In\naddition, we lay out the type of basic checklists that corporate turnaround experts might use as\nstarting points when looking at some of USA Inc.’s business model challenges.\n\nSource: 1) 2008 ICI (Investment Company Institute) / SIFMA (Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association) Equity\n\nand Bond Owners Survey; 2) Number of tax returns with positive tax liability (91MM) divided by total number of returns filed (142MM), per Tax Foundation\ncalculations based on IRS data; 3) Total federal income taxes (ex. payroll taxes) paid divided by total adjusted gross income, per IRS 2007 data.\nwww.kpcb.com\n\nUSA Inc. | Introduction 8\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020845",
