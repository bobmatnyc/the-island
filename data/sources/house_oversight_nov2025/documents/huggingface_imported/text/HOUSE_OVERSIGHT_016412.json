  "text": "different from this cellular-automaton system. The difference is a detailed difference.\nThis brainlike neural network was produced by the long history of civilization, whereas\nthe cellular automaton was created by my computer in the last microsecond.\n\nThe problem of abstract AI is similar to the problem of recognizing\nextraterrestrial intelligence: How do you determine whether or not it has a purpose? This\nis a question I don’t consider answered. We’ll say things like, “Well, AI will be\nintelligent when it can do blah-blah-blah. ” When it can find primes. When it can\nproduce this and that and the other. But there are many other ways to get to those results.\nAgain, there is no bright line between intelligence and mere computation.\n\nIt’s another part of the Copernican story: We used to think Earth was the center of\nthe universe. Now we think we’re special because we have intelligence and nothing else\ndoes. I’m afraid the bad news is that that isn’t a distinction.\n\nHere’s one of my scenarios. Let’s say there comes a time when human\nconsciousness 1s readily uploadable into digital form, virtualized and so on, and pretty\nsoon we have a box of a trillion souls. There are a trillion souls in the box, all virtualized.\nIn the box, there will be molecular computing going on—maybe derived from biology,\nmaybe not. But the box will be doing all kinds of elaborate stuff. And there’s a rock\nsitting next to the box. Inside a rock, there are always all kinds of elaborate stuff going\non, all kinds of subatomic particles doing all kinds of things. What’s the difference\nbetween the rock and the box of a trillion souls? The answer is that the details of what’s\nhappening in the box were derived from the long history of human civilization, including\nwhatever people watched on YouTube the day before. Whereas the rock has its long\ngeological history but not the particular history of our civilization.\n\nRealizing that there isn’t a genuine distinction between intelligence and mere\ncomputation leads you to imagine that future—the endpoint of our civilization as a box of\ntrillion souls, each of them essentially playing a video game, forever. What is the\n“purpose” of that?\n\n192\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016412",
