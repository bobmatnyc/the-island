Browning, an attorney duly admitted to practice before the Courts of the State of\nNew York, affirms the following under penalties of perjury:\n1. I am an associate of Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, attorneys for non-party movant\nNYP Holdings, Inc., publisher of the New York Post (the \"Post\") and I submit this affirmation in\nsupport of the Post's motion to unseal the briefs filed by the parties in the above-captioned\nappeal.\n2. The grounds for unsealing the appeal briefs in this action are set forth in the\naccompanying memorandum of law. I submit this affirmation to annex relevant documents and\nto state facts that are relevant to this motion, of which I have personal knowledge.\n3. Annexed hereto as Exhibit A is a true and correct copy of an article written by\nJulie K. Brown and published by the Miami Herald on November 28, 2018, entitled \"Cops\nworked to put serial sex abuser in prison. Prosecutors worked to cut him a break.\"\n4. Annexed hereto as Exhibit B is a true and correct copy of an article written by\nRebecca Rosenberg and Danika Fears, which was published by the Post on January 7, 2015,\nentitled \"DA's office 'went easy' on sex offender Epstein.\"\n4840-5788-8644v. I 3930033-000039\n5. Annexed hereto as Exhibit C is a true and correct copy of an article written by\nRebecca Rosenberg, Larry Celona, Susan Edelman and Isabel Vincent, which was published by\nthe Post on December 1, 2018, entitled \"Manhattan DA sided with pedophile billionaire after\nbotching investigation.\"\n6. On or about December 4, 2018, Post reporter Susan Edelman contacted Danny\nFrost, Director of Communications for Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., and\nrequested copies of the briefs filed by the District Attorney's office in the above-captioned\nappeal. Ms. Edelman stated that names of victims could be redacted before the briefs were\ndisclosed.\n7. Mr. Frost responded that he could not provide Ms. Edelman with copies of the\nbriefs because they were filed under seal pursuant to N.Y. Civil Rights Law 50-b and that the\nDistrict Attorney's office could only release the briefs, even with victims' names redacted, if this\nCourt ordered the briefs to be unsealed.\n8. Mr. Frost further indicated by email that \"[i]f the Post petitions the court, and the\ncourt asks the People for our position, we will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief'\n(emphasis in original). A true and correct copy of that email correspondence is annexed hereto\nas Exhibit D.\n9. On or about December 18, 2018, I contacted Jay Lefkowitz, who represented\nappellant Jeffi-ey Epstein in the above-captioned appeal. Mr. Lefkowitz told me that he no\nlonger represents Mr. Epstein and referred me to Martin Weinberg, who currently acts as counsel\nfor Mr. Epstein.\nI 0.\nOn or about December 20, 2018, I spoke with Mr. Weinberg and explained the\nnature of the Post's motion to unseal the redacted briefs and the position taken by the Manhattan\n4840-5788-8644v. I 3930033-000039\nDistrict Attorney. Mr. Weinberg told me that he was unable to take a position on the Post's\nmotion without first reviewing it and reserved the right to file an opposition, if necessary.\n11. On December 21, 2018, the Post filed a motion requesting an order unsealing the\nappellate briefs and directing the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to produce copies with\nthe names of victims redacted (the \"December 21 Motion\").\n12. On or about December 28, 2018, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office filed an\naffirmation in response to the Post's motion, signed by Assistant District Attorney Karen\nFriedman Agnifilo and dated December 28, 2018 (the \"DA Affirmation\"). A true and correct\ncopy of the Affirmation is annexed hereto as Exhibit E.\n13. On January 2, 2019, I spoke with Ms. Friedman Agnifilo to discuss the DA\nAffirmation. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo told me that there had been a miscommunication by Mr.\nFrost and that the District Attorney's Office did oppose the December 21 Motion. Ms. Friedman\nAgnifilo also told me that, in the view of the District Attorney's Office, the Post should give\nnotice of their motion to unseal the appeal briefs to the prosecutors in Florida that handled the\nprosecution that led to Mr. Epstein's conviction for solicitation of prostitution from a minor. The\nPost disagrees with that position but nevertheless decided to moot any procedural issues related\nto requirements to notify the Florida prosecutors. Ms. Friedman Agnifilo subsequently informed\nme that the agency in Florida responsible for Mr. Epstein's prosecution was the Palm Beach\nCounty State Attorney's Office.\n14. On January 3, 2019, I received an email from Mr. Weinberg stating that \"after\nconsideration of your request for the unsealing of the appellate briefs with redactions of certain\nidentities, we take no position on behalf of Mr. Epstein.\" A true and correct copy of that email is\nannexed hereto as Exhibit F.\n4840-5788-8644v. l 3930033-000039\n15. On January 4, 2019, the Post filed a letter with this Court voluntarily withdrawing\nthe December 21 Motion without prejudice to refile in order to moot the procedural issues raised\nby the Manhattan District Attorney's Office with respect to furnishing notice to prosecutors in\nFlorida. A true and correct copy of that letter is annexed as Exhibit G.\n16. On or about January 10, 2019, I contacted the Palm Beach County State\nAttorney's Office to inform it of the Post's intention to file a motion to unseal the appellate\nbriefs and to inquire about where to send a copy of the motion. A member of the Office of State\nAttorney David Aronberg instructed me to send a digital copy of the motion to e­\npostconviction@sa15.org and to send a paper copy to the State Attorney's main offices.\n17. On or about January 10 and January 11, 2019, I spoke with Sarah J. Schall,\nSpecial Counsel to the U.S. Attorney in the Southern District of Florida, to inform her Office of\nthe Post's intention to file a motion to unseal the appellate briefs and to inquire about where to\nsend a copy of the motion. Ms. Schall instructed me to send a digital copy of the motion papers\nto her email address and to forward hard copies to Dexter Lee.\nDated: New York, New York\nJanuary 11, 2019\n4840-5788-8644v.J 3930033-000039\nEXHIBIT A\nCops worked to put serial sex\nabuser in prison.

At the top of the stairwell was a vast master bed and\nbath, with cream-colored shag carpeting and a hot pink and mint green sofa.\nThe room was dimly lit and very cold.\nThere was a vanity, a massage table and a timer.\nA silver-haired man wearing nothing but a white towel came into the room. He\nlay facedown on a massage table, and while talking on a phone, directed Licata to\nrub his back, legs and feet.\nMicelle Licata, is one of the over 100 middle school and high school-aged girls that Palm Beach billionaire, Jeffrey\nEpstein, is accused of sexually assaulting.

Shaking and\npanicked, she mechanically pulled off her jeans and stripped down to her\nunderwear. He set the timer for 30 minutes and then reached over and\nunsnapped her bra. He then began touching her with one hand and masturbating\nhimself with the other.\n\"I kept looking at the timer because I didn't want to have this mental image of\nwhat he was doing,\" she remembered of the massage. \"He kept trying to put his\nfingers inside me and told me to pinch his nipples. He was mostly saying 'just do\nthat, harder, harder and do this ....

The alleged abuse\ndates back to 2001 and went on for years.\nPalm Beach multimillionaire Jeffrey Epstein is a free man, despite sexually abusing dozens of underage girls\naccording to police and prosecutors. His victims have never had a voice, until now.\nBY EMILY MICHOT ill I JULIE K. BROWN ill\nIn 2007, despite ample physical evidence and multiple witnesses corroborating\nthe girls' stories, federal prosecutors and Epstein's lawyers quietly put together a\nremarkable deal for Epstein, then 54. He agreed to plead guilty to two felony\nprostitution charges in state court, and in exchange, he and his accomplices\nreceived immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him\nto prison for life.\nHe served 13 months in a private wing of the Palm Beach County stockade. His\n.alkged co-consP-irators, who helped schedule his sex sessions, were never\nprosecuted.\nThe deal, called a federal non-prosecution agreement, was sealed so that no one\n- not even his victims - could know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and who\nelse was involved.

But after the FBI case was closed\nin 2008, witnesses and alleged victims testified in civil court that there were\nhundreds of girls who were brought to Epstein's homes, including girls from\nEurope, Latin America and former Soviet Republic countries.\nBut Acosta and Epstein's armada of attorneys - Harvard professor Alan\nDershowitz, Jay Lefkowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Jack Goldberger, Roy Black, Guy\nLewis and former Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr - reached a\nconsensus: Epstein would never serve time in a federal or state prison.\nREAD NEXT\nI LOCAL I\nSex abuser Jeffrey Epstein was surrounded by powerful people. Here's a sampling\nNOVEMBER 28, 2018 8:00 AM\n------------- ----·----\n---·--·- --· ----------·-----\nPOLICE UNDER PRESSURE\nThere were really just two people willing to risk their careers to go after Epstein:\nPalm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter and Detective Joseph Recarey.\nFor Reiter, business tycoon Jeffrey Epstein wasn't any more formidable than any\nof the other 8,000 or so wealthy and powerful people living on the island. Police\nhad handled sensational cases involving wealthy residents before - from the\nmurders of heiresses to the rape case involving William Kennedy Smith, of the\nKennedy family.\nThe easternmost town in Florida, Palm Beach is a 10.4-square-mile barrier island\nbetween the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean populated by some of\nthe richest people in the country. President Trump has his \"winter White House\"\nin Palm Beach, and the town makes news as much for its glitz as it does for its\nunusual efforts to preserve its well-mannered image, like banning shirtless\nJoggers.\nBut it was a little surprising, even to Reiter, to learn that one of its residents had a\nrevolving door of middle and high school girls coming to his gated compound\nthroughout the day and night.\nIn their first on-the-record media interviews about the case, Reiter and Recarey\nrevealed new details about the investigation, and how they were, in their view,\npressured by then-Palm Beach State Attorney Barry Krischer to downgrade the\ncase to a misdemeanor or drop it altogether.\nFormer Palm Beach County Police Detective Joe Recarey was the lead detective on the solicitation-of-minors case\nagainst billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.\nEMILY MICHOT EMICHOT@MIAMIHERALD.COM\nBetween March of 2005 -when the case was opened -and seven months later,\nwhen police executed a search warrant at Epstein's home, Recarey had identified\n21 possible victims, according to a copy of the unredacted police report obtained\nby the Herald. By the time police felt they had enough evidence to arrest Epstein\non sex charges, they had identified about 3 5 possible underage victims and were\ntracking down at least a dozen more, the police report said.\n\"I was surprised at how quickly it snowballed. I thought at some point there\nwould be a last interview, but the next victim would supply me with three or four\nmore names and the next one had three or four names and it just kept getting\nbigger and bigger,'' Recarey said.\nBy then, word had gotten back to Epstein from some of the girls that they had\nbeen questioned by police. Epstein hired famed lawyer Alan Dershowitz.\n\"Alan Dershowitz flew down and met privately with Krischer,\" Recarey said. \"And\nthe shenanigans that happened, I don't think I've ever seen or heard of before.\"\nPolice reports show that Epstein's private investigators attempted to conduct\ninterviews while posing as cops; that they picked through Reiter's trash in search\nof dirt to discredit him; and that the private investigators were accused of\nfollowing the girls and their families. In one case, the father of one girl claimed\nhe had been run off the road by a private investigator, police and court reports\nshow.\nSupport investigative journalism\nThe Miami Herald obtained thousands of FBI and court records, lawsuits, and witness depositions, and went to\nfederal court in New York to access sealed documents in the reporting of \"Perversion of Justice.\" The Herald\nalso tracked down more than 60 women who said they were victims, some of whom had never spoken of the\nabuse before.\nYour digital subscription, starting at $0.99 for the first month, supports investigative journalism like this.\nCLICK TO SUBSCRIBE\nSeveral of the girls said they felt intimidated and frightened by Epstein and Sarah\nKellen, the millionaire's assistant and alleged scheduler of massages, who warned\nthem not to talk to police, according to the police report.\nDershowitz, in an interview with the Herald, said he had nothing to do with\ngathering background on the girls - or in directing anyone to follow the police, or\nthe girls and their families.\n\"I'm not an investigator. My only job was to negotiate and try the case when it\ncomes to trial,'' he said.\nHe nevertheless convinced Krischer that the girls would not be credible on the\nwitness stand, according to Reiter and Recarey.\nThe defense team's investigators compiled dossiers on the victims in an effort to\nshow that Epstein's accusers had troubled pasts.\nDershowitz met with Krischer and Recarey, sharing with them the results of an\ninvestigation into one of the girls, described by Dershowitz as \"an accomplished\ndrama student\" who hurled profanities at his investigator at \"a furious pace.\"\n10/27/99 - OPINION - Barry Krischer; P.B.Co. State Attorney. (AM)\n\"Our investigation had discovered at least one of her websites and I am enclosing\nsome examples ... the site goes on to detail, including photos, her apparent\nfascination with marijuana, \" Dershowitz wrote in an undated letter to Recarey.\nHe also disputed the claim that one of the defense team's private investigators\nhad misrepresented himself as a police officer.\nRecarey stood his ground.\n\"His attorneys showed us a MySpace page where one of the-girls was holding a\nbeer in her hand, and they said, 'oh look, she is underage drinking,' \" Recarey\nrecalled. \"Well, tell me what teenager doesn't? Does that mean she isn't a victim\nbecause she drank a beer? Basically, what you're telling me is the only victim of a\nsexual battery could be a nun.\"\nKrischer and the lead state prosecutor on the case, Assistant State Attorney Lanna\nBelohlavek, began to dodge Recarey and Reiter's phone calls and emails, and they\ndragged their feet on approving subpoenas, Reiter and Recarey said.\n\"Early on, it became clear that things had changed, from Krischer saying, 'we'll\nput this guy away for life,' to 'these are all the reasons why we aren't going to\nprosecute this,' \" Reiter said.\nKrischer, who is now retired and in private practice, did not respond to multiple\nrequests from the Herald for comment. Belohlavek also did not respond to an\nemail sent to her office.\n\"It became apparent to me that some of our evidence was being leaked to\nEpstein's lawyers, who began to question everything that we had in our probable\ncause affidavit,\" Reiter said.\nThe day of the search on Oct. 20, 2005, they found that most of Epstein's\ncomputer hard drives, surveillance cameras and videos had been removed from\nthe house, leaving loose, dangling wires, according to the police report.\nBut the girls' description of the house squared with what detectives found, right\ndown to the hot pink couch and the dresser drawer of sex toys in Epstein's\nbathroom.\nReiter said his own trash was disappearing from his house, as his life was put\nunder Epstein's microscope. Private investigators hired by Epstein's lawyers even\ntracked down Reiter's grade school teachers, the former chief said. Questions\nwere raised about donations that Epstein had made to the police department,\neven though Reiter had returned one of the donations shortly after the\ninvestigation began.\nRecarey, meanwhile, said he began to take different routes to and from work, and\neven switched vehicles because he knew he was being tailed.\n\"At some point it became like a cat-and-mouse game. I would stop at a red light\nand go. I knew they were there, and they knew I knew they were there. I was\nconcerned about my kids because I didn't know if it was someone that they hired\njust out of prison that would hurt me or my family,\" Recarey said.\nDespite relentless political pressure, Reiter and Recarey soldiered on, and their\ndetermination yielded evidence that supported most of the girls' allegations, the\nformer cops said. They had phone records that showed Epstein and his assistant,\nKellen, had called many of the girls. Epstein's flight logs showed that the calls\nwere made when Epstein was in Palm Beach.\nThey obtained dozens of message pads from his home that read like a who's who\nof famous people, including magician David Copperfield and Donald Trump, an\nindication of Epstein's vast circle of influential friends. There were also messages\nfrom girls, and their phone numbers matched those of many of the girls Recarey\nhad interviewed, Recarey said. They read: \"Courtney called, she can come at 4,\"\nor \"Tanya can't come at 7 p.m. tomorrow because she has soccer practice.\"\nThey also found naked photographs of underage girls in Epstein's closet, Recarey\nsaid.\nThere were also witnesses: Two of Epstein's butlers gave Recarey sworn\ninterviews, confirming that young girls had been coming and going at the house.\nOne of the butlers, Alfredo Rodri gu ez, told Recarey that when he was tasked with\ncleaning up the master bath after Epstein's sessions with the girls, he often\ndiscovered sex toys. Once, he accidentally stumbled on a high school girl, whom\nhe identified, sleeping naked in Epstein's spa, he testified in a 2009 court\ndeposition.\nRodriguez said he was given the job of paying the girls, telling Recarey that he\nwas \"a human ATM machine\" because he was ordered by Epstein to keep $2,000\non him at all times. He was also assigned to buy the girls gifts. Rodri gu ez gave\nRecarey copies of pages from a book that Epstein and his staff kept with the\nnames and phone numbers for many of the Palm Beach County girls, Recarey\nsaid.\nRodriguez, however, held onto the bulk of Epstein's \"little black book,\" and in\nNovember 2009 tried to sell it for $50,000 to an undercover FBI agent posing as\na victim's lawyer. He was arrested and sentenced in 2012 to federal prison, and\ndied three years later following an illness. The book - listing personal phone\nnumbers for a cavalcade of Epstein's powerful friends and celebrities - eventually\nbecame public as part of a civil lawsuit. It listed more than 100 female names\nand phone numbers under the headings \"massage\" in every city where Epstein\nhad homes.\nIn May 2006, Recarey drew up probable cause affidavits, charging Epstein, two of\nhis assistants and one recruiter with sex-related crimes. Instead, Krischer took\nwhat Recarey said was the unusual step of referring the case to a state grand jury.\nEpstein was indicted in state court on a minor charge of solicitation of\nprostitution.\nRecarey said Krischer told him he didn't believe Epstein's accusers, and only two\nof them were called before the state grand jury investigating the case - even\nthough police had lined up more than a dozen girls and witnesses at that time.\nBelieving that the case had been tainted, Reiter - that same month, May 2006 -\ntook a very public stance against Krischer, writing a letter, which was released to\nthe news media, calling on Krischer to remove himself from the case. The chief\nthen referred it to the FBI, which opened its own investigation in July 2006, FBI\nrecords show.\nReiter said he was effectively blackballed in some Palm Beach circles as a result\nof going over Krischer's head, and their relationship, once strong, would never be\nthe same.\nReiter has no regrets about what he did.\n\"There are challenges here that don't exist in a lot of other places because of the\naffluence in the community, but the only way I could approach this case was that\nnone of that matters. The truth is still the truth. The facts are the facts.\nEverybody is treated the same.\"\nIn the years that followed, several of the victims obtained lawyers and filed civil\nlawsuits against Epstein. About two dozen lawsuits were filed, starting in 2008.\nThe early cases were particularly brutal for his victims, the court records show.\nThe girls faced fierce grilling from another pack of Epstein's civil attorneys, who\nquestioned them about their boyfriends, drinking, drug use, social media posts,\ntheir parents and even their medical histories.\nOne girl was asked about her abortions, and her parents, who were Catholic and\nknew nothing about the abortions, were also deposed and questioned.\nLicata said the questions from Epstein's civil lawyers were so intimate that she\nbecame paranoid that people were following her.\n\"His lawyers were just in my life inside and out. They asked if I had a baby, if I\nhad an abortion, 'did you sleep with 30 different guys' and 'do you think that\nplayed a part?' I said, 'you're going to come at me like that when you represent a\nguy who is doing this to hundreds of girls? How do you sleep at night?' \"\nBROOKLYN TO PALM BEACH\nJeffrey Epstein was born in Brooklyn, the son of a New York parks department\nworker. In one of several depositions he gave as part of the lawsuits filed against\nhim, he said he attended the Cooper Union school for the advancement of\nscience and art and then studied physics at New York University. But he never\nobtained a degree, instead going on to teach at the Dalton School, an elite K-12\nprivate academy on Manhattan's Upper East Side. Various news profiles over the\nyears have speculated about how he made his vast fortune, calling him an\n\"International Moneyman of Mystery\" and \"The Talented Mr. Epstein.\"\nHe then struck out on his own, opening J. Epstein & Co. His fortunes improved\nwhen he became a financial advisor for Leslie Wexner, founder of The Limited\nstores and owner of Victoria's Secret brands. Later, Epstein would boast that he\nwould manage the portfolios of only those clients who had $1 billion or\nmore. This much is known: He got his start on Wall Street after being offered a\njob by the father of one of his students. At Bear Steams, he became a derivative\nspecialist, applying complex math formulas and computer algorithms to evaluate\nfinancial data and trends.\nThrough Wexner, he acquired a seven-story stone mansion that is considered the\nlargest private residence in Manhattan - a 21,000-square-foot fortress with\nheated sidewalks that spans the entire block on 71st Street between Fifth and\nMadison Avenues.\nHe also owns a 10,000-acre ranch, named \"Zorro,\" in New Mexico, a private\nisland called \"Little St. James\" in the Virgin Islands, the $13 million house in\nPalm Beach, a Gulfstream jet and, at one point, owned a Boeing 72 7.\n\nVirginia Roberts says she was used as a sex slave for Jeffrey Epstein for years starting at the age of 16. Roberts\nsays that Epstein also lent her out to some of his wealthy, powerful acquaintances for sex.\nCOURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS\nHe has never been in the Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans, largely\nbecause the magazine has never been able to determine the source or the size of\nhis wealth.\nHe has been dogged by questions about his financial dealings. A former business\npartner, Steven Hoffenberg, sued him in 2016, claiming that Epstein was the\nmastermind behind a $500 million Ponzi scheme that Hoffenberg was\nimprisoned for in 1995. Hoffenberg served 18 years for the scam, but he later\ndropped the lawsuit against Epstein.\nIn August, two of Hoffenberg's former investors rekindled the lawsuit against\nEpstein, but the case was dropped in October.\nEpstein and his associate, British-born socialite Ghislaine Maxwell, were also\naccused in a 2015 federal civil suit of organizing underage sex parties on his\nprivate plane, nicknamed \"The Lolita Express,\" and at Epstein's various homes.\nMaxwell, who has never been charged with wrongdoing, has denied allegations\nmade in the lawsuit that she was Epstein's \"madam.\" The suit, filed by victim\nVirginia Roberts, was settled in 2017.\nVirginia Roberts was working at Mar-a-Lago when she was recruited to be a masseuse to Palm Beach hedge fund\nmanager Jeffrey Epstein. She was lured into a life of depravity and sexual abuse.\nBY EMILY MICHOT II I JULIE K. BROWN II\nIt was Epstein's contacts with powerful and famous people that first propelled him\ninto the public spotlight. In 2002, he flew former President Bill Clinton, actor\nKevin Spacey, comedian Chris Tucker and others to South Africa on his private jet\nas part of a fact-finding AIDS mission in support of the Clinton Foundation.\nBut Epstein, a Clinton donor who contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars to\nDemocratic candidates and causes, realized that his Democratic connections\nweren't going to help him in 2006, when the federal prosecutor was Acosta, a\nconservative Republican appointed during the George W. Bush administration.\nENTER KENNETH STARR\nEpstein's tactic: hire the most aggressive and politically connected lawyers that his\nmoney could buy.\nAt the top of his list: Kenneth Starr, a Republican icon because of his pursuit of\nBill Clinton during the Whitewater investigation, which led to the impeachment\n(but not conviction) of the president after it was revealed he'd had sex with a\nyoung White House intern. Like Acosta, Starr had worked at the prestigious law\nfirm Kirkland & Ellis. Epstein also tapped Jay Lefkowitz, also of Kirkland, who\nworked as a domestic policy advisor and later as a special envoy to North Korea\nduring the George W. Bush presidency.\n\nIndependent Counsel Kenneth Starr speaks to the San Antonio Bar Association in San Antonio, Friday\nafternoon, May 1, 1998.

He left the U.S. Attorney's Office on Jan. 1, 2008,\nand went to work representing Epstein's employees on Jan. 2, 2008, court records\nshow. In 2011, Reinhart was named in the Crime Victims' Rights Act lawsuit,\nwhich accused him of violating Justice Department policies by switching sides,\nimplying that he leveraged inside information about Epstein's investigation to\ncurry favor with Epstein.\nReinhart, in a sworn declaration attached to the CVRA case, denied the\nallegation, saying he did not participate in Epstein's criminal case and \"never\nlearned any confidential, non-public information about the Epstein matter.\"\nThe U.S. Attorney's Office has since disputed that, saying in court papers that he\ndid possess confidential information about the case.\nContacted for this story, Reinhart, in an email, said he never represented Epstein\n- only Epstein's pilots; his scheduler, Sarah Kellen; and Nadia Marcinkova,\ndescribed by some victims as Epstein's sex slave. Reinhart also pointed out that a\ncomplaint filed against him by victims' lawyer Paul Cassell was dismissed by the\nJustice Department.\nBruce E. Reinhart, Member, McDonald Hopkins LLC. (PRNewsFoto/McDonald Hopkins LLC)\nPR NEWSWIRE\nThat same year, 2011, more girls continued to come forward, including Roberts,\nwho claimed in a British tabloid story that Epstein directed her - while she was\nunderage by Florida standards - to have sex, not only with him, but with other\npowerful men, including his attorney, Alan Dershowitz, and Prince Andrew.\nDershowitz and Andrew denied her claims, but after she filed a sworn affidavit in\nfederal court in Miami, the ensuing news media firestorm forced Acosta, then\ndean of the law school at Florida International University, to explain why he'd\ndeclined to prosecute Epstein.\nIn a written, public statement on March 20, 2011, Acosta asserted that the deal\nhe struck with Epstein's lawyers was harsher than it would have been had the case\nremained with the state prosecutor, Krischer, who favored charging Epstein with\nonly a misdemeanor prostitution violation.\nAcosta also described what he called a \"year-long assault\" on prosecutors by\nEpstein's \"army of legal superstars\" who, he said, investigated individual\nprosecutors and their families, looking for \"personal peccadilloes\" to disqualify\nthem from Epstein's case.\nDershowitz, in an interview, denied that Epstein's lawyers would ever investigate\nprosecutors.\nDocuments nevertheless show that Acosta not only buckled under pressure from\nEpstein's lawyers, but he and other prosecutors worked with them to contain the\ncase, even as the FBI was uncovering evidence of victims and witnesses in other\nstates, FBI and federal court documents show.\nA 5 3-page federal indictment had been prepared in 2007, and subpoenas were\nserved on several of Epstein's employees, compelling them to testify before a\nfederal grand jury. The court records reveal that emails began to fly back and\nforth between prosecutors and Epstein's legal team. Those emails show that\nfeder�l prosecutors kept acquiescing to Epstein's demands.\nProsecutors allowed Epstein's lawyers to dictate the terms of each deal that they\ndrew up, and repeatedly backed down on deadlines, so that the defense\nessentially controlled the pace of the negotiations, the emails and letters show.\nIt's clear, from emails and other records, that prosecutors spent a lot of time\nfiguring out a way to settle the case with the least amount of scandal. Instead of\ncharging Epstein with a sex offense, prosecutors considered witness tampering\nand obstruction charges, and misdemeanors that would allow Epstein to secretly\nplead guilty in Miami instead of in Palm Beach County, where most of the victims\nlived, thereby limiting media exposure and making it less likely for victims to\nappear at the sentencing.\n\"I've been spending some quality time with Title 18 [the U.S. criminal code]\nlooking for misdemeanors,\" the lead prosecutor, A. Marie Villafana, wrote to\nEpstein's lawyers on Sept. 13, 2007, adding that she was trying to find \"a factual\nbasis\" for one or more non-sex-related crimes to charge him with.\nThe email chain shows that prosecutors sometimes communicated with the\ndefense team using private emails, and that their correspondence referenced\ndiscussions that they wanted to have by phone or in person, so that there would\nbe no paper trail.\n\"It's highly unusual and raises suspicions of something unethical happening when\nyou see emails that say 'call me, I don't want to put this in writing.' There's no\nreason to worry about putting something in writing if there's nothing improper or\nunethical in the case,\" said former federal prosecutor Francey Hakes, who\nworked in the Justice Department's crimes against children unit.\nOn Sept. 24, 2007, another agreement was reached, but Epstein still wasn't\nhappy with it, emails show.\nLefkowitz continued to pressure the U.S. Attorney's Office to keep the agreement\nsecret, even though under the Crime Victims' Rights Act, prosecutors were\nrequired to inform the victims that a plea deal had been signed.\n\"We ... object to your sending a letter to the alleged victims,\" Lefkowitz wrote on\nNov. 28. \" ... Any such letter would immediately be leaked to the press, your\nactions will only have the effect of injuring Mr. Epstein and promoting spurious\ncivil litigation directed at him. We also request that if your office believes that it\nmust send a letter to go to the alleged victims ... it should happen only after Mr.\nEpstein has entered his plea.''\n,,, __\nThe girls who were abused by Jeffrey Epstein and the cops who championed their cause remain angry over what\nthey regard as a gross injustice, while Epstein's employees and those who engineered his non-prosecution\nagreement have prospered.\nBY MARTA OLIVER CRA VIOTIO IS I EMILY MICHOT IS I JULIE K. BROWN B\nBy December, Epstein had still not agreed to a date for his plea hearing, and was\ntechnically in violation of the September agreement, which required him to\nappear in court by November, Acosta noted in a letter to Kenneth Starr in\nDecember 2007.\n\"The [U.S. attorneys] who have been negotiating with defense counsel have for\nsome time complained to me regarding the tactics used by the defense team,\"\nAcosta wrote. \"It appears to them that as soon as resolution is reached on one\nissue, defense counsel finds ways to challenge the resolution collaterally .... Some\nin our office are deeply concerned that defense counsel will continue to mount\ncollateral challenges to provisions to the agreement, even after Mr. Epstein has\nentered his guilty plea and thus rendered the agreement difficult, if not\nimpossible, to unwind.\"\nAnd that's exactly what happened.\nVillafana frequently showed her frustration.\n\"I thought we had worked very well together in resolving this dispute .... I feel\nthat I bent over backwards to keep in mind the effect that the agreement would\nhave on Mr. Epstein,\" Villafana wrote to Epstein attorney Lefkowitz on Dec. 13,\n2007.\nBy then the deal had been signed for two months, and Jeffrey Sloman, Acosta's\ntop assistant, told Lefkowitz he intended to begin notifying Epstein's victims.\nAn indignant Lefkowitz wrote to Acosta: \"You ... assured me that your office\nwould not ... contact any of the identified individuals, potential witnesses or\npotential civil claimants and their respective counsel in this matter.\"\nAs the months went on, with the agreement still in limbo, federal prosecutors\nonce again began to prepare indictments against Epstein, court records show. The\nFBI investigation briefly resumed, and additional witnesses were interviewed in\nNew York and New Mexico, the records show. In January 2008, several Epstein\nvictims were sent letters informing them that the FBI investigation was \"ongoing\"\nas negotiations to finalize the plea bargain continued behind the scenes.\nStarr finally appealed to the Justice Department in Washington, challenging\nfederal jurisdiction of the case, but in May 2008, the Justice Department affirmed\nAcosta's right to prosecute.\n'STILL AFRAID OF EPSTEIN'\nIn recent court filings, the government was forced to answer questions about its\nnegotiations, finally admitting in 2013 that federal prosecutors had backed down\nunder relentless pressure by Epstein's attorneys.\n\"The government admits that, at least in part as a result of objections lodged by\nEpstein's lawyers to victim notifications, the [United States Attorney's Office]\nreevaluated its obligations to provide notification to victims and Jane Doe #l was\nthus not told that the USAO had entered into a non-prosecution agreement with\nEpstein until after it was signed,\" wrote Assistant U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee.\nSaid Hakes, the former federal prosecutor: \"I have never heard of a case where\nfederal prosecutors consult with a defense attorney before they send out standard\nvictim notification letters. To negotiate what the letters would say and whether\nthey would be sent at all suggest that the victims' rights were violated multiple\ntimes.\"\nStarr's aggressive advocacy for Epstein against allegations of improper sexual\nbehavior was in stark contrast to the path he took investigating then-President\nClinton. The Starr Report, the summary of his findings in the Whitewater\ninvestigation, which started as a probe of a land deal gone sour and veered into\nan investigation of sexual misconduct, savaged the president for his involvement\nwith White House intern Monica Lewinsky and was the basis for impeachment.\nStarr himself would face criticism in 2016 - he stepped down as president of\nBaylor University amid allegations that he and other university officials\nmishandled sexual assault allegations brought by female students against\nmembers of the school's football team.\nThe Herald reached out to Starr, through certified letter and through a spokesman\nfor his current law firm, the Lanier Firm, but did not receive a response for this\nstory.\nPalm Beach police detective Recarey, one of the most highly decorated officers on\nthe Palm Beach Police Department, called the Epstein case the most troubling of\nhis 23-year career.\n\\\n\"Some of the victims were - and still are - afraid of Epstein,\" he said as part of\na series of interviews with the Herald earlier this year.\nPrivately, Reiter and Recarey said, they held onto a hope that Epstein would be\nbrought to trial someday, but they said that that notion had faded.\n\"I always hoped that the plea would be thrown out and that these teenage girls,\nwho were labeled as prostitutes by prosecutors, would get to finally shed that label\nand see him go to prison where he belongs,\" Recarey said.\nRecarey died in May after a brief illness. He was 50 years old.\nMore from the series\n1 Ho)V a future Trump Cabinet\nmemb�r garYe a $erial ;ex aibusar\nthe deal oi a Hf 2tirn 1e\n\nEXHIBITB\nDA's office 'went easy' on sex offender Epstein\nBy Rebecca Rosenberg and Danika Fears\nJanuary 7, 2015 I 2:38am\n----------\nJeffrey Epstein\nGregory P. Mango\nJeffrey Epstein may be a convicted pedophile and accused sex- slave master - but that didn't stop him from getting some tender loving\ntreatment from the Manhattan DA's Office.\nProsectors went to bat for the billionaire pervert at a 2011 legal hearing, asking a judge to cut the filthy- rich felon a break on the severity of\nhis sex- offender status, according to court documents.\nADA Jennifer Gaffney supported a request by Epstein - who allegedly peddled $15,000-a-night teen \"sex slaves\" to rich men like Britain's\nPrince Andrew - that he only be listed as a Level 1 pervert during a hearing in Manhattan Supreme Court, according to legal transcripts.\nThe sicko investment magnate has just finished serving 13 months of an 18-month sentence in Florida for soliciting a minor girl for\nprostitution. The hearing was to determine what kind of offender status he would have in New York, where he keeps a vacation home.\nThe city ADA argued that since \"there was only an indictment for one victim,\" Epstein shouldn't have to register as Level 3 - which would\nrequire he travel to New York every 90 days and check in with cops.\nJudge Ruth Pickholz was flabbergasted. She couldn't understand why the DA would want to go easy on Epstein, after the New York State\nBoard of Examiners of Sex Offenders recommended the Level 3 status because there was more than just the one victim for which he\npleaded guilty.\n··1 have to tell you, I'm a little overwhelmed because I have never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this,\" the judge said at the\nhearing.\nDespite the DA's arguments, Pickholz slapped Epstein with Level 3 status, which was upheld on appeal.\n·'The strong evidence that the offenses against the other victims did occur outweighs any inferences to be drawn from the manner in which\nthis case was prosecuted in Florida,\" the New York Court of Appeals said in its ruling.\nWhen asked for comment, the DA's Office referred The Post to court documents stating that the prosecution's position was based \"largely\non the mistaken notion\" that only the formal charges against Epstein could be factors in the decision.\nThe jet-setting financier has been making headlines in recent days after Virginia Roberts, 30, claimed he pimped her to Britain's Prince\nAndrew.\nPrince Andrew has denied the accusations against him.\nFILED UNDER JEFFREY EPSTEIN, PRINCE ANDREW, VIRGINIA ROBERTS\nRecommended bv\nEXHIBITC\nMETRO\nManhattan DA sided with pedophile billionaire after\nbotching investigation\nBy Rebecca Rosenberg, Larry Celona. Susan Edelman and Isabel Vincent\nDecember 1. 2018 I 8:47pm I Updated\nJeffrey Epstein\nThe Manhattan DA's office once went to bat for billionaire pervert Jeffrey Epstein, after botching a review of his sex crimes and swallowing\nhis lawyers' claim that \"there are no real victims here,\" records obtained by the Post show.\nAssistant DA Jennifer Gaffney, then-deputy chief of Cyrus Vance Jr.'s sex-crimes unit, in January 2011 asked a Manhattan judge to\ndowngrade Epstein's status in the New York sex-offender registry from the most-dangerous Level 3 to least-restrictive Level 1.\nThe judge was stunned.\n\"I have never seen the prosecutor's office do anything like this,\" Manhattan Supreme Court Justice Ruth Pickholz told Gaffney. ·1 have done\nmany [cases] much less troubling than this one where (prosecutors) would never make a downward argument like this.\"\nPressed by the judge, Gaffney admitted that she never spoke to the Florida U.S. Attorney who handled a sprawling sex-crime investigation\ninto the financier.\n\"I don't think you did much of an investigation here,\" Pickholz said. \"I am shocked.\"\nVance's mishandling of the Epstein hearing has come under new scrutiny after a Miami Herald report last week revealed a secret \"nonprosecution\nagreement\" in Florida that buried evidence Epstein had allegedly pimped out 80 girls and young women to his rich and\npowerful pals.\nThe DA's office insists Vance \"was not aware\" of the hearing until years later and had nothing to do with it.\n\"Our prosecutor made a mistake,\" Vance spokesman Danny Frost said of Gaffney.\nGaffney, a prosecutor working in the Harvey Weinstein probe, left the DA's office in September. She declined to comment.\nA DA insider said the office was unaware of Epstein's secret plea deal in Florida, and never investigated his sexcapades in NYC.\nSome law enforcement sources don't believe Vance had no clue that his office had a sex-offender case involving a Manhattan mogul with\nclose ties to Democrats.\n\"This is very unusual,\" one said. \"There is no way Vance didn't know. The question is why - and who asked for the favor.\"\nThe FBI found Epstein recruited girls as young as 13, many runaways, from Florida, New Mexico, the Caribbean and New York, and paid\nthem for nude massages that often led to sex, the Herald reported. Some girls worked for a Manhattan modeling agency and lived in a\nnearby apartment owned by Epstein.\nBut Miami U.S. Attorney Alexander Acosta - now President Trump's labor secretary - sealed a 53-page federal indictment that could have\nsent Epstein to prison for life, the Herald reported.\nInstead, Acosta let Epstein plead guilty to procuring a person under 18 for prostitution. Sentenced to 18 months, he served just 13 - most of\nit in his tony Palm Beach office.\nEpstein was required to register as a sex offender in New York because one of his many homes is in Manhattan.\nIn the Jan. 18, 2011 hearing, Gaffney argued the evidence didn't justify the harshest status.\n\"There is only an indictment for one victim.,\" she said. \"If an offender is not indicted for an offense, it is strong evidence that the offense did\nnot occur.\"\nPickholz rejected Gaffney's arguments and gave Epstein the highest sex-offender status - Level 3.\nWhen Epstein appealed, Vance's office admitted it had misread the law.\nThe appellate court upheld Pickholz, saying Epstein \"committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls.\" and that the victim in\nhis indictment \"was only one of defendant's many victims.\"\nFILED UNDER\nBILLIONAIRES, DISTRICT ATTORNEYS, JEFFREY EPSTEIN, PEDOPHILES, SEX OFFENDERS\nRecommended bv\nEXHIBITD\nFrom: Frost, Danny <frostd@dany.nyc.gov>\nDate: Thu, Dec 6, 2018 at 5:27 PM\nSubject: RE: request\nTo: Susan Edelman <sedelman@nypost.com>\nHi Sue,\nRegarding your first question: pursuant to Civil Rights Law§ 50-b, our office's practice in appellate sex\ncrimes matters is to file documents under seal.

Civil Rights Law§ 50-b(2)(b), for an order unsealing the briefs\nfiled by the parties in the above-captioned appeal (the \"Appeal\") with the names of victims of\nsex crimes redacted.\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT\nThe Post seeks to unseal court documents that will shed light on why the Manhattan\nDistrict Attorney's Office initially sought lenient treatment of billionaire financier and convicted\npedophile Jeffrey Epstein. In 2008, Epstein pled guilty to soliciting prostitution from a minor,\nbut there has been suspicion since that time - voiced by members of the judiciary and the press\nalike - that prosecutors gave Epstein preferential treatment because of his wealth and his\npolitical connections to powerful men like Donald Trump, Bill Clinton, and Prince Andrew. The\nhandling of criminal proceedings against Epstein by federal prosecutors in Florida and thereafter\nby the Manhattan District Attorney's office has come under renewed scrutiny after the Miami\nHerald published a series of investigative articles beginning November 28, 2018, including an\narticle reporting recently that \"prosecutors worked to cut him a break\" despite strong evidence\nthat he had abused 80 girls and young women.\nAs part of its own news reporting on the New York proceedings against Epstein, the Post\nseeks to unseal the briefs filed in this Appeal, in which this Court held that Epstein had to\nregister as a level three sex offender in New York, which is the category reserved for highest-risk\noffenders. See People v. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d 570, 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d 239,240 (1st Dep't 2011).\nDuring the Appeal, Epstein argued that his sex offender status should be downgraded to a lower\nlevel while the District Attorney's Office argued that the level-three designation was appropriate.\n481 l•3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039\nThe District Attorney's position on appeal, however, was in stark contrast to what it argued in\nproceedings before the lower court, which was that Epstein \"should be adjudicated a level one\noffender\" (i.e., lowest risk) in spite of the damning evidence establishing that \"defendant\ncommitted multiple offenses against a series of underage girls.\" Id. at 570-71, 933 N.Y.S.2d at\n240. The public has the right to know why the Manhattan District Attorney's Office switched its\nlegal position on appeal and what justifications it advanced in its brief to explain its initial\nrequest for lenient treatment of Epstein. Similarly, the briefing submitted by Epstein, which\nconfronted the District Attorney's arguments on appeal, may shed additional light on why the\nDistrict Attorney changed course on appeal. Despite the obvious public interest in knowing this\ninformation, the briefs were filed wholly under seal pursuant to New York Civil Rights Law\nsection 50-b - which protects the anonymity of sex abuse victims - and not a single word of\neither party's briefs is available to the public.\nSince the District Attorney's Office has made it clear that it will not release any portion\nof any of the appellate briefs filed in this action without clear instructions from this Court, the\nPost respectfully requests an order unsealing the briefs and directing the District Attorney to\nprovide the Post with copies redacted only to the extent necessary to preserve the anonymity of\nvictims. As a threshold matter, the Rules of this Court and the common law both guarantee the\nPost's right to move this Court for an order unsealing court documents (POINT I, supra). And\nthe Post easily demonstrates the \"good cause\" required to overcome sealing of documents under\nsection 50-b. Simply put, the presumption of openness that governs judicial proceedings in this\nState is at its zenith because the documents sought by the Post are highly relevant to allegations\nof prosecutorial missteps and favoritism by the office of the District Attorney in a case involving\na powerful sex offender (POINT II, supra). The Post is mindful, however, of the importance of\n481 l-3721-9459vJ 3930033-000039\nmaintaining anonymity for the victims of sexual assault and respectfully requests that this Court\nalso direct the District Attorney's Office to redact the names of any victims before serving the\nPost with copies of the redacted appellate briefs. The Post further requests that this Court order\nthe District Attorney's Office to provide the Post with copies of the redacted briefs within seven\ndays of entry of its order granting this motion.\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nA. Epstein's Conviction for Sex Crimes and Designation as a Level Three Sex Offender\nIn June 2008, a Florida Court sentenced Jeffrey Epstein to eighteen months in prison after\nhe pleaded guilty to soliciting prostitution from a fourteen-year-old girl. Affirmation of John M.\nBrowning dated December 21, 2018 (\"Browning Aff.\"), Ex. A.\nAfter serving thirteen months of his sentence, Epstein was released and required to\nregister as a sex offender in New York, where he owned property and sought to reside. Id. Ex.\nB. The New York State Board of Examiners of Sex Offenders (\"NYBSO\") recommended that\nEpstein be designated a level three sex offender - which is the level reserved for the most\ndangerous sexual predators - because investigators in Florida had found compelling evidence\nthat Epstein had abused scores of underage girls, despite only pleading guilty to solicitation of a\nsingle minor. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240.\nRemarkably, New York Assistant District Attorney Jennifer Gaffney ignored the NYBSO\nrecommendation and asked the trial court tasked with deciding Epstein's sex-offender status to\ndesignate him as a level one offender only, which is the least-restrictive category possible and is\ntypically applied to offenders who pose the lowest risk of committing further crimes. Id. ADA\nGaffney argued that, since \"there was only an indictment for one victim,\" Epstein should not be\nplaced under the heavy scrutiny required for the most dangerous class of abusers. Id. Ex. B. For\n48l l-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n,..\ntheir part, Epstein's lawyers argued that the lowest designation should be applied because \"there\nare no real victims here.\" Id. Ex. C.\nIn January 2011, the judge presiding over the sex-offender registration proceedings,\nJustice Ruth Pickholz, rejected ADA Gaffney's arguments and designated Epstein as a level\nthree sex offender. Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at 570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. At a hearing preceding her\nruling, Justice Pickholz told the Assistant District Attorney that she had \"never seen the\nprosecutor's office do anything like this\" and further stated that she had \"done many [cases]\nmuch less troubling than this one where [prosecutors] would never make a downward argument\nlike this.\" Id. Ex. B. When ADA Gaffney was questioned about whether she knew Epstein had\nsexually abused other minors, Gaffney admitted that she had never spoken to the federal\ninvestigators in Florida who had reached the conclusion that Epstein was a serial abuser of\nunderage girls. Id. Ex. C.\nB. The Appeal\nEpstein subsequently commenced this Appeal, seeking to overturn the trial court's ruling\nthat he is a level three sex offender. The appellate briefs submitted by Epstein and the\nManhattan District Attorney were filed under seal, pursuant to New York Civil Rights Law\nsection 50-b. Id. ,i 7. That statute protects the anonymity \"of any victim of a sex offense\" by\nrequiring any \"court file ... which tends to identify such a victim\" to be filed under seal. N.Y.\nCiv. Rights Law § 50-b(l ). The statute further provides, however, that court documents filed\nunder seal shall be disclosed if a movant \"demonstrates to the satisfaction of the court that good\ncause exists for disclosure to that person.\" Id. § 50-b(2)(b).\nIn a decision filed on the public docket (the \"Decision\"), this Court affirmed Epstein's\nlevel three offender status because the lower \"court properly relied on highly reliable proof of\ncriminal conduct for which defendant was neither indicted nor convicted.\" Epstein, 89 A.D.3d at\n481 l-3721-9459v 3 3930033-000039\n4\n570, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240. Specifically, the \"evidence ... established that [Epstein] committed\nmultiple offenses against a series of underage girls,\" who \"were brought to [Epstein's] home to\nprovide 'massages' that led to very serious sex crimes.\" Id. at 570-71, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 240.\n_\nAlthough the Manhattan District Attorney's briefing remains under seal, the Decision\nindicates that \"the People [took] a different position on appeal from the position they took before\nthe hearing court.\" Id. at 571, 933 N.Y.S.2d at 241. This Court did not, however, unseal any of\nthe appeal briefs or provide a detailed summary of the parties' respective arguments. The public\nand the press are thus left in the dark as to what exactly the District Attorney's Office and\nEpstein wrote in their respective appeal briefs. It appears that the District Attorney's Office may\nhave taken the position that ADA Gaffney had \"mistakenly conceded [before the lower court]\nthat the conduct for which defendant was not indicted should not be considered, and that\ndefendant should be adjudicated a level one offender.\" Id. at 572,933 N.Y.S.2d at 241. The\nDecision also states that this Court rejected Epstein's argument that the District Attorney \"should\nbe estopped \" from changing position on appeal and also rejected Epstein's \"remaining claims \" as\nbeing \"improperly raised for the first time on appeal.\" Id. The public has the right to know more\nthan these sketchy details, however, particularly when the arguments advanced by the parties on\nappeal clearly discuss the decision taken by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to abruptly\nchange its earlier position that Epstein was deserving of lenient treatment.\nC. Media Interest in New York and Florida Prosecutors' Lenient Handling of Epstein's\nCase\nThe handling of Epstein's prosecution in Florida and the subsequent sex offender\nregistration proceeding against in him New York have both been the subject of legitimate public\ninterest and intense controversy. In the Florida proceedings, the prosecutors were criticized for\nallowing Epstein to enter into a seemingly favorable plea deal. For instance, as the Post reported\n48 \\ l-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039\nat the time, the Florida judge sentencing Epstein \"was critical of two of the deal's conditions,\nindicating she thought he was getting special treatment by being allowed private counselling for\nhis sex offender treatment and to serve time in county jail instead of state prison.\" Samuel\nGoldsmith, Jeffrey Epstein Pleads Guilty to Prostitution Charges, N.Y. POST (June 30, 2008),\navailable at https ://nypost.com/2008/06/30/j effrey-epstein-pleads-guilty-to-prostitu ti on-charges/.\nAnother serious concern was that Epstein's status as a billionaire investor with powerful\nconnections - including close relationships with Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and Prince Andrew\n- may have influenced prosecutors to give Epstein unduly favorable treatment and to tum a blind\neye to the extent of his sexual abuse of minors. Id.\nThere has also been critical reporting on how the Manhattan District Attorney's Office\nhandled Epstein's sex offender registration hearings in New Yark. After the Post obtained\ncopies of the transcript of the status hearing before Justice Pickholz, it published an article on\nJanuary 7, 2015, entitled \"DA's office 'went easy' on sex offender Epstein.\" Id. Ex. B. In that\narticle, the Post reported that \"Prosecutors went to bat for the billionaire pervert at a 2011 legal\nhearing, asking a judge to cut the filthy-rich felon a break on the severity of his sex-offender\nstatus .... \" Id. In addition to reporting the contents of the hearing transcript, Post reporters also\nsought to discover why the District Attorney initially sought lenient treatment for Epstein and, as\npart of its investigation, reached out for comment from the District Attorney's Office. As the\narticle reported, the spokesman for the District Attorney did not give a detailed response on the\nrecord but referred the Post instead to the portion of the Decision stating \"that the prosecution's\nposition was based 'largely on the mistaken notion' that only the formal charges against Epstein\ncould be factors in the decision.\" Id. The Post was unable to obtain copies of the briefs filed\n4811-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039\nwith the First Department- which would provide a more fulsome explanation of the District\nAttorney's position - because those documents remained under seal.\nThe prosecution of Epstein has remained in the news and was recently the subject of a\nwide-ranging mvestigation by the Miami Herald, which was published on November 28, 2018.\nId. Ex. A. One of several in-depth feature articles published by the Miami Herald was entitled\n\"Cops worked to put serial sex abuser in prison. Prosecutors worked to cut him a break.\" Id. In\nthat article, the Miami Herald reported that investigators uncovered evidence that Epstein had\nabused \"over 100 middle school and high school aged girls,\" but \"despite ample physical\nevidence and multiple witnesses corroborating the girls' stories, federal prosecutors and\nEpstein's lawyers quietly put together a remarkable deal for Epstein.\" Id. Epstein agreed to\nplead guilty to soliciting an underage prostitute \"in state court, and in exchange, he and his\naccomplices received immunity from federal sex-trafficking charges that could have sent him to\nprison for life. Id. More troubling still, Epstein's case file was sealed- including a detailed\ncriminal complaint- so that \"no one ... could know the full scope of Epstein's crimes and who\nelse was involved.\" Id.\nThe Miami Herald's reporting has also had serious political ramifications. As the Miami\nHerald has reported, \"[t]he U.S. attorney in Miami, Alexander Acosta, was personally involved\nin the negotiations\" back in and around 2008. Id. Ex. C. Acosta subsequently became \"a\nmember of President Donald Trump's cabinet\" and currently serves as the Secretary of Labor.\nId. Since the Miami Herald published its expose, some members of Congress have demanded an\ninvestigation into what led to the slap-on-the-wrist punishment for Jeffrey Epstein. See, e.g.,\nAnthony Man, Florida Democrats want investigation into Trump cabinet member's role in\nhandling Epstein case, SOUTH FLORIDA SUN SENTINEL (Dec. 4, 2018) available at\n48 I I-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039\nhttps://www.sun-sentinel.com/news/politics/f1-ne-jeffrey-epstein-alex-acosta-investigation-\n20181204-story .html.\nThe Post has also persisted with its own investigation into whether the Manhattan District\nAttorney's Office was unduly lenient when it advocated in favor of registering Epstein as a level\none sex offender. On December 1, 2018, the Post published an article entitled \"Manhattan DA\nsided with pedophile billionaire after botching investigation.\" Id. Ex. C. Following up on its\nprior reporting, the Post reported Justice Pickholz's denial of ADA Gaflhey's efforts to register\nEpstein as a level one offender and then asked the District Attorney's Office to account for the\n\"mishandling of the Epstein hearing.\" Id. In response to questions from the Post, the District\nAttorney's Office insisted that ADA Gaffney simply \"made a mistake.\" Id. A spokesman also\nclaimed that Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance \"'was not aware' of the hearing until\nyears later and had nothing to do with it.\" Id. But, as the Post also reported, \"[s]ome law\nenforcement sources don't believe Vance had no clue that his office had a sex-offender case\ninvolving a Manhattan mogul with close ties to Democrats.\" Id.\nUnsealing of the First Department appeal briefs in this case is crucial so that the public\nand the press may more fully understand why Epstein was initially offered level one offender\nstatus despite the overwhelming evidence that he was a serial sexual abuser of children.\nD. The Post's Efforts to Obtain the Appellate Briefing Filed with the First Department\nOn December 4, 2018, Post reporter Sue Edelman contacted the Director of\nCommunications for District Attorney Cyrus Vance, Jr. and requested a copy of the appellate\nbrief filed by the District Attorney's Office. Id. 116-8. In making this request, Edelman\nspecifically stated that the District Attorney's Office could redact the names of any victims of\nsexual abuse before forwarding the brief. Id. Edelman's request was denied, however, because\nthe District Attorney's Office has taken the position that the brief was filed under seal in its\n481 l-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n8\nentirety pursuant to N.Y. Civil Rights Law section 50-b and could not be released- even with\nthe names of victims redacted - without an order from this Court. Id. Nonetheless, the District\nAttorney's Office stated in an email that it would \"not oppose\" the Post's motion requesting that\na redacted brief be produced. Id. Ex. D.\nCounsel for the Post also contacted counsel for Epstein to ascertain his position on the\ndisclosure of the appellate briefs. Id. On December 20, 2018, Mr. Epstein's lawyer stated that\nhe would not take a position until he had an opportunity to review the brief and reserved his right\nto oppose. Counsel for Epstein later informed counsel for the Post that \"after consideration of\nyour request for the unsealing of the appellate briefs with redactions of certain identities, we take\nno position on behalf of Mr. Epstein.\" Id. Ex. F.\nOn December 21, 2019, the Post moved this Court for an order unsealing the appellate\nbriefs and directing the Manhattan District Attorney's Office to produce copies of the briefs with\nthe names of victims redacted (the \"December 21 Motion\"). On January 2, 2019, counsel for the\nPost received an affirmation signed by Assistant District Attorney Karen Friedman Agnifilo,\ndated December 28, 2018, which opposed the December 21 Motion. After telling the Post that it\n\"will not oppose the petition for a redacted brief,\" the District Attorney's Office argued that the\nDecember 21 Motion should be denied on two grounds. First, the District Attorney's office\nfaulted the Post for supposedly failing to \"furnish the requisite notice\" to \"the prosecuting\nagencies for defendant's underlying sex crimes,\" as required by section 50-b of the New York\nCivil Rights Act. Id. Ex. E ,i 2. According to the Manhattan District Attorney, the Post should\nhave notified \"the federal and local prosecutor's offices in Florida, where defendant was\ncharged\" (and presumably not the Manhattan District Attorney's Office). 1\n1\nThe Post firmly disputes the District Attorney's contention -which is not supported by any authority- that section\n50-b requires the Post to serve any prosecutor who touched Epstein's case in Florida in order to unseal documents\n48! l-372!-9459v.3 3930033-000039\nSecond, Assistant District Attorney Friedman Agnifilo objected to unsealing any portion\nof the appellate briefs and wrote that \"we cannot agree ... even to a production of the people's\nbrief with redactions of the names or initials of Epstein's victims.\" Id. ,i 3. She further noted,\nhowever, that \"if this Court is inclined to grant the Post's motion, we would not oppose\nproducing a copy of the People's brief, with substantial redactions necessary to protect the\nidentities of the victims but keeping intact those portions of the brief that recount the procedural\nhistory of the SORA hearing.\" Id.\nAlthough the Post does not agree that section 50-b requires it to notify Florida\nprosecutors of its intention to move this Court to unseal briefs filed by the Manhattan District\nAttorney in a New York sex offenders proceeding, it nonetheless voluntarily withdrew the\nDecember 21 Motion on January 4, 2019 to moot the issue and bypass an easily avoidable\nprocedural dispute. Counsel for the Post has contacted the Palm Beach State Attorney's office\nand the lJ_nited States Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida (collectively, the\n\"Florida Prosecutors\") to apprise them of its intention to refile this motion to unseal the appellate\nbriefs with the names of victims redacted. Id. ,i,i 1 7-18. The Post will also serve the Florida\nProsecutors with copies of this motion.\nHaving mooted the procedural objection raised by the Manhattan District Attorney, the\nPost now refiles its motion respectfully requesting an order unsealing the appellate briefs and\ndirecting the District Attorney's Office to provide the Post with copies - with the names of\nvictims redacted - within seven days of the entry of its order.\nfiled by New York prosecutors in a New York court as part of proceedings to register Epstein as a sex-offender in\nNew York State. The statute requires a movant to furnish notice to \"the public officer ... with the duty of\nprosecuting the offense.\" N.Y. Civ. Rights Law §50-b. Here, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office had \"the\nduty of prosecuting the offense\" on behalf of the People of New York - i.e., the sex-offender registration\nproceedings against Epstein in this State - and there is no question that the Post provided the Manhattan District\nAttorney with adequate notice of the December 21 Motion.\n48 l l-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039\nIO\nARGUMENT\nDespite the Manhattan District Attorney's apparent opposition to releasing any of portion\nof the appellate briefs, good cause exists to unseal briefs with victims' names redacted because\nthe handling of Epstein's designation as a sex offender by New York prosecutors- including the\nappellate arguments regarding that designation - are of paramount public concern and should be\nopen to public scrutiny.\nI. THE POST HAS THE RIGHT TO MOVE THIS COURT FOR AN ORDER\nUNSEALING THE APPELLATE BRIEFING\nAs a threshold matter, the Practice Rules of this Court permit non-parties (like the Post)\nto submit \"[a]pplications for sealing and unsealing documents ... by motion.\" 22 NYCRR\n§ 1250.l(e)(3). The Post's right to petition this Court for an order unsealing the appellate briefs\nis further buttressed by the rule that \"affected members of the media should be given the\nopportunity to be heard\" before a Court takes the drastic step of sealing court proceedings, filings\nor dockets. In re Capital Newspapers Div. of Hearst Corp. v. Moynihan, 125 A.D.2d 34, 38,512\nN.Y.S.2d 266,269 (3d Dep't 1987), aff'd on other grounds, 71 N.Y.2d 263,525 N.Y.S.2d 24\n(1988). See also Mancheski v. Gabe/Ii Grp. Capital Partners, 39 A.D.3d 499,501,835\nN.Y.S.2d 595, 597 (2d Dep't 2007) (\"[P]rior to issuance of an order to seal judicial documents,\nthe court is obligated, where possible, to afford news media an opportunity to be heard.\") (citing\nIn re Herald Co. v. Weisenberg, 59 N.Y.2d 378,383,465 N.Y.S.2d 862, 864 (1983)); Maxim,\nInc. v. Feifer, 145 A.D.3d 516, 43 N.Y.S.3d 313 (1st Dep't 2016) (reversing order denying\nmotion of press entities to intervene for purpose of seeking access to filed motion papers and\nother court records).\nIn addition to guaranteeing the Post's right to move this Court to unseal documents, New\nYork law also requires this Court to make \"specific findings to support its determination\" before\n481 l-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n11\nlimiting public access to judicial records or proceedings. Daily News, L.P. v. Wiley, 126 A.D.3d\n511,515, 6 N.Y.S.3d 19, 24 (1st Dep't 2015) (before sealing records, courts \"must adhere\nstrictly to the procedures set forth in the controlling case law including affording a full\nopportunity by any interested members of the press to be heard, and making specific findings to\nsupport its determination .... [T]rial court[s] ... cannot ... seal evidence and transcripts\nmerely because the parties are consenting to same and the case has obtained notoriety.\").\nTherefore, in the unlikely event that this Court declines to grant the Post's motion to unseal,\neither in part or in toto, the Post respectfully requests that this Court issue a written order setting\nforth the grounds for its decision.\nII.\nGOOD CAUSE EXISTS TO UNSEAL THE APPELLATE BRIEFS\nThe appellate briefs should be disclosed because they are highly relevant to the public's\nunderstanding of whether the Office of the Manhattan District Attorney-whose fundamental\nmission is to protect the people of this State - initially showed undue deference to a dangerous\npedophile, who is unusually rich and well-connected.\nNew York Civil Rights Law section 50-b permits courts to disclose court documents\nrelating to the commission of a sexual offense whenever a showing is made that \"good cause\nexists for disclosure.\" N.Y. Civ. Rights Law§ 50-b. See also 22 NYCCR § 1250.l(e)(3)\n(permitting the \"unsealing [of] court records ... upon good cause shown \"). Good cause clearly\nexists for disclosing the appellate briefs because they contain a full explanation for why the\nDistrict Attorney's Office argued before the lower court that Epstein should be registered as a\nlevel one sex offender before changing position on appeal. See Epstein, 89 A.O. at 571, 933\nN.Y.S.2d at 241. The appellate briefs may also shed light on the extent of\"the evidence ... that\n[Epstein] committed multiple offenses against a series of underage girls,\" which the District\n48 I 1-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n12\nAttorney's Office apparently disregarded or was not aware of in the proceedings before the lower\ncourt. Id.\nNot only are the appellate briefs subject to the strong presumption of openness that\napplies to all judicial documents but there is also an intense public interest in disclosing these\nspecific documents because they will shed light on why the District Attorney's Office initially\ntook the controversial decision to argue in favor of lenient treatment ofEpstein. 2 As Justice\nBurger wrote, \"[p ]eople in an open society do not demand infallibility from their institutions, but\nit is difficult for them to accept what they are prohibited from observing.\" Richmond\nNewspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 572 (1980). \"Only a free and unrestrained press can\neffectively expose deception in government. And paramount among the responsibilities of a free\npress is the duty to prevent any part of the government from deceiving the people ....\" N.Y.\nTimes Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713, 717 (1971) (Black, J. concurring). In short, the\nappellate briefs should be unsealed so that the Post can inform the public about the decisions\ntaken by the District Attorney's Office with respect to Epstein so that the public can decide\nwhether there was anything careless or improper about those decisions.\nThe need for transparency and public understanding of why the District Attorney's Office\nhandled the Epstein case the way it did is heightened by the fact that District Attorney Vance has\nfaced criticism over claims that his office gives favorable treatment to rich and powerful men\n2\nThe presumption ofopenness is grounded in the U.S. and New York Constitutions as well as deeply-entrenched\ncommon law rules that govern this Court. The First Amendment to the United States Constitution and article I,\nsection 8 of the New York State Constitution both recognize the presumptive right of the public and press to access\nand inspect court records. Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 478 U.S. I (1986); Globe Newspaper Co. v.\nSuperior Court, 457 U.S. 596 (1982); In re Associated Press v. Bell, 70 N.Y.2d 32,517 N.Y.S.2d 444 {1987). In\naddition to being well established under the federal and state constitutions, the right of access to court records \"is\nalso firmly grounded in common law principles.\" Danco Labs., Ltd v. Chem. Works of Gideon Richter, Ltd., 274\nA.D.2d 1, 6, 711 N.Y.S.2d 419,423 (1st Dep't 2000)(citing inter alia Nixon v. Warner Commc'ns, Inc., 435 U.S.\n589, 597 {1978)). See also People v. Burton, 189 A.D.2d 532, 535-36, 597 N.Y.S.2d 488, 491-92 (3d Dep't 1993)\n(\"a common-law presumption\" favors public access to court records); In re Application of National Broad. Co., 635\nF.2d 945, 949 (2d Cir. 1980) (\"[T]he common law right to inspect and copy judicial records is beyond dispute.\")\n( citation omitted).\n4811-372 l-9459v. 3 393003 3-000039\n13\naccused of sexual abuse. As the New Yorker reported, DA Vance declined to charge Harvey\nWeinstein with a sex crime in 2015 even though investigators collected ample evidence that he\nhad groped an actress without consent. See Jennie Suk Gersen, Why Didn't the Manhattan DA\nProsecute the Trumps or Harvey Weinstein, NEW YORKER (Oct. 13, 2017) available at\nhttps://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/why-didnt-manhattan-da-cyrus-vance-prosecutethe-trumps-or-harvey-weinstein.\nEven after the emergence of the #Me Too movement and the\nindictment of Harvey Weinstein on rape charges, the Manhattan District Attorney's Office has\ncontinued to face criticism for failing to prosecute the Weinstein case aggressively enough. Id.\nDistrict Attorney Vance is an elected official who wields an immense amount of discretion over\nprosecutions. The people of New York have the right to scrutinize how his office treated this\ncase involving a rich and well-connected sex offender, especially in light of allegations that other\nnotable sexual predators have benefitted from the apparent deference of prosecutors. To put it\nbluntly, the appellate briefs should be released immediately to avoid any impression of\nimpropriety caused by continued secrecy.\nThere is also a strong interest in disclosing the appellate briefs to enable the public to\nreview for itself the arguments that led this Court to issue the Decision affirming Epstein's status\nas a level three sex offender. By ensuring public access to the courts and enabling public\ndiscussion of the functioning of the judiciary, the news media help \"the public to participate in\nand serve as a check upon the judicial process - an essential component in our structure of selfgovernment.\"\nGlobe Newspaper Co., 457 U.S. at 606. As courts have recognized time and\nagain, \"[w]ithout access to the proceedings, the public cannot analyze and critique the reasoning\nof the court.\" Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp. v. FTC, 710 F.2d 1165, 1178 (6th Cir. 1983).\nThus, \"[ o ]penness ... enhances both the basic fairness of[ a] trial and the appearance of fairness\n481 l-372 l-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n14\nso essential to public confidence in the system.\" Press-Enterprise Co. v. Superior Court, 464\nU.S. 501, 508 (1984) (citing Richmond Newspapers, 448 U.S. 569-71). For this reason, the\nappellate briefs should be unsealed so that the public has the benefit of seeing the very\nstatements and arguments that formed the basis of this Court's Decision. It is especially\nimportant to provide a transparent view into these judicial proceedings because suspicions have\nalready been raised about how the District Attorney's Office handled Epstein's case.\nWhen, as here, \"issues of major public importance are involved, the interests of the\npublic as well as the press in access to court records 'weigh heavily' in favor of release.\" Danco,\n274 A.D.2d at 8, 711 N.Y.S.2d at 425 (citation omitted). This constitutional presumption of\nopen access to court records requires \"the most compelling circumstances\" to justify any\nrestriction upon that right. In re Application of Nat 'I Broa d . Co., 635 F .2d at 952. Here, it is\nimpossible to conceive of any circumstances that might justify wholesale sealing of relevant\ncourt documents that are necessary to understand how prosecutors and this Court handled a\nmatter of such intense public concern.\nThe interest of Epstein's victims to remain anonymous can be satisfied by directing the\nDistrict Attorney's Office to redact the names of victims before disclosing the appellate briefs.\nTo be clear, the Post has no interest in identifying victims of sexual assault who wish to remain\nanonymous. It does, however, have a right to know why the Manhattan District Attorney\nabruptly changed position after initially arguing that Epstein should be treated leniently. The\nDistrict Attorney's Office has indicated that it \"would not oppose producing a copy of the\nPeople's brief ... keeping intact those portions of the brief that recount the procedural history of\nthe SORA hearing, the portion of the brief that is seemingly of interest to the Post.\" Browning\nAff. Ex. E. With all due respect to the District Attorney, the Post is simply not in a position to\n4811-3721-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n15\nevaluate whether the proposed redactions are reasonable. Because the Post cannot review any\npart of the briefs, it is impossible for the Post to know whether the information it seeks is in the\nprocedural history section of the People's brief or in other parts of the briefing filed in the\nAppeal. Moreover, courts must order narrow redactions where possible to avoid overbroad\nsealing. See, e.g., Burton, 189 A.D.2d at 535-36, 597 N.Y.S.2d at 491 (requiring courts to\n\"consider less drastic alternatives to sealing the records which would adequately serve the\ncompeting interests\"); Maxim, Inc., 145 A.D.3d at 518, 43 N.Y.S.3d at 316 (\"We recognize that\nit may be easier for the parties and the motion court to seal an entire court record, rather than\nmake a determination on a document by document basis about sealing, but administrative\nconvenience is not a compelling reason to justify sealing.\"). In keeping with this State's strong\npreference against wholesale sealing of documents, section 50-b expressly permits this Court to\nrelease judicial documents after ordering redactions \"as it deems necessary .. . to preserve the\nconfidentiality of the identity of the victim.\" N.Y. Civ. Rights Law§ 50-b. Since the only\ninformation protected by the statute is identity of Epstein's victims, the Post respectfully requests\nan order directing the District Attorney to redact only the names of Epstein's victims. 3\nSince the Post does not seek the names of victims of sexual abuse and agrees that these\nnames should be redacted before the appellate briefs are disclosed, there should be no need under\nthe statute to provide notice \"to the victim or other person legally responsible for the care of the\nvictim.\" N.Y. Civ. Rights Law§ 50-b(2). But to the extent such notice is necessary, the Post is\nunable to notify any of the victims on its own because it has no knowledge of which victims (if\nany) may be identified in the requested documents. If the statute requires victims to be notified\n3\nWithout the benefit of reviewing the appellate briefs, the Post is not in a position to evaluate whether the briefs\ncontain other information that might identify Epstein's victims, such as home addresses. While the Post would not\nobject to the District Attorney's Office making good faith redactions of genuinely identifying information, these\nredactions should be narrowly tailored and no more expansive than is necessary to protect the victims' identities.\n48l l-372l-9459v.3 3930033-000039\n16\neven if their names will not be disclosed, the Post respectfully submits that either the Manhattan\nDistrict Attorney or the Florida Prosecutors should provide notice promptly. To require the Post\nto notify victims itself - without any ability to discover who those victims are - would be an\nabsurd result that defeats the purpose of the unsealing provision of section 50-b, which allows\n\"any person\" to file an application requesting that infonnation be unsealed for \"good cause.''4\nIn sum, the strong presumption of openness that governs New York courts compels the\nconclusion that the appellate briefs in this action must be unsealed (with the names of any\nvictims of a sexual offense redacted).\nCONCLUSION\nFor the reasons set forth above, the Post respectfully requests an order unsealing the\nappellate briefs, which directs the District Attorney to provide counsel for the Post with copies of\nthese documents, with the names of victims redacted, within seven days of the issuance of this\nCourt's unsealing order.\nDated: New York, New York\nJanuary 11, 2018\nRespectfully submitted,\nDAVIS WRIGHT TREMAINE LLP\n/Y1\nBy : U✓2:\nRobert D.
