THOMAS — Luke Neely\nmight not know where to begin if he\nwere in an opposing coach’s posi-\ntion and had to gameplan against his\nSt. Thomas-St. John Private Schools\nArawaks. The variety of formations\nrunning through his no-huddle\noffense can be a headache for\ndefenses.\n\n“It’s difficult,” Neely said. “We're\na multi-formation, multi-game\n| offense. We run a power game, a gap\nscheme to zone scheme. It’s a lot to\nprepare for. Teams could potentially\nstop us.”\n\nIvanna Eudora Kean High School\n(1-3) hopes to tum that potential into\nreality when the two teams meet at 7\ntonight in an IAA tackle football\n‘game at Lionel Roberts Stadium.\n\nThe Arawaks (2-1) crushed the\nDevil Rays, 44-0, in the season open-\ner, which ended early in the fourth\nquarter because of the league’s mercy\nrule.\n\n“Wehope that the defense, by now,\nhas leamed the schemes,” Kean High\ncoach Elroy Donovan Jr. said. “It was\nthe first game of the season and we\n\nAlexander Lenard, M.D.\n\nZour Certified Orthopasdic Surgeon\n\nPafleyeshipenl cringed\nOrihopaedic Surgecur\nRepartise ir Treen,\n\nSeine ® Spiris Wericsis\n\n£D0G website te Isarri abaut\ntslephane (340) 779-2\n\nhave a lot of young guys.”\n\nDonovan is eager to see if his\ndefense learned from the tough les-\nsons ‘handed out by the Arawaks’\nsenior tailback tandem of Chris\nCilliers and David McDonald.\n\nCilliers pounded his way to two\nrushing touchdowns and a receiving\ntouchdown, and McDonald led the\nteam with 75 rushing yards on seven\ncarries. At 210 pounds, Cilliers can\neasily shed routine tackles.\n\n“He’s a big, strong guy,” Donovan\nsaid. “Our guys have to realize that\nyou have to adjust for that type of\nrunning back. We can’t expect to\nwrap him up high and take him\ndown.”\n\nAt 170 pounds, McDonald offers a\nspeedy change of pace. But he won't\nshy away from contact.\n\n“They're tough guys to bring\ndown,” Neely said. “They’re bruis-\ners and it’s gonna take two or three\nguys to bring them down at any\ntime.”\n\nArawaks dropped a 22-8 game\n\nSee FOOTBALL, page 42\n\ngames as Kean High won the match, 4-1 (14-\n\nture point of the match when three Kean High\n\nKean High’s energy lifts them over Ss.
