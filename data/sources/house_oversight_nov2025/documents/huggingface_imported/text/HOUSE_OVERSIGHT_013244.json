It minimally involves perceiving\ndata from the world, storing data in memory, and deciding what if any new actions need\nto be taken based on the data perceived. It may also involve other processes like deliber-\native thinking or metacognition. Not all OpenCog processing needs to take place within a\ncognitive cycle.\n\ne Cognitive Schematic: An implication of the form \"Context AND Procedure IMPLIES\ngoal”. Learning and utilization of these is key to CogPrime’s cognitive process.\n\ne Cognitive Synergy: The phenomenon by which different cognitive processes, controlling a\nsingle agent, work together in such a way as to help each other be more intelligent. Typically,\nif one has cognitive processes that are individually susceptible to combinatorial explosions,\ncognitive synergy involves coupling them together in such a way that they can help one\nanother overcome each other’s internal combinatorial explosions. The CogPrime design is\nreliant on the hypothesis that its key learning algorithms will display dramatic cognitive\nsynergy when utilized for agent control in appropriate environments.\n\ne CogPrime : The name for the AGI design presented in this book, which is designed specifi-\ncally for implementation within the OpenCog software framework (and this implementation\nis OpenCogPrime).\n\ne CogServer: A piece of software, within OpenCog, that wraps up an Atomspace and a\nnumber of MindAgents, along with other mechanisms like a Scheduler for controlling the\nactivity of the MindAgents, and code for important and exporting data from the Atomspace.\n\ne Cognitive Equation: The principle, identified in Ben Goertzel’s 1994 book \"Chaotic\nLogic\", that minds are collections of pattern-recognition elements, that work by iteratively\nrecognizing patterns in each other and then embodying these patterns as new system ele-\nments. This is seen as distinguishing mind from \"self-organization” in general, as the latter\nis not so focused on continual pattern recognition. Colloquially this means that \"a mind is\na system continually creating itself via recognizing patterns in itself.”\n\ne Combo: The programming language used internally by MOSES to represent the programs\nit evolves. SchemaNodes may refer to Combo programs, whether the latter are learned via\nMOSES or via some other means. The textual realization of Combo resembles LISP with\nless syntactic sugar. Internally a Combo program is represented as a program tree.\n\ne Composer: In the PLN design, a rule is denoted a composer if it needs premises for\ngenerating its consequent. See generator.\n\ne CogBuntu: an Ubuntu Linux remix that contains all required packages and tools to test\nand develop OpenCog.\n\ne Concept Creation: A general term for cognitive processes that create new ConceptNodes,\nPredicateNodes or concept maps representing new concepts.\n\ne Conceptual Blending: A process of creating new concepts via judiciously combining\npieces of old concepts. This may occur in OpenCog in many ways, among them the explicit\nuse of a ConceptBlending MindAgent, that blends two or more ConceptNodes into a new\none.\n\ne Confidence: A component of an OpenCog/PLN TruthValue, which is a scaling into the\ninterval [0,1] of the weight of evidence associated with a truth value. In the simplest case\n(of a probabilistic Simple Truth Value), one uses confidence c = n / (n+k), where n is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013244",
