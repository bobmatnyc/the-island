  "text": "8. INDUSTRY OVERVIEW\n\n8.1. Human Capital\n\nHistorically, the world economy has been viewed as being driven by an asset base of natural resources.\nThis has shifted to an economy driven by industrial and financial resources. This perception is reinforced\nthrough the statistics and measurements used by governments, as seen in the Federal Reserve's\nrepresentation of the U.S. balance sheet. However, it is KUE’s view that the real assets of a city, state,\nregion or country are its people (human capital) and their productive capacity. KUE believes that national\neconomies that fail to embrace this concept will be left behind. Nobel Prize winning economist Gary\nBecker estimates that in today’s service based economy, human capital accounts for 76% of the assets in\nthe U.S.\n\n2005 Human Capital - $238 Trillion Market 2005 U.S. Balance Sheet - $62 Trillion Market\n\nOther Francia ©\n\nOther Tamale gq\nHuman and US Financial\n\nSocial Capital Assets\n74% 26%\n\nSource: Gary Becker\nSource: U.S. Federal Reserve\n\nImportantly in today’s economy, the value of a company is increasingly driven by creativity, innovation\nand education. Companies are recognizing that human capital is their defining asset. With the value of\neducation becoming apparent to government and businesses alike, the Principals believe that a\nsignificant opportunity exists to create an education company that will promote and cultivate human\ncapital. Today, not a single education company ranks in the top 100 worldwide as measured by market\ncapitalization. Within 20 years, KUE believes that the education space will contain some of the largest\ncompanies in the world.\n\n8.1.1. Enhancing Human Capital through Education\nEducation is a primary factor in improving an individual’s life-long productivity. Studies have shown that a\n\nhigher level of education leads to increased lifetime earnings, and that this is increasingly true in the new,\nknowledge economy.\n\n61\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024494",
