For 10 years, he worked as the Photo Editor\nfor the Daily Planet in Telluride, Colorado. His still photography, video, and editing skills are\nentirely self-taught. For years he operated the projector at the Telluride Mountainfilm, soaking\nin the style of the films that showed from around the globe. In 2008 Knight stood upon the stage\nat the Mountainfilm Awards to accept the Director’s Choice Award as well as Audience Choice\nfor Best Film for Red Gold. What a journey.\n\nRed Gold, a feature-length documentary, is set at the headwaters of the Kvichak and the\nNushagak Rivers in Bristol Bay Alaska: the two largest remaining sockeye salmon runs on the\nplanet. Mining companies Northern Dynasty and Anglo American have proposed to extract what\nmay prove to be the richest deposit of gold and copper in the world. Red Gold is a portrait of a\nunique way of life that would not exist if the salmon didn't return with Bristol Bay's tide. This\nfilm won many awards, including Best Film, Ellensburg Film Festival, Award for Cinematic\nVision, Camden International Film Festival, Audience Choice Award for Best Film, Banff\nMountain Film Festival, and Director’s Choice for Best Film, Telluride Mountain Film\n(2007/2008).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025209",
