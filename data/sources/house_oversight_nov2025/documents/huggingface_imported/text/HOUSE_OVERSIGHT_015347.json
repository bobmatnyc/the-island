  "text": "The Taste of Sperm\n\nOnline sexology columnist Sandor Gardos was asked, “How do |\nincrease the amount of my ejaculate? |’ ve noticed porn stars seem to\nejaculate copious amounts of fluid, and |’ d like to be able to wow my\npartner.” Dr. Gardos points out that “the actors in porn films are\nprofessionals. Even they often don’ t ejaculate that much--sometimes\nmovie makers will supplement with synthetic semen shot from a small\ntube.”\n\nWell, I' m just shocked to realize that somewhere in America there\nmust be a group of scientists in a laboratory who earn their salaries by\nmanufacturing fake semen.\n\nMeanwhile, ManNotIncluded.com has become the first cyberspace\nsperm bank for lesbians and single women who want to become pregnant.\nThey are matched with anonymous donors who have the desired race, eye\ncolor, height and weight, then sent instructions on how to inseminate\nthemselves. John Gonzalez, founder of the website, hopes this service will\novercome the hurdles presented by bureaucracies and fertility clinics who\n\nare prejudiced against same-sex couples.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015347",
