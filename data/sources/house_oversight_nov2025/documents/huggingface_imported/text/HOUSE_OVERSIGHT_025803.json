  "text": "Economics needs to be viewed as a dynamic in its own right, not just a function of\npolitical and social issues. Money is not enough. Structural and governance\nreforms are just as critical. Connect structural reforms to communities. Create\ncontext for public investment. Framework s for investing. Jordan is on the edge.\nThey are starting some reforms. Policy counts, not just money. Country and people\nmust own the effort. While we see Egypt and KSA (Saudi) as the big problems, if\nthey aren’t interested in reform, we should spend our energy and resources in\nsmaller countries who are ready and hope they provide role models when dynamics\nof Egypt and KSA are more ripe.\n\nSyria: Should the US intervene?\nTJP summary. There was a remarkable consensus that the US should intervene in\n\nSyria. Many on both sides of the aisle supported the Hadley formulation (see\nbelow). Questions of how to intervene varied somewhat, but few said we should\nnot actively intervene in the Syrian situation. Under discussed were two critical\nissues. First, WMD. Syria has huge stores of chemical and bio weapons and they\nare very widely distributed. Having these fall into hands of terrorists could ruin our\nday. Do we have the knowledge, strategy and will to secure these? Second, post\nAssad Syria is going to be a mess. It will require a serious peace keeping force.\nWho ts going to provide that force? Post script: inspite of the broad consensus that\nthe US must act, the private conversation was that we would not act. It is unclear to\nme why this is the case, but several people (Dems and Repubs who had spoken in\nfavor of action) said they didn’t think it was in the cards.\n\nRichard Falkenrath: The US has the power to depose a very bad guy — Assad.\nShould we do that? Proposition: Don’t do it because:\n. We have a strategy and its working. BS. It is a failed strategy.\n. Is there a reasonable prospect of success if we decide to depose — yes.\n. The costs are acceptable — yes\n. Dono harm. That would be at risk if we decide to depose\n. Legaility. Can be handled\n6. Timing. Election season is problematic.\nRichard’s conclusion 1s we should have a policy to depose Assad.\n\nMm BWN Re\n\nAnn Marie Slaughter (ex Obama) . Depose but with military light. Intel and\ntailored arms to opposition who hold territory in return for pledge of no revenge\nkillings. Multi pronged incrementalism. US 1s still missing one element. We have\nno overt public relations program. Why aren’t we working a full fledged PR\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025803",
