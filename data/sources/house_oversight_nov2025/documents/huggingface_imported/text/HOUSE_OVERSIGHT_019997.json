  "text": "didn’t.\n\nFacing Sessions at the January 10 hearing, Al Franken, the former comedian and\nDemocratic senator from Minnesota, appeared to be casting blindly for an elusive fish in\nhis efforts to find a question. Stopping and starting, slogging through his sentence\nconstruction, Franken, who had been handed a question based on the just-revealed Steele\ndossier, got to this end:\n\nThese documents also allegedly say, quote, “There was a continuing exchange of\ninformation during the campaign between Trump’s surrogates and intermediaries\nfor the Russian government.”\n\nNow, again, I’m telling you this as it’s coming out, so you know. But if it’s true,\nit’s obviously extremely serious and if there is any evidence that anyone affiliated\nwith the Trump campaign communicated with the Russian government in the course\nof this campaign, what will you do?\n\n?\n\nInstead of answering Franken’s circuitous question—“What will you do?”—with an\neasy “We will of course investigate and pursue any and all illegal actions,” a confused\nSessions answered a question he wasn’t asked.\n\nSenator Franken, ’'m not aware of any of those activities. I have been called a\nsurrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I didn’t have—did not have\ncommunications with the Russians, and I’m unable to comment on it.\n\nThe president’s immediate focus was on the question of why anyone believed that\ncommunicating with the Russians was bad. There is nothing wrong with that, Trump\ninsisted. As in the past, it was hard to move him off this point and to the issue at hand: a\npossible lie to Congress. The Post story, to the extent that it registered at all, didn’t worry\nhim. Supported by Hicks, he saw it a way-long-shot effort to pin something on Sessions.\nAnd anyway, Sessions was saying he didn’t meet with the Russians as a campaign\nsurrogate. So? He didn’t. Case closed.\n\n“Fake news,” said the president, using his now all-purpose rejoinder.\n\nAs for the bad 7imes story, as Hicks related it to the president, it appeared to him to be\ngood news. Briefed by anonymous sources in the Obama administration (more anonymous\nObama sources), the story revealed a new dimension to the ever growing suggestion of a\nconnection between the Trump campaign and Russian efforts to influence the U.S.\nelection:\n\nAmerican allies, including the British and the Dutch, had provided information\ndescribing meetings in European cities between Russian officials—and others close\nto Russia’s president, Vladimir V. Putin—and associates of President-elect Trump,\naccording to three former American officials who requested anonymity in\ndiscussing classified intelligence.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019997",
