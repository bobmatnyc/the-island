  "text": "340 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nthe question “Where did the laws of physics come from?” If you don't\nbelieve in a god then pushing a creator figure further and further up the\nchain eventually makes him redundant. If you have faith, you can take\nthe position God is the creator of the fundamental rules.\n\nRegardless of your personal position, I would like to make the\nargument for free will independent of belief. We must resolve the age-\nold paradox: How can God be all-knowing and all-powerful, and still\nhave free will?\n\nThis is a long-standing theological debate dating back to the 15\"\ncentury. It splits theologians into two camps. The first maintains God has\nboth omniscience and omnipotence, and they are not inconsistent. This\nis the compatibilism argument again. Despite the acknowledged paradox,\nthey argue that we should simply accept it and acknowledge that we are\nunable to comprehend such things. I don’t like this argument because\nit essentially denies reason. We are supposed to acknowledge that we\nsimply cannot understand the mind of God. I prefer the more modern\nargument from the second camp that omnipotence trumps omniscience.\nIt preserves the view that man can reason about the Universe - “Man is\nmade in God’s image.”\n\nThis argument follows the logic: God must be able to choose not to\nknow what will happen in the future so that he can have free will.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016030",
