  "text": "Rodriguez, who said in sworn testimony that he was terrified of Miss Maxwell, also said he took the book as an “insurance\npolicy” to prevent Epstein making him “disappear’.\n\nHe was sentenced to 18 months in prison — the same punishment Epstein received for his sex offences — in June last year.\nHis wife, Patricia Dunn, told The Daily Telegraph that he was “sorry” for his error.\n\nDave Lee Brannon, an Assistant Public Defender who represented Rodriguez, said: “If this book had been produced when\nrequested, Mr Epstein’s sentence may have been significantly different.”\n\nDetails of the journal emerged in a lawsuit brought in Florida by Epstein against Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing\nseveral alleged victims.\n\nEpstein alleges Edwards was linked to a \"Ponzi scheme\" run by a colleague, which lured investors by falsely claiming\nEpstein had agreed to settle sex-offence lawsuits for hundreds of millions of dollars.\n\nEdwards rejects the allegation, which has already been dismissed by the Florida Bar.\n\n© Copyright of Telegraph Media Group Limited 2011\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013439",
