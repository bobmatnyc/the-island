  "text": "Similarly, although Mr. Horowitz found no evidence that then-FBI Director James Comey was trying\nto influence the election, Mr. Comey did make decisions based on political considerations. He told the\ninspector general that his election-eve decision to reopen the Clinton email investigation was\n\nmotivated by a desire to protect her assumed presidency’s legitimacy.\n\nThe inspector general wrote that Mr. Strzok’s text messages “created the appearance that investigative\ndecisions were impacted by bias or improper considerations.” The report adds, importantly, that “most\nof the text messages raising such questions pertained to the Russia investigation.” Given how biases\nineluctably shape behavior, these facts create a strong inference that by squelching the Clinton\ninvestigation and building a narrative of Trump-Russia collusion, a group of government officials\nsought to bolster Mrs. Clinton’s electoral chances and, if the unthinkable happened, obtain an\n\ninsurance policy to cripple the Trump administration with accusations of illegitimacy.\n\nWhat does this have to do with Mr. Mueller, who was appointed in May 2017 after President Trump\nfired Mr. Comey? The inspector general concludes that the pervasive bias “cast a cloud over the FBI\ninvestigations to which these employees were assigned,” including Crossfire. And if Crossfire was\npolitically motivated, then its culmination, the appointment of a special counsel, inherited the taint. All\nspecial-counsel activities—investigations, plea deals, subpoenas, reports, indictments and\nconvictions—are fruit of a poisonous tree, byproducts of a violation of due process. That Mr. Mueller\n\nand his staff had nothing to do with Crossfire’s origin offers no cure.\n\nWhen the government deprives a person of life, liberty or property, it is required to use fundamentally\nfair processes. The Supreme Court has made clear that when governmental action “shocks the\nconscience,” it violates due process. Such conduct includes investigative or prosecutorial efforts that\n\nappear, under the totality of the circumstances, to be motivated by corruption, bias or entrapment.\n\nIn U.S. v. Russell (1973), the justices observed: “We may someday be presented with a situation in\nwhich the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would\nabsolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction.” It didn’t take\nlong. In Blackledge v. Perry (1974), the court concluded that due process was offended by a\nprosecutor’s “realistic likelihood of ‘vindictiveness’ ” that tainted the “very initiation of proceedings.”\nIn Young v. U.S. ex rel. Vuitton (1987), the justices held that because prosecutors have “power to\nemploy the full machinery of the state in scrutinizing any given individual . .. we must have assurance\nthat those who would wield this power will be guided solely by their sense of public responsibility for\nthe attainment of justice.” Prosecutors must be “disinterested” and make “dispassionate assessments,”\n\nfree from any personal bias.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026493",
