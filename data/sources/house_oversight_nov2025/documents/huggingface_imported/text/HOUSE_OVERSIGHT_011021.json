  "text": "out the human capital of children. But Farr deserves credit for pointing out that\n\nhuman capital in general capitalizes pay less invested consumption.\n\nKeynes’ teacher Alfred Marshall agreed with Farr in 1990’. As I read this passage,\nMarshall interpreted maintenance consumption as investment. So did B. F. Kiker? in\n1968. | interpret it as exhaust in taste satisfaction enabling energy to earn pay\nconcurrently, while preserving but not increasing pay expectations in future.\nInvested consumption would mean addition to human capital concurrently for\n\nexpected realization with interest in higher pay later.\n\nMeanwhile economists had developed the complementary idea of human capital as\n\npresent cost of investment accumulated before. Adam Smith? in 1776 wrote\n\n.. The acquisition of such talents, by the maintenance of the acquirer during\nhis education, study, or apprenticeship, always costs a real expense, which is\n\na capital fixed and realized, as it were, in his person.\n\nThe conversion of some consumption into human capital was a favorite theme of\nFrank Knight a generation before Schultz. Only the rest is what Schultz called pure\nconsumption eliminated from the economy in satisfying tastes. Becker added in\n1964 that this investment must be expected to be recovered with interest, at least\nwhen paid by employers in job training. Schultz had also pointed out that human\ncapital depreciates, and invests some work in itself in the effort of learning to\ncomplement the exterior investment of nurture and schooling. Ben-Porath,\nexpressing a Schultz-led consensus, added in 1967 that human capital growth is\ninvested consumption (the nurture and schooling) plus self-invested work less\nhuman depreciation. All these ideas are now accepted everywhere in human capital\n\nstudies.\n\n7 Principles of Economics.\n8 A History of Human Capital. | learned of Farr from Kiker.\n° The Wealth of Nations.\n\nChapter 5 Bringing Human Capital In 1/13/16 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011021",
