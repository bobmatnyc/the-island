China's claim of\nownership of the South China Sea, along with its\ncreeping militarization of previously uninhabited\nislets, is at least as ambitious as Russia's move,\nthough the impact is perhaps less jolting given\nthe dearth of occupied populations.\n\nThere have been other reversions to 20th-centu-\nry methods of repression. For example:\n\nPolitical prisoners: During the 20th century,\nopposition figures, political dissidents, advocates\nfor minority groups, and people who wrote critical\ncommentaries were regularly sentenced to prison\nterms, often under grim conditions, by dicta-\ntorships of all stripes. Amnesty International's\nfounding mission was the defense of what were\ncalled “prisoners of conscience,” and they ranged\nfrom dissidents and Jewish refuseniks in the So-\nviet Union to those who resisted right-wing juntas\nin Latin America. Soviet dissidents like Natan\nSharansky and Vladimir Bukovsky were the focus\nof international campaigns organized by human\nrights organizations and cautiously embraced by\nthe United States and other governments.\n\nThe ranks of political prisoners declined sub-\nstantially after the end of the Cold War and the\ncollapse of dictatorships in Latin America, Asia,\nand to acertain extent Africa. Indeed, it was a\nmajor objective of the new authoritarianism to\nmaintain political control without shedding blood\nor putting people behind bars, actions that pro-\nvoked condemnation by human rights advocates,\ndemocratic governments, and UN entities.\n\nRecently, however, the political prisoner has\nmade a comeback. One notably egregious\noffender is Azerbaijan. Under President Ilham\nAliyev, this country of just 9.4 million people has\namassed one of the world's largest numbers of\npolitical prisoners per capita, with approximately\n80 prisoners of conscience during 2015, accord-\ning to verified figures. Azerbaijan's repression\nhas grown despite the fact that Aliyev already\nenjoyed near-total control of key institutions and\ndistinctly gentle treatment from U.S. and Euro-\npean political leaders due to Azerbaijan's role as\nan alternative to Russian energy exports.\n\nVenezuela also has a substantial number of\npolitical prisoners—around 100 as of June 2016,\naccording to credible sources, including promi-\n\nnent members of the political opposition.? Under\nPresident Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, some estimates\nsuggest that Egypt holds as many as 60,000 polit-\nical prisoners.’ Turkish authorities have similarly\nrounded up tens of thousands of people in the\nwake of the July 2016 coup attempt. A much\nsmaller country, Bahrain, has convicted hundreds\nof people of political crimes since 2011, when the\nmonarchy began arresting members of the polit-\nical opposition who were demanding democratic\nelections and other freedoms.’\n\nChina is in a class by itself. Since the 1989\ncrackdown on prodemocracy protests in Tian-\nanmen Square, the Communist Party leadership\nhas regularly jailed political dissidents, espe-\ncially those who argued publicly for democratic\npolitical changes or made gestures toward the\nformation of opposition political parties. The\nmost notable political prisoner is Liu Xiaobo, the\nNobel Peace Prize winner who was sentenced to\n11 years in prison in 2009. However, conditions\nhave grown far worse under President Xi Jinping,\nas a numbing procession of lawyers, journalists,\nbloggers, women's advocates, minority rights\ncampaigners, and religious believers have been\ndetained, placed under house arrest, disap-\npeared, or sentenced to prison.>\n\nPublic confessions: Humiliating public con-\nfessions of ideological crimes were a staple of\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin's purges and Mao\nZedong’s Cultural Revolution in China. They\nwere also employed by Eastern European sat-\nellite regimes during the show trials of the late\n1940s. A peculiarly communist technique, the\npublic confession was largely abandoned after\nthe deaths of Stalin and Mao.\n\nUnder Xi, China has revived the practice. A grow-\ning list of editors, human rights lawyers, and advo-\ncates of political reform have been coerced into\nmaking televised confessions of their “crimes.”\nThe Chinese authorities even intimidated a Swed-\nish citizen, legal reform activist Peter Dahlin, into\nconfessing that he broke Chinese law and “hurt\nthe feelings of the Chinese people.” Dahlin was\naccused of endangering state security by funding\nhuman rights lawyers and compiling reports on\nthe state of human rights in China.®\n\nntensified media domination: Most modern au-\nthoritarian countries allowed a sufficient degree\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\n53\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019287",
