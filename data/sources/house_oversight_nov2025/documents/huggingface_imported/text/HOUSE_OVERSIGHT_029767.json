  "text": "he is required to provide only his permanent address to the database.\n\nEpstein is currently listed under his Florida home even though he is no longer a Florida resident either (after his\narrest he immediately became a US VI resident), but then again who's keeping count?\n\nOnce again these are mere technicalities when it comes to Epstein's sexual predator case. The two most\ndisturbing parts of this story are that this could easily happen again and that once again there will be no justice.\nHad Epstein been a caring benefactor contributing to society and these young girl's education and well being\nthen the world would have judged him differently.\n\nWhat he has done instead is the exact opposite -- causing enormous damage to hundreds of underage girls who\ncould have been sponsored towards a better education.\n\nWith respect to Manhattan DA Cyrus Vance, I'm confused by his decision to allow this sexual predator to live\nat his Fifth Avenue house all this time (since August 2010), given his rather tough stance on gun control as\nwitnessed by his testimony in Friday's NYPost when asked about a Florida driver cleared in a Manhattan\nweapon's charge, \"guns brought illegally into New York City\" he said, \" for any reason violate well established\nstate laws and are a threat to our public safety\".\n\nThen wouldn't a registered sex offender living 500 feet from a park (Central Park where young girls\ncongregate), and with resources to spare be an even more dangerous threat to society?\n\nThe Billionaire Pedophile's Sex Den\nby Conchita Sarnoff javascript:void(0)\n\n© javascript:;javascript:;\ne http:/(www.thedailybeast.com/blogs- and-stories/2010-07-22/jeftrey-epstein-pedophile-billionaire-and-his-sex-den/full/\ne javascript:void(0)\n\ne javascript:void(0)\ne javascript:void(0)\n\nNewscom Hedge fund mogul and sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who went free this week, lived in a\ndepraved world of thrice-daily massages, pornographic artwork, and hush money—that’s only now\nbeing revealed. Conchita Sarnoff reports on the sordid details in part two of her exclusive exposé. Also:\n¢ Nude images of young girls were scattered around the house and the bathroom soap was shaped like sex\norgans\n¢ Staff trolled for fresh recruits to make sure Epstein had two or three massage appointments each day\n¢ The house manager has been sentenced to a longer prison term than Epstein—for trying to sell notes\nregarding massage appointments\n¢ Epstein gave $1 million to his friend Jean Luc Brunel when he was starting the modeling agency MC2\n¢ According to a former bookkeeper, young girls were brought to the U.S. by MC2—often from Eastern\nEurope—then traveled on Epstein’s private jets\nJeffrey Epstein’s loyal friends say that his prosecution was unduly harsh, rather than outrageously lenient.\nThey insist that his sexual habits, although obsessive and unusual, were mostly legal and essentially harmless.\nAs the police records attest, the girls brought to El Brillo Way were routinely told they could “say no” at any\ntime during a massage as Epstein escalated contact in a step-by-step assault that was remarkably similar in\nevery victim’s statement: First she would be asked to remove her shirt, then her pants. He would attempt to\nfondle her buttocks and breasts as he masturbated, then bring out a large vibrator. There was sometimes digital\npenetration, and the more willing girls were lured into full-blown sexual relations with both Epstein and Nadia\nMarcinkova, who was referred to in press accounts and police reports as Epstein’s live-in “sex slave.”\n\nA former bookkeeper in the Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed\n\nthat MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nIt’s true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house voluntarily several\ntimes—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing on the criminality of the contact,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029767",
