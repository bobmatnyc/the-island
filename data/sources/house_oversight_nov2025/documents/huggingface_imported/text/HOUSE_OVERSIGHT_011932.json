  "text": "Epstein said “I’m 100 percent convinced that he doesn’t traffic children.” (Brunel has never been\ncharged.)\n\nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young\nand very beautiful; many were from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former\nbookkeeper in the agency's Miami office, who also arranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S.,\nconfirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nPilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight\nmanifests. Other times, the pilot would just list the other passengers plus \"femmale.”\n\nEditor’s Note: An earlier version of this article misidentified the subject of Craig Pyes’\n\ninvestigation and the title of Michael Gross’ book. The Daily Beast has corrected the subject and\ntitle and regrets the error.\n\nRead Conchita Sarnoff's original report on Epstein.\nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500\ncompanies and has produced three current events debate television programs, The Americas\n\nForum, from Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report. She is a contributor\nto The Huffington Post. She is writing a book about child trafficking in America.\n\n2]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011932",
