  "text": "Half Full\n\nSince the trough of the global financial crisis in\nMarch 2009, US equities have returned nearly\n300%, producing one of the longest bull markets\nin the post-WWII period and outperforming all\nother major developed and emerging market\ncountry equities. US equities have also exceeded\ntheir pre-crisis peaks of October 2007 and March\n2000 by 75% and 103%, respectively, on a total\nreturn basis. This bull market has exceeded all\nother bull markets but one in length and exceeded\nall but three in magnitude.\n\nUS economic growth has also exceeded that of\nmost other recoveries in length. This recovery is the\nfourth-longest recovery in the post-WWII period?\nand if, as we expect, the US economy avoids a\nrecession in the first half of 2017, this recovery\nwill become the third-longest. While many critics\ncorrectly point out that it is the slowest recovery\nsince WWII, it has actually created more economic\ngrowth than some of the stronger recoveries\nthat lasted for shorter periods. On a cumulative\nbasis, this recovery ranks sixth out of the last 10\nrecoveries with respect to GDP growth. What this\nrecovery has lacked in strength, it has partially\nmade up for in length.\n\nThe slow but steady growth has also exceeded\nthat of all other major developed economies,\nand US GDP per capita has increased more than\nthe GDP per capita of any major developed or\nemerging market country.\n\nThis recovery has created over 15 million\njobs. The unemployment rate decreased from\na peak of 10.0% in October 2009 to 4.6% in\nNovember 2016 and is now below its long-term\naverage of 5.8%. Even the broader U6 measure,\nwhich adds the underemployed (such as part-\ntime and discouraged workers) to the number of\nunemployed, has fallen from a peak of 17.1% to\n9.3%, and stands below its long-term average of\n10.6%. Unemployment claims are not only lower\nthan they were during pre-crisis troughs but also\nat their lowest since 1973; they are also the lowest\non record as a percentage of the labor force (see\nExhibit 1).\n\nAs a result of more robust employment, wages\nhave increased as well.
