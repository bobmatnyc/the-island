Just got off the phone with Vinit.
DB stopped marketmaking OTC oil options - for short dated I'd go for exch traded - better liquidity and lower transaction costs in and
out.

My central scenario - Kerry Lavrov meeting Friday will be a bust and the Crimea referendum this weekend will result in "yes" given
the 59pct ethic Russian makeup. Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging from g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is
raised a notch. Russia follows with more threats of counter-sanctions. My sense is the Obama 5m of 696m SPR release is to show
Merkel and co he will step in. He needs to because there are 8 small European and Baltic countries that rec 70%+ of their gas from
Russia. Germany gets 30%.

Cross asset correlations outside of the US are increasing past few days - eg copper and the Turkish lira hourly charts are on top of each
other past 4 days. I'm worried there is a 30-40pct(?) chance of a hard risk off move in markets in first half of next week - more focused
on European equities, copper, EM FX (Turkey, ZAR, Ruble etc) than SPX. In that scenario oil is way up.

Exchange WTI calls - there are 2 options (as of 3pm est):

5day expiry 17march 2014 underlying clj4 97.92

and

35d expiry 16april2014 underlying clk4 97.59

** The 5 day options are a bit short - one possibility is sell a 3usd out of the money put (95.5 strike) for 20cents and buy a 2usd OTM
100 call for 25. Net pay 5cents. But 5d is a bit short for me.

**For 35d expiry You could look at selling 91.50 (6usd OTM put) for 56cents and buying 103c (5.5usd OTM) for 58cents or the 102c
(4.5usd OTM) for 76cents.
