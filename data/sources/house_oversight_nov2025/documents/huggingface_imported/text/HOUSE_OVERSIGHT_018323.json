  "text": "merciless clawing action we saw at the start of this chapter, which explains the\nunique power (and value) of the essential firms of our age. Once that’s done,\nhowever, once the mesh of distribution and connection is in place and growing, then\nemergence begins. The completely new appears. This is why the most successful\ninvestors or leaders of our era have a near pathological desire to push and break old\nsystems. They do this because they have a faith, an instinct, that if they shove hard\nenough to snap an equilibrium, then something else will emerge. They are right.\nThey have all the laws of physics and history behind them. In commerce, the\ndestruction of old business models breeds new ones. In terrorism, brutal violence is\nmore useful than bottled anger; it’s a tool to speed the viral emergence of chaos\n(and, some hope, a new politics). What emerges from change? Fresh structures,\ngates that connect us and bind us .If the Seventh Sense features a nearly wild desire\nto smash old equilibriums it is because of the total confidence that something else\nwill emerge.\n\nLater in life, turning to a philosophical view, Paul Baran said that his webs,\ndistributing themselves around the world with such smooth and relentless energy,\nwere reflecting a kind of inevitable progress, a propensity of linked things to keep\nlinking. Even if he did not see and name our world exactly, he likely could have\npredicted it. “Every object in the universe,” he once wrote, “is connected (by\ngravity/radiation vectors) to every other object.” We know now just how much\ntruth is buried in Baran’s almost philosophical words. Objects and people and places\nnow feed data constantly into the network and to each other. This presses them to\nevolve, to change, to connect again. It is simply a matter of time before those\nconnections bubble up into our real lives to change our economy, our security and\nour leaders. That kludgey, parenthetically weird phrase of Baran’s - wired together\n“(by gravity/radiation vectors)” - tells us a lot. The spread of links is like gravity\nnow. It is like radiation. Irresistible. All-penetrating and revealing the deep human\ntruth in Baran’s Holocaust-bred instincts: To survive and to connect are really the\nsame thing.\n\n91\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018323",
