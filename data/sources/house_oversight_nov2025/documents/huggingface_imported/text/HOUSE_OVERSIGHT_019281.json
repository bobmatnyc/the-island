Nor does sovereign democracy represent\na genuine commitment to the notion of national\nsovereignty, as countries on the Russian periphery\n\nwill attest. On repeated occasions, Putin has demon-\nstrated a readiness to intervene in the affairs of nearby\ncountries by fomenting ethnic discontent, undermin-\ning the economy, or grabbing territory.\n\nPutin has in effect set down a doctrine of limited\nsovereignty for Russia's neighbors, especially those\nthat were part of the Soviet Union. The Kremlin's\ntactics are meant to keep these countries fearful and\noff balance. The instruments of choice range from\n\nthe nonviolent, such as destabilizing propaganda and\neconomic pressure, to the lethally aggressive, such as\nproxy insurgencies and outright invasion.\n\nThe following are the main techniques employed by\nthe Kremlin to influence the actions of its neighbors:\n\n1. Civil society and ‘traditional values’: The Krem-\nlin has funded and encouraged pro-Russian civil\nsociety organizations in neighboring states to\n\n“Certainly within the next four to five\nyears [Russia] will have the ability\nto conduct operations in eastern\nUkraine and pressure the Baltics\n\nand pressure Georgia and do other\nthings, without having to do a full\nmobilization.”\n\n—U.S. Lieutenant General Ben Hodges\n\n3. The energy weapon: At various times during Pu-\ntin’s tenure, Russia has sought to use its oil and\nnatural gas exports as a means of disciplining\nUkraine and other neighbors. It has raised and\nlowered prices for political reasons, abruptly\nhalted deliveries in the dead of winter, and ma-\nnipulated pipeline routes and investments to\ndrive a wedge between Germany and other Eu-\nropean powers on one side and the Baltic states\nand Ukraine on the other.\n\n. The trade weapon: Russia has invoked dubious\nhealth concerns and other pretexts to block\nthe import of products from countries whose\ngovernments displease Putin, including Georgia,\nMoldova, and Poland, as well as the European\nUnion (EU) as a bloc.®\n\n5. Cyberwarfare: Russian-backed hackers are\n\nbuild influence among local populations and\npromote its policies and interests. The Russian\ngovernment has also exploited its partnership\nwith the Orthodox Church to present itself as a\nchampion of “traditional values,” and to portray\nopponents—including human rights activists\nand European democracies—as purveyors of\nhedonism and immorality.’\n\n. Propaganda offensives: The Kremlin has made\npowerful use of Russian-language media, es-\npecially state-controlled television stations, to\nspread disinformation and foment discontent\namong ethnic Russians in the Baltics, Ukraine,\nMoldova, and elsewhere.\n\nwidely believed responsible for a powerful 2007\ncyberattack on government websites in Estonia\nin the wake of a controversy over the removal of\na war memorial. Other countries in the region\nhave since suffered similar attacks, particularly\nUkraine following the 2014 ouster of President\nViktor Yanukovych and Russia’s invasion of\nCrimea and the Donbas.\n\n. Military threats: In the wake of the Ukraine inva-\n\nsion and subsequent sanctions, the Russian mil-\nitary launched a series of military exercises on\nits borders with the Baltic states and intensified\nmore distant patrols that tested the readiness of\na number of European navies and air forces.\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\n47\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019281",
