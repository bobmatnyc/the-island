The leasing office will open the first week of\nOctober offering “competitive” rents for a luxury building, according to Bond New\nYork’s Douglas Wagner, with move-ins slated for November and December.\n\nFf\n\nAnart-infused kitchen inside a condo at The Charles.\n\nPhoto: Evan Joseph Images\n\nWant to buy now, and move in immediately? The building most ahead of the curve is\nThe Charles. Previously stalled after 2008’s downturn, the 32-story condo at 1355 First\nAve. got redesigned to emphasize large full-floor apartments before breaking ground\nin 2012. And it’s paid off. There are four units left out of 27 total, which started at\n$5.97 million. A recent sale of the top six floors to two unidentified relatives for a total\nof $59 million made headlines. That price? On First Avenue?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022439",
