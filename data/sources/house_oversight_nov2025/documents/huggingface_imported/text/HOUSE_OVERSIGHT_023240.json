  "text": ". Asking me who to hire , estate attny tax people etc. :\n\nI have taken heat for years over the fact that i gave you no more than carlyns name, . no follow up\nquestions no interactions , not even one single question asked of me re her work. (that was Eileen _)\nbut somehow carlyns fuck up was my doing. . _ when i told you that i thought Eileen wasn't up to the\ntask, you bellowed that i was talking out of both sides of my mouth. . You told me this year , that by\ntrying to protect you from crazy joslin, I had in essence fired him and it was my responsibility to do his\nwork. it then turns out that he didn't consider himself fired at all he just received less money. and\ncontinued to make a really dangerous mess.. Joshn castrucci, in your eyes , was also my doing , though\nemail after email said , I take no responsibility for him,and 1YOU SHOULD NOT HIRE HIM |!!! , your\nresponse was that was my opinion was only because i didn't trust him. then to add insult to injury last jan\nyou told me he was gone. however he too is still there, and a waste of money and space.\n\nMy time is complicated by Donald's potentially eviscerating any reason for anyone to use the\nforeign funds repatriation plan that i had put together. . however as you are aware I have some decisions\nto make re my time allocation in the next year or two. so at least for a few weeks I am unable to commit\nmuch time and make any future plans to guide you in the redoing of your procrastination produced\nmess.\n\nThat being said, the tasks at hand are the following.\nYou have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully\nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It\nwould be much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??! . I\nam concerned re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn\nACCURATE . org charts. books , balance sheets . trust valuations. are all a part. Barry will need 2\nmonths to just get his arm around what is there , this is before any needed modifications.,\n\na way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts ,\nfiling requirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how\nthey fit into new plan. . \"XXXXX\" planning. art partnership engagement .. , airplane re-do. , buying\n\nanother. .? boat sale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years overdue. . an\naccounting system. fire john... joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and . except for heather\neveryone should be replaced withnew. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize. cash\nflow reporting. cash mgmt. stock sales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take\nmonths to review now. . you CANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. .CANNOT!!! _ this will\nbe very detailed work. . a self inflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit .\nor contain it. . . you will need 3 new hires .as there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I\nhave great hope in Barry as you know. He will need to be trained. note\n\n; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin, : im\nglad that you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense , in fact I take comfort in the\nfact that after only one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a\nyear or more.\n\nI expect as a friend you will understand that\n\nI will no longer , not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long\noverdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul\nweiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin, ,no one. needs toend.. you and I\nhad previously agreed no more of that , and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be\nfair I can not say im surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of\nmoney, you wont want to pay , so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge\n\nIf I can find the time to work , on your project , which is not by any means certain as I have said, I\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023240",
