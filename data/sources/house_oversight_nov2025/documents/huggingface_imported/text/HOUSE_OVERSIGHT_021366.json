Her\nresearch relates the history of Christian thought\nto areas of contemporary theological concern\nusing critical, social, and feminist theory, with a\nspecial focus on the possible practical\nimplications of Christian beliefs and symbols.\nShe has lectured widely throughout the United\nStates and Europe, and is the author of six books:\nGod and Creation in Christian Theology:\nTyranny or Empowerment? (1988, Blackwell);\nThe Politics of God (1992, Fortress); Theories of\nCulture: A New Agenda for Theology (1997,\nFortress); Jesus, Humanity and the Trinity (2001,\nContinuum and Fortress Press); Economy of\nGrace (2005, Fortress); and Christ the Key\n(2010, Cambridge).\n\nChristian beliefs are not just theoretical\nmatters, involving putative truth claims about the\nnature of ultimate reality, but practical ones:\nChristian beliefs are often promulgated with the\nhope of impacting the way human beings live, by\nestablishing, for example, the meaningfulness of\nand motivations for certain forms of social\nbehavior. Prior research has concerned the\npossible economic, social and political\nconsequences of Christian beliefs about God's\nrelation to the world. This essay extends such\nquestioning to the topic of perceived social\nisolation. How might belief in God as an\ninvisible force in everyday life affect an\nindividual's sense of social connection?\n\nPage |120\n\nto scientific hypothesis generation.”\nScientists can better test for the social\nand health consequences of religious\ncommitment when they know more\nabout the character and range of beliefs\nabout God that such commitment brings.\nThis chapter hopes to show, in\nparticular, that exactly what Christians\nbelieve about the nature of God’s\ninfluence on their lives is likely to have\nan important bearing on one of the\nquestions of this volume: How can\nreligion encourage a sense of connection\nto others, especially in situations of\nperceived social isolation, and thereby\nassuage the adverse health consequences\nof loneliness?\n\nDepending on what they think\nGod is like, Christians vary in the way\nthey expect God to be a present\ninfluence on their daily lives. God’s\nnature is supernatural or transcendent,\nwhich means God is not very much like\nany of the ordinary persons or things\nwith which they come into regular\ncontact. Christians use the same terms\nfor God that they use for talking about\nordinary persons and things but they\ntherefore know that neither set of terms\nis really adequate to capture who or what\nGod is. On the one hand, God is\nsomething like a human being in that\nGod loves them and wants to do them\ngood, and in that God is unhappy with\ntheir failings and trying, through the use\nof carrots and sticks, to get them to\nchange. But, on the other hand, God is\nreally not very much like an ordinary\nhuman being in that God is present at all\ntimes and everywhere, working\ninexorably to bring about what God\nintends throughout the entirety of\npeoples’ lives by way of influences of\nboth personal and impersonal sorts--for\nexample, through personal words of\nadvice and warning found in the Bible as\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021366",
