  "text": "media president, had one of the most dysfunctional communication operations in modern\nWhite House history. Mike Dubke, a Republican PR operative who was hired as White\nHouse communications director, was, by all estimations, from the first day on his way out\nthe door. In the end he lasted only three months.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nThe White House Correspondents’ Dinner rose, as much as any other challenge for the\nnew president and his team, as a test of his abilities. He wanted to do it. He was certain\nthat the power of his charm was greater than the rancor that he bore this audience—or that\nthey bore him.\n\nHe recalled his 2015 Saturday Night Live appearance—which, in his view, was entirely\nsuccessful. In fact, he had refused to prepare, had kept saying he would “improvise,” no\nproblem. Comedians don’t actually improvise, he was told; it’s all scripted and rehearsed.\nBut this counsel had only marginal effect.\n\nAlmost nobody except the president himself thought he could pull off the\nCorrespondents’ Dinner. His staff was terrified that he would die up there in front of a\nseething and contemptuous audience. Though he could dish it out, often very harshly, no\none thought he could take it. Still, the president seemed eager to appear at the event, if\ncasual about it, too—with Hicks, ordinarily encouraging his every impulse, trying not to.\n\nBannon pressed the symbolic point: the president should not be seen currying the favor\nof his enemies, or trying to entertain them. The media was a much better whipping boy\nthan it was a partner in crime. The Bannon principle, the steel stake in the ground,\nremained: don’t bend, don’t accommodate, don’t meet halfway. And in the end, rather than\nimplying that Trump did not have the talent and wit to move this crowd, that was a much\nbetter way to persuade the president that he should not appear at the dinner.\n\nWhen Trump finally agreed to forgo the event, Conway, Hicks, and virtually\neverybody else in the West Wing breathed a lot easier.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nShortly after five o’clock on the one hundredth day of his presidency—a particularly\nmuggy one—while twenty-five hundred or so members of news organizations and their\nfriends gathered at the Washington Hilton for the White House Correspondents’ Dinner,\nthe president left the West Wing for Marine One, which was soon en route to Andrews Air\nForce Base. Accompanying him were Steve Bannon, Stephen Miller, Reince Priebus,\nHope Hicks, and Kellyanne Conway. Vice President Pence and his wife joined the group\nat Andrews for the brief flight on Air Force One to Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, where the\npresident would give a speech. During the flight, crab cakes were served, and Face the\nNation’s John Dickerson was granted a special hundredth-day interview.\n\nThe first Harrisburg event was held at a factory that manufactured landscaping and\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020040",
