  "text": "Image source: TIME\n\nLIFE photographer Robert Capa captured this dramatic image on 6 June, 1944 — during the D-Day invasion. The man in\nthe photo is Private First Class Huston Riley, a 22-year-old soldier who was shot multiple times. The photographer and a\nfellow sergeant helped the wounded soldier who later recalled thinking “What the hell is this guy doing here? I can’t\nbelieve it. Here’s a cameraman on the shore.” Robert spent over an hour taking photographs as men around him died.\nSadly, only one roll of the film survived but the grainy photos were enough to portray the gut-wrenching atmosphere of\nthat day.\n\n#27 An Injured Young Mill Worker\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020693",
