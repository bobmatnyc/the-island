  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nGoldberg seat on the Supreme Court. He has proved to be an extraordinary judge and is one of\nthe fairest people I know.”\n\nSome lawyers describe their clerkships as interesting or career-enhancing “jobs.” My clerkships\nwere life-changing experiences, which continue to influence me to this day. There could be no\nbetter preparation for my life as a professor at Harvard Law School.\n\n'? When he was finally appointed to the Supreme Court, he invited me to come to his swearing in\nat the White House, after which there was a little party, where wonderful White House cookies\nwere being served. My daughter was then in elementary school and I thought it would be nice to\nbring to her class a bunch of White House cookies for their next snack period. I took a paper\nnapkin with White House markings and I started to put as many cookies as I could in it and then\ninto my pocket. Suddenly there was a tap on my shoulder, “Stealing cookies from the White\nHouse, huh?” It was Hillary. She told me I didn’t have to do that. She would be happy to give\nme a large box to take home. The kids in my daughter’s class loved the cookies and the story.\nBut the truth is they weren’t quite as good as my mother’s.\n\n70\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017157",
