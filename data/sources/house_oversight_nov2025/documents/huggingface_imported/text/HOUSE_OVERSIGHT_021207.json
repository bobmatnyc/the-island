  "text": "continued to surprise me with his efforts to make me believe we were\nmore than just friends with a summer crush. “ You see... your problem is\nthat you don’t see what I am looking at right here in front of me, a\nbeautiful girl who is completely lost in a game that she has no control\nover. Get out of it now, take my hand and follow me back to my home in\nAustralia.” I heard what he had said but I found it hard to comprehend\nwhat he was actually talking about. “What?” I asked him with a look of\nconfusion on my face. “Your nobody’s property, you can do this. Marry\nme.” His statements got more and more profound as he went on.\nRepeating the question he got on one knee and proposed again “ Jenna, I\nam in love with you and want to spend the rest of my life making you\nhappy. Please don’t go back to him. I know that | am the only one for you\nand I will always treat you right. He paused for another second and\nrepeated his question “Jenna, will you please marry me?” My hands fell\ninto my face after that and without even letting myself think through the\nanswer, ! let my heart do all of the talking. Looking back up at him I said\n“Yes!” | almost shouted the answer at him, as if saying it louder would\ngive the word more meaning. Wanting to believe him and everything that\nhe was saying felt like a vacation from all of the suffering and loneliness\nthat I had endured over a lifetime of abuse and degradation but knowing\nwhat you want and getting it are two different things that rarely went\nhand in hand...or so I thought. All 1 knew from the brief period I had\nknown this stranger was that he was offering me a life and love down an\nunfamiliar path and it was a gamble to believe a complete stranger but\nsomehow I knew he was right. My heart was beating so loud I thought it\nwas going to jump right out of my chest. With the earnestly in my reply\nhe picked me up in his strong arms and took me back to the bed and\nreiterated his words in a more physical sense this time. Never had I felt\nloved like this before, so swept off my feet and unable to even think, eat,\nor do anything for that matter which would involve leaving the hotel\nroom without him.\n\nEveryday after school would be my Robbie waiting to take me back to\nthe hotel room for another night’s passionate rendezvous, but a few\nnights after his proposal, he had another surprise in store. He didn’t just\nwant to get married someday. He wanted to get married now, this week\neven. I walked into the fabric store and was attended too by several\nseamstresses who were already be expecting my arrival. I was there to\ndesign and have fun designing my own dream wedding dress. While I\nwas busy picking out fabrics and having measurements taken I would\nlook away for a moment only to catch his tender eyes staring in my\ndirection. Such adoration behind his looks...could it be real? I would\noften ponder it to myself just hoping for the gamble I was taking to work\n\n1 Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFRE004258\n\nout. I still had to believe in something better than what I was accustomed\ntoo and here he was right smack dab in front of me.\n\nGiggling at all of the lace and frills they were trying to dress me up in,\nlooking more like an antique porcelain doll than anything else T closed\nmy eyes and pictured the day that I thought would never come, starting to\nimagine the kind of dress I would like to wear I envisioned a simple\nsleekness, a complimentary figure hugging gown with a small train but\nlong enough to distinct it as an actual wedding dress. After we settled on\nwhat we were going to wear for the big day, we would next have to\ndecide where we would hold the ceremony. Not before celebrating the\nentire week beforehand though. We started our honeymoon early\ncelebrating every night spending our time between my hotel room and\nsending our heads spinning on the dance floor at many different clubs.\nOnly with each other in sight, the dance floor was ours, we were out to\ngive each other something to remember each night by. | whispered all of\nthe things [ couldn’t wait to do him once we got back to the hotel room\nand watching him heat up on the dance floor I was never able to get\nenough of him driving me crazy. Like a thirst | was unable to quench, his\nlips were like a fountain of deep springs that | could never reach the\nbottom of.\n\nSeven days, exactly a week after his proposal I sat on my bed in distress,\ncontemplating what | would say to the man who | was about to call.\nThere was no nice way to go about it. | couldn’t last forever with him and\nthis was my one chance to get out of it for good. | was leaving him, never\nto return to him ever again. I just had to go ahead and do it. Part of me\nwas hoping he’d be at least a little happy for me and the sudden change in\nmy life’s direction but the other part of me knew I was already asking too\nmuch of him.\n\nCalling his office in New York I was transferred to Jeffrey’s personal\noffice. He picked up the phone on the third ring, pausing before I could\nget any of the words to come out of my mouth but I mustered up my\ncourage eventually and gave him my prepared spiel. Beginning with how\nmuch I had appreciated everything he has done for me up until this point.\nT hoped he would be understanding but he just wanted me to hurry up and\nget to the point. Trying to contagiously pass on my excitement through\nthe phone lines, I finally screamed out “I’m getting married! Can you\nbelieve it?” No reply was given only a silence on the other end. Trying to\nmake some conversation ridding the uncomfortable silence, | went on to\ntell him about Robbie and how I had fallen madly in love with him over\nthe last amazing few days we'd spent together. The absence of sound\nmade my thoughts begin to run wild and to get some response | had to\nask him what he thought about everything I was telling him. Finally a few\nseconds later his reaction to the news sunk in and his only and final reply\n\n(1 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL\n\nGIUFFRE004259\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021207",
