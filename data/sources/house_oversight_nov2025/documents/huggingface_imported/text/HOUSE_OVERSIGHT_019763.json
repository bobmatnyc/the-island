  "text": "CHAPTER 27\nSnowden’s Choices\n\nIt is the choices we make that show who we truly are.\n\n—J. K. ROWLING, Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone\n\nUSSIAN AUTHORITIES had the opportunity to thoroughly\n\ndebrief Snowden as to his motive for stealing state secrets,\nwhereas U.S. authorities did not. It cannot be assumed that he had\na single consistent motive in 2013. Snowden has shown, if nothing\nelse, that he was adaptable to changing circumstances. He might have\nbegun taking documents for one reason and found other reasons as\nhe proceeded in his quest. Many of the reported circumstances of his\nactivities, including his probes, contacts, theft, and escape, are dis-\nputed by his supporters. Many of his other activities are shrouded\nby the secrecy of the NSA. We do know, though, that Snowden made\nfour extraordinary choices during the nine-month period in 2013. If,\nas is said, actions speak louder than words, Snowden’s four choices\nilluminate the underlying concerns guiding his acts. In the case of a\nclassified intelligence breach, as in the post-action analysis of a mas-\nterful chess game, the sequence of moves a player makes provides an\nimportant clue to his strategy. Let us review what we have already\nlearned about these decisions.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r.indd 275 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019763",
