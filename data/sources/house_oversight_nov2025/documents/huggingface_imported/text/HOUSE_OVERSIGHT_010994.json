Chapter 2 showed why.\nWeare probably more comfortable to think of income as something known which\n\nwe can slice into consumption and saving slices as we like. Less of one would mean\nthat much more of the other. That would put us in charge. We can always consume\n\nless by will power. If less consumption meant more growth, we could grow at will.\n\nKeynes showed otherwise by invoking the old paradox of thrift. If everyone put\nmoney in vaults instead of consuming, consumption would go down while money\npiled up. But the added money would find less output to buy with it, as nothing new\nwas created to compensate for the drop in consumption. The value of the piled-up\nmoney would vanish in inflation. Saving would equal investment in the end because\n\nboth disappeared. The Y = C + I equation shows the math. It say that less\n\nChapter 4 Mill’s Idea 1/11/16 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010994",
