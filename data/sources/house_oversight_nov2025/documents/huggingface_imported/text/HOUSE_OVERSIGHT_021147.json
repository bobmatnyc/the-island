  "text": "of life was just mind blowing to even comprehend at first. With such a\nnew outlook of the world to try and grasp at my young age I was listening\nto every word spoken to me with such attentiveness, I was going to try\nand mode! what I was observing from the girls. I justified their way of\nthinking in my head for now, thinking if all these girls seem happy\nenough, why couldn’t I try to be, it was this or the streets for me.\n\nRon came back for me not long after our conversation got out of hand\nand took me to a bathroom down the hall. He opened the tap and filled a\nsmall plastic cup with water and handed me two small blue oval pills.\nTelling me to take them both as they would help me to relax a little bit\nmore. I swallowed the pills just following his orders. I put the cup on the\ncounter top and turned back around to face him. Backing me up against\nthe wall and now cornered by this large man I felt his slithering hands\nbegan to creep under my shirt, writhing my skin. 1 closed my eyes tightly\nand turned my head away from him, hoping he would take my actions as\na sign of being extremely uncomfortable but that wouldn’t bother him at\nall. He was half enjoying my reaction from the smug look on his face,\nand persisted through it.\n\nContinuing to undress my clothes he said he wanted to look me over\nand clean me up. It was so humiliating having to expose myself to this\nageing man and now I knew he was going to end up with his hands and\nwhatever else all over me. All too soon | hated to be right, as I stood\nnaked before his widened eyes, he told me “you’re a hairy bugger PII\nhave to shave you right up young lady”, and I didn’t know he wasn’t just\ntalking about my legs. Standing with my legs wide apart while this man\ncoaxed me through the entire ordeal of shaving, his hands made me feel\nso dirty. “Have I lost my mind?” I thought to myself but I had to play\nnice until { had an opportunity to get away, this was not as fun as the girls\nmade it out to be after all, this was utterly disgusting. I had no idea what\nwas going to happen next with this guy, and due to whatever\npharmaceuticals he gave me, I still don’t know to this day.\n\nWaking up the next morning my head was pounding in an agonizing\nthumping pain and I was so thirsty. The satin sheets thankfully covered\nmy body, which was still nude from the night before, and T could hear\nhushed voices standing over the bed where I was pretending to still be\nasleep. Listening in on their conversation T kept my eyes shut. I knew\nRon’s voice from two of the men but not recognizing the other guys I just\nstayed quiet hoping they’d soon leave. Ron was telling the other man\nwhat atrocities he got up to the night before with me and I heard him say,\n“Doesn't she even look like an ange! the way she sleeps? She’s my own\nlittle angel!” He exclaimed proudly. | opened my eyes and rolled over to\nface them both having to wrap the sheets over my body, really not\nknowing what to say except “Good-morning” in a blushful tone. Ron\n\n11 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004 138\n\nintroduced me to his business partner and told to go get dressed. He had\nmy whole day planned out for me already. Booked into get my hair\ncolored, a much lighter tint of blonde, and afterwards a day of shopping\nwith the girls I was becoming exactly what he wanted me too, a carbon\ncopy of the teenage Barbie... only I wasn’t plastic and came with many\nbenefits.\n\nDays tured into weeks, being a servant to the sexual desires of this\ndistorted pervert. I dreamt of escaping but where would I go and how\nwould I get away from Ron with him controlling my every second of my\nday. Separating myself from the other girls being so uncomfortable with\nenduring the everyday occurrences I was longing for the solitude of the\nbeach again. They were training me up to be an escort prodigy or\nsomething like it. Outrageous orgies were conducted as my lessons with\nthe girls teaching me all of their tricks in the game, it was all for the sake\nof men’s perverted fantasies, they didn’t get anything from being sexually\nexploited and molesting each other, except getting paid for it. Everything\nfrom oral sex too penetration with toys, | was expected to not only to join\nin but even perform ludicrous acts of hedonism.\n\n1 was Thirteen years old and had never heard the terminology of these\nsexual acts before, and definitely shouldn’t have been learning them first\nhand. Thrown into a world of chaos, | didn’t know what to do except be\nas compliant as possible, even when asked to do the most degrading\ntasks. The excitement of the lifestyle he offered quickly diminished once\nI had to pay so dearly for it. The girls that subdued to this lifestyle and\nenjoyed it definitely put on a good act, but no little girl with hopes and\ndreams of their untainted future, turns to her mother and say’s “one day |\ndream of being a prostitute, passed around from man to man, only to\ngrow older regretting so much of my life” It was all a part of an illusion\nthat Ron painted for us that made it seem so alluring in the first place.\n\nSpending my days with Ron, he took advantage at every chance given.\nEven in his convertible with the top down I would be forced to go topless\nwhile he drove around, when I asked him why one day, it was supposedly\nso I could maintain an even suntan, but I knew it was his way of showing\noff his treasures. It was a far cry from the simple country life Thad been\nraised in. Wearing designer miniskirts and tops that always revealed too\nmuch, of course due to Ron and the girls determining everything I wore,\nate, or spoke. We would spend our days at hair laser clinics, shopping,\ntanning beds, and eating as little as possible. Through the nights we were\nexpected to become party animals and greet Ron’s clientele with the\nupmost flirtatious attention and doting as possible. Then whether we were\nout for dinner, at a party, or ata club, the men would choose his girl and\ntake her home. Every girl had a different price and so did the charges\ndepending on the various clienteles but Ron always kept me for himself.\n\nOD Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUTEREGO4 139\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021147",
