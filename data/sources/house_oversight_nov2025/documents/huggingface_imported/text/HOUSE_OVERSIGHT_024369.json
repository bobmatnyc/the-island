In connection with these contributions, we have made corresponding grants of 165 restricted stock units under our 2017 Omnibus Incentive\nPlan to each employee who has satisfied the requirements and intend to make grants to the remaining then-existing employees as they satisfy the\nrequirements (the “100k Milestone Gift” or “Gift”). Under U.S. GAAP, the 100k Milestone Gift is treated as compensation expense, a portion of which\nrelates to the production of our used vehicle inventory and is therefore capitalized to inventory and subsequently recognized within costs of sales when the\nrelated inventory is sold.\n\nNON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES\n\nTo supplement the consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP, we also present the\nfollowing non-GAAP measures: gross profit ex-Gift, gross profit per unit ex-Gift, EBITDA ex-Gift, and EBITDA margin ex-Gift. We believe the\npresentation of both GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures provides investors with increased transparency into financial measures used by our\nmanagement team, and it also improves investors’ understanding of our underlying operating performance and their ability to analyze our ongoing operating\ntrends. All historic non-GAAP financial measures have been reconciled with the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.\n\nGROSS PROFIT EX-GIFT AND GROSS PROFIT PER UNIT EX-GIFT\n\nGross profit ex-Gift and gross profit per unit ex-Gift are non-GAAP supplemental measures of operating performance that do not represent and\nshould not be considered an alternative to gross profit, as determined by GAAP. Gross profit ex-Gift is defined as gross profit before compensation expense\nrelated to the 100k Milestone Gift included in cost of sales. Gross profit per Unit ex-Gift is Gross Profit ex-Gift divided by units sold. We use Gross Profit\nex-Gift to measure the operating performance of our business and Gross Profit per Unit ex-Gift to measure our operating performance relative to our units\nsold. We believe that Gross Profit ex-Gift and Gross Profit per Unit ex-Gift are useful measures to us and to our investors because they exclude the expense\nassociated with the 100k Milestone Gift recognized in cost of sales. We expect the 100k Milestone Gift to be a one-time award program for which we will\nrecognize varying amounts of expense beginning in the second half of 2018 and continuing through the first half of 2020, and therefore we believe the\nrelated expense does not reflect our core operations, is not included in our past operations, and may not be indicative of our future operations. Additionally,\nthe shares issued to settle the 100k Milestone Gift are offset by share contributions from Mr. Garcia to Carvana, therefore we expect the impact on shares\noutstanding to be nearly zero. We believe that excluding it enables us to more effectively evaluate our performance period-over-period and relative to our\ncompetitors.\n\n- 60 -\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024369",
