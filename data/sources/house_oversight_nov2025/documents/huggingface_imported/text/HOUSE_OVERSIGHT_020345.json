  "text": "193\n\n“There is only one door to Snowden,” Zamir wrote me. “His name is Kucherena.” Since\nZamir said Kucherena rarely saw journalists he that he had a contact in his office. He further told\nme Kucherena required that any journalist seeking an interview with Snowden to submit his\nquestions to him two weeks in advance and, if approved, sign a document stating I would not\ndeviate from the questions. Next, my questions had to be translated from English to Russian\n(even though Snowden does not speak Russian) and then vetted by Kucherena’s staff. Zamir\nalso suggested I stay at the National hotel in Red Square because Snowden has gone there for\nprevious meetings with Bamford. So I sent Kucherena, via Zamir, ten questions that might\ninterest Snowden (if they ever reached him.)\n\nI next obtained a multi-entry Russian visa from the Russian consulate in New York, booked\nmyself a room in the National hotel with a view of the Kremlin and used all my remaining\nfrequent travel miles to book a direct flight on Aeroflot to Moscow.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020345",
