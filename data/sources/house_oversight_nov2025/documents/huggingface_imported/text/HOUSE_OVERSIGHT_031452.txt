Do you mind if I pass Petrella's contact on to a political reporter? I won't do it unless you say OK
because after that I would have no say as to where story goes. Let me know -- its not a big deal for me
either way. But at some point this stuff will come out -- as long he continues to top polls.

Now everyone coming to me thinking I have juicy info on you and Trump.

Because of this.

"T've known Jeff for fifteen years. Terrific guy," Trump booms from a speakerphone. "He's a lot of fun to be with. It is
even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it -
- Jeffrey enjoys his social life."

That story will never die.
