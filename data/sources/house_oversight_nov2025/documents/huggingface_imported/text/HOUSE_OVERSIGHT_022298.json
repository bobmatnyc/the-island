As a result, those\nemployees not listed under the\nexclusions will reasonably believe they\nare covered employees under the\nstatute. Any employees who are unsure\nof their status should contact a regional\noffice of the NLRB.\n\nThe final notice as modified is set\nforth in the Appendix to Subpart A of\nthis rule.\n\n2. Posting Issues\n\nThe Board proposed that the notice to\nemployees shall be at least 11 inches by\n17 inches in size, and in such colors and\ntype size and style as the Board shall\nprescribe. The proposed rule further\nprovides that employers that choose to\nprint the notice after downloading it\nfrom the Board’s Web site must print in\ncolor, and the printed notice shall be at\nleast 11 inches by 17 inches in size.\n\nProposed § 104.202(d) requires all\ncovered employers to post the employee\nnotice physically “in conspicuous\nplaces, including all places where\nnotices to employees are customarily\nposted.” Employers must take steps to\nensure that the notice is not altered,\ndefaced, or covered with other material.\nProposed § 104.202(e) states that the\nBoard will print the notice poster and\nprovide copies to employers on request.\nIt also states that employers may\ndownload copies of the poster from the\nBoard’s Web site, http://www.nirb.gov,\nfor their use. It further provides that\nemployers may reproduce exact\nduplicates of the poster supplied by the\nBoard, and that they may also use\ncommercial poster services to provide\nthe employee notice consolidated onto\none poster with other Federally\nmandated labor and employment\nnotices, as long as consolidation does\nnot alter the size, color, or content of the\nposter provided by the Board. Finally,\nemployers that have significant numbers\nof employees who are not proficient in\nEnglish will be required to post notices\nof employee rights in the language or\nlanguages spoken by significant\nnumbers of those employees. The Board\nwill make available posters containing\nthe necessary translations.\n\nIn addition to requiring physical\nposting of paper notices, proposed\n§ 104.202(f) requires that notices be\ndistributed electronically, such as by e-\nmail, posting on an intranet or an\ninternet site, and/or other electronic\nmeans, if the employer customarily\ncommunicates with its employees by\n\nsuch means.' An employer that\ncustomarily posts notices to its\nemployees on an intranet or internet site\nmust display the required employee\nnotice on such a site prominently—i.e.,\nno less prominently than other notices\nto employees. The Board proposed to\ngive employers two options to satisfy\nthis requirement. An employer may\neither download the notice itself and\npost it in the manner described above,\nor post, in the same manner, a link to\nthe Board’s Web site that contains the\nfull text of the required employee\nnotice. In the latter case, the proposed\nrule states that the link must contain the\nprescribed introductory language from\nthe poster, which appears in Appendix\nto Subpart A, below. An employer that\ncustomarily communicates with its\nemployees by e-mail will satisfy the\nelectronic posting requirement by\nsending its employees an e-mail\nmessage containing the link described\nabove.\n\nThe proposed rule provides that,\nwhere a Significant number of an\nemployer’s employees are not proficient\nin English, the employer must provide\nthe required electronic notice in the\nlanguage the employees speak. This\nrequirement can be met either by\ndownloading and posting, as required in\n§ 104.202(f), the translated version of\nthe notice supplied by the Board, or by\nprominently displaying, as required in\n§ 104.202(f), a link to the Board’s Web\nsite that contains the full text of the\nposter in the language the employees\nspeak. The Board will provide\ntranslations of that link. 75 FR 80417.\n\nSection 104.203 of the proposed rule\nprovides that Federal contractors may\ncomply with the requirements of the\ntule by posting the notices to employees\nrequired under the Department of\nLabor’s notice-posting rule, 29 CFR part\n471. Id.\n\nThe Board solicited comments on its\nproposed requirements for both physical\nand electronic notice posting. In\naddition, the Board solicited comments\non whether it should prescribe\nstandards regarding the size, clarity,\nlocation, and brightness of the\nelectronic link, including how to\nprescribe electronic postings that are at\nleast as large, clear, and conspicuous as\nthe employer’s other postings.\n\nThe Board received numerous\ncomments concerning the technical\nrequirements for posting the notices of\nemployee rights. Those comments\naddress the locations where notices\nwould be physically posted, physical\ncharacteristics of the posters,\n\n111 See J. Picini Flooring, 356 NLRB No. 9, slip op.\nat 6 (2010).\n\nrequirements for posting in languages\nother than English, details of the\nrequirement for electronic posting of\nnotices by employers that customarily\ncommunicate with their employees\nelectronically, and “safe harbor’\nprovisions for Federal contractors that\nare already posting the Department of\nLabor’s notice of NLRA rights.\n\na. Location of Posting\n\nSection 104.202(d) of the proposed\nrule requires that the notice be posted\n“in conspicuous places, including all\nplaces where notices to employees are\ncustomarily posted.’ Some employers\nand their representatives, including law\nfirm Baker & McKenzie, comment that\nthe proposed rule does not define\n“customarily.” The Board responds that\nthe term is used in its normal meaning\nof “ordinarily” or “usually,” as it has\nbeen used in the Board’s remedial\norders for decades.112 This standard is\nconsistent with the posting\nrequirements in the regulations and\nstatutes of other agencies.113 Baker &\nMcKenzie’s comment contends that the\nquoted phrase should read instead\n“where other legally-required notices to\nemployees are customarily posted.’’ The\nBoard disagrees. As under the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice posting\nrequirement,‘ the Board’s final rule\nclarifies that the notice must be posted\nwherever notices to employees\nregarding personnel rules and policies\nare customarily posted and are readily\nseen by employees, not simply where\nother legally mandated notices are\nposted.\n\nA number of comments from\nemployers 115 and individuals take the\nposition that it is time to move away\nfrom paper posters and to encourage\nemployees to inform themselves of their\nrights through the Internet. Many\ncomments object that the posting\nrequirement will add to already\ncluttered bulletin boards or necessitate\nadditional bulletin boards.11® The Board\nresponds to these comments above in\nsection II, subsection C, Factual Support\nfor the Rule.
