The site grew at a tremendous pace, quickly becoming a $1.2 billion enterprise where\nyou could buy or sell drugs, hacking software, forged passports, counterfeit cash, guns, grenades, and poisons.\n\nThe Silk Road soon caught the attention of the Feds, who embarked on an epic two-year manhunt for the site’s\nproprietor. Ulbricht, in the meantime, struggled to maintain control of his double life and his marketplace, which\nhe originally started to prove that legalizing drugs could make society safer. He gradually abandoned his\nlibertarian ideals to rule Silk Road with increasingly authoritarian force. At one point, he engaged the services of\nhired hit men to take out employees he felt had wronged him. Soon, some of the Federal agents who were\nsupposed to be hunting for Ulbricht were lured into the dark world and switched sides to join him.\n\nNICK BILTON is a special correspondent for Vanity Fair, where he writes about technology, business, and\nculture, and a contributor at CNBC.

Norton, China— Huazhang, Audio — Audible; Manuscript; Pub Date: April 2017;\n304 pages]\n\nPioneering neuroscientist Dean Buonomano examines how the brain tells time, predicts the future, and\nunderstands the past in a book that straddles the fields of physics, psychology and neuroscience.\n\nFew questions are as perplexing and profound as those that relate to ttme. Philosophers ponder what time is.\nPhysicists grapple with why time appears to be a one-way street, and debate whether it is a single lonely point or\na full-blown dimension. Neuroscientists and psychologists struggle to understand what it means to \"feel\" the\npassage of time and how the brain tells it. Time 1s also key to the question of free will: is the future an open\npath, or is 1t preordained by the past?\n\nThe brain, argues Buonomano, is at its core a time machine. It 1s the brain's ability to anticipate the actions of\nprey, predators, and mates, and to predict when events will occur in a dynamically changing world, that\nultimately translate into the evolutionary currency of survival and reproduction.\n\nThe ability of animals to predict the future culminated with Homo sapiens' capacity to grasp the concept of time.\nOnly then were we able to craft a blade for future use, or plant a seed to quench projected hunger.\n\nYour Brain is a Time Machine explains that, in the end, our intuitions and theories about time reveal as much\nabout the architecture and limitations of our brains as they do about the true nature of time.\n\nDEAN BUONOMANDO is a professor in the Departments of Neurobiology and Psychology at UCLA, and an\ninvestigator in the Integrative Center for Learning and Memory. He is the author of Brain Bugs: How the Brain’s\nFlaws Shape Our Lives, which was a Wall Street Journal bestseller, and his research has been highlighted in\nmany national and international magazines and newspapers, including Discover, Newsweek, Scientific American,\nZeit, Cosmos, Hérzu Wissen, and the New Yorker.\n\nBrockman, Inc.
