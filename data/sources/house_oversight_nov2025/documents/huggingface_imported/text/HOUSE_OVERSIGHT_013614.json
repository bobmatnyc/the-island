  "text": "Octahedral Air people intellectualize objectively in confident and insensitive\naloofness. Those symbolized by cubic Earth are realistic and practical, a what-you-\nsee-is-what-there-is belief along with rigid, materialistic ways. /cosahedral Water\ntypes experience emotions strongly and are sensitive, intuitive, nurturing and can be\noverly sensitive and dependent.\n\nWhat intuitions and observations relevant to self, subjective and objective,\nemanate from the stylistic properties of feelings as derived from a time series of\nobservations of their associated actions suggested by their statistical measures, Hr,\nHu, AC and srs? The yield is rich and unexpected. We find an enjoining of values of\nthese measures, characteristic and invariant for each person, with the brain and\nbehavioral actions of entheogenic agents and Zen meditation in contrast with\nworldlier focused attitude adjusting experiences and drugs. The range of their\npotential values helps rationalize a person’s inclinations along the continuum of\nattachment and detachment. This quantifiable dimension augers positively and\nnegatively with respect to the requirements for mystical experience as poetically\ndescribed by the ambivalent warrior prince, Ardjuna, in conversations with Lord\nKrishna in the Bhagavad-Gita, the most famous and influential component of the\nMahabharata of Hindu scripture, A similar theme relevant to the occupancy of a\npropitious range of values for the measures, H7, Hy, AC and srs, is found in what is\noften called the Second Nobe/ Truth as explained by the Buddha, Siddhartha\nGautama, in lectures recorded in a deer park near Benares. We begin with the\nresults of some drug experiments conducted by behavioral neurophysiologists and\nend with suggestions about the intuitive relevance of the conceptual content of\nthese measures to the universals of mystical experience and perhaps to elements\nof spiritual transformation.\n\nAs described previously, the brain and behavioral process of habituation is\ncharacterized by a decrease in the strength of an observable response to the\nrepetition of an evocative stimulus. Imagine the decrease in our startle responding\nwhen a once unexpected loud noise continues to occur. Sir Charles Sherrington,\nthe early Twentieth Century British pioneer in neurophysiology showed that animals\n\nand humans gradually stopped the withdrawal of their limbs with stimulation of its\n\n114\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013614",
