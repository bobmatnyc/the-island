  "text": "Free Will 349\n\nLet us say the Mars particle chooses its answer because of an\nexternal influence. Its Hubble twin must choose the same answer. There\nis no problem with this because the Hubble particle could have made its\ndecision before the Mars particle, so the decision was not predetermined.\n\nBut in another frame of reference the choice is made in the opposite\nsequence. The Hubble particle chooses after the Mars particle. This is\npredetermination and it breaks the Kochen-Specker theorem.\n\nYou can reverse the whole analysis and see the same problem from\nthe other point of view. There is a paradox here however you look at it.\n\nThe only solution to the paradox is that both particles make their\nchoice without any information from an outside source; particles have\nfree will. This means at least one new piece of information spontaneously\nappears in the Universe — a ‘bit’ of free will, so to speak.\n\nYou might think there is a problem because the first particle affects\nits twin, even if the second did not receive any outside influence. This\nwould result in the Kochen-Specker paradox reemerging. There is a\nneat way out of this; time has no meaning for the particles. Or, I should\nsay, relative time has no meaning and, therefore, has no effect. There is\nno concept of before or after between the particles. They live in a little\nbubble of space-time where the order of events has no meaning. The\nparticles make their free choice together within this safe bubble, and the\nparadox is avoided. When we come to measure them, we see they both\nmade a random decision together, but if we ask which made it first, the\nquestion has no meaning. There is no clock valid for both particles, so\nthere is no possible answer to the question.\n\nConway and Kochen have proven sub-atomic particles have free will\n— or at least entangled bosons do. At this point, their argument becomes\na philosophical one. They propose that these particles pass on this free\nwill to larger entities in the Universe and ultimately to us. Although\nparticles are small and insignificant, they are the fundamental building\nblocks of nature, and the butterfly effect multiplies up tiny variations in\nthe microscopic world into the macroscopic events we see.\n\nAlthough their theorem is very elegant, we still have to address the\nquestion of whether the experimenter has the true freedom to run the\nexperiment in the first place: the determined determinist argument.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016039",
