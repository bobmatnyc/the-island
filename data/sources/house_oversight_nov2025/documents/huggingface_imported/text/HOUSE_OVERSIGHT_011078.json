My own analysis allows\nmore role for group selection, without saying how much, and shifts attention from\n\nwho benefits to when.\n\nPetty’s idea, if | understand him, is\nyears purchase = generation length = 21years, (7.5)\n\nwhich would give\n\n1\ngeneration length 21 years\n\ncash flow rate = 4.7% /year.

Petty’s primogeniture\nmodel may have been true to law and custom for land inheritance, but it is not true\nto biology. I prefer R. A. Fisher’s? method equal-weighting all births from first to last,\nand equal-weighing ages of both parents at each birth. We have some evidence that\nthe maternal generation length in recent decades, by that method, has run near 26\nyears over recent decades.
