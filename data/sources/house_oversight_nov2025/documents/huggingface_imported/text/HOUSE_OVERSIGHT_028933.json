A wide area of agreement, but not total.\n\nOn confronting dogma, | of course agree — though in my opinion the secular religions — nationalist fanaticism, etc. — are\nmuch more dangerous. And if some find rational discussion offensive — as, for example, mainstream academics find\ndismantling myths of “American exceptionalism” or “Israeli self-defense” or Obama’s mass murder campaign, etc.,\noffensive — so be it.\n\nBut | don’t see why that should extend to ridicule. That includes astrologists. Astronomers can refute astrology, while\nrecognizing that perfectly honest and deluded people may believe it and should be treated with respect, while their\nbeliefs are confronted with evidence. | also don’t see why we should ridicule religious dogma, just as | don’t think we\nshould ridicule the much more pernicious secular dogmas. Rather, we should respond to irrational belief with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028933",
