  "text": "“Why we camp out here? I find that question as mysterious as you\ndo,” says Weingarten.\n\nShortly after Weingarten leaves, Epstein tells me that Eric Holder will\nresign by the end of the week—which he does.\n\nEpstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-\nroom. It’s a young man named Brook Pierce, a former child actor, and\ndotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a\nnotorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading\ninvestor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as the “the most active investor in\nthe field.”\n\nAnd, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin.\nIt is so good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment\nis here. And seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and\nPresident of Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs\ndeep into the Shakes chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.\n\n“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here.\nBut an additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking 1s that\nthe worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you\nput into it. Whereas, I could go—I mean I don’t look that great now—but I\ncould go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence\nto being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity...”\n\n“Well,” says Pierce in what in some dramatic understatement, “you\nare going to have some low quality characters playing the space...”\n\nThat evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the former\nPrime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjorn Jaglandthe head\nof the Noble Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but general\nscathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace\nPrize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet.\n\nThe next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister\nand Israel, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omelet, able to defend both\nObama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White\nHouse Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney\ngeneral, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with\nEpstein.\n\nLarry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches American\npoetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry\nthat WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she\nmight go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget).\n\nMORE...TK\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022733",
