These fault\nlines were discussed in detail in our December\n2013 Insight, Emerging Markets: As the\nTide Goes Out.\n\nWe continue to recommend a zero allocation\nto emerging market debt (dollar-denominated\nand local currency debt) and a 2% allocation\nto emerging market equities in a moderate-risk\ndiversified portfolio. We highlight emerging market\nassets because, yet again, our base case returns,\nespecially for emerging market equities, appear\ncompelling, but we are not recommending a\ntactical allocation to this asset class. As we discuss\nbelow in our review of the risks to our economic\nand financial market outlook, China is our biggest\nsource of concern in 2017 and for the next few\nyears. Emerging markets are the countries that\nwould be most negatively impacted by any shocks\nemanating from China.\n\nChina is our biggest source of\nconcern in 2017 and for the next\nfew years. Emerging markets are\nthe countries that would be most\nnegatively impacted by any shocks\nemanating from China.\n\nOur 2017 expected returns, shown in Exhibit\n22, are the lowest returns we have published since\nthe global financial crisis. Not a single broad asset\nclass is expected to have double-digit returns. Cash\nhas an expected return of 1%. Expected returns\nfor intermediate investment grade fixed income\nsecurities range between 0% and 1% depending\non maturities, an expectation driven by our view of\nrising rates as the Federal Reserve hikes the federal\nfunds rate two or three times in 2017. US equities,\nwhich are the most expensive of global equities,\nhave an expected return of about 3%, and we\nexpect slightly higher returns in other developed\nmarket equities. Hedge funds, an asset class for\nwhich we have had modest single-digit return\nexpectations since our 2013 Outlook (as shown in\nExhibit 21), should continue to have modest returns;\nwe expect a 3% return before taxes, compared to a\n5% annualized return expectation in 2013 and an\nannualized return of 3% over the last four years.\n\nIn aggregate, a moderate-risk diversified\nportfolio for taxable clients is expected to\nhave a return of about 3%. We must note\nthat our return expectations are not meant\nto promote a specific investment, and\n\nthat their basis on current capital market\nassumptions implies they will likely\nchange over the course of the year.\n\nAt this point, our clients may well be\nasking why they should remain invested\nin a diversified portfolio with such paltry\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 23\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014556",
