  "text": "conclusions. There is no smoking gun beyond the often flagrant, custom-\nbreaking, events of the President's 16 months in office. Indeed, much of\nthe evidence is based on the President's public statements and tweets\nabout those events. \"This indictment could have been drafted without\nanyone being interviewed,\" said one source. This is, from the\nperspective of White House sources good news: the case then, is just an\nissue of what motives are ascribed to the President's behavior—\nbehavior that is, the President's supporters believe it is easy to show,\nimpulsive and not thought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it\nis precisely that careless behavior and flagrant disregard for\nconstitutional standards that they hope-to put on trial.\n\nAccording to a source involved in the Mueller strategy, the plan to\nindict the President is now \"more advanced\" than it was when the terms\nof the indictment were agreed in April. In the intervening months, the\npresident’s lawyers, spokespersons and surrogates have staged a very\npublic debate about whether such a legal proceeding would be\nconstitutional—in effect trying to discredit, ahead of time, any\nprosecutorial action the Special Counsel’s office might take. This may be\na preemptive response to an indictment they expect is forthcoming. It\nmay also be an effort to pressure Rosenstein. It may even be an effort to\nconvince Mueller of that, since some in the White House believe that\nthat the plan to indict is not a strategy yet embraced by the whole\nSpecial Counsel’s office, but one that is being advocated only by its most\nvirulently anti-Trump purists on the investigative team—most notably\nby the number two lawyer under Mueller, Andrew Weissmann.\n\nIt may be noteworthy that there appears now not to be plan for an\nindictment related to collusion, although, legal experts say, that could\ncome later and may depend on new information from the investigation\nof the President's personal attorney, Michael Cohen. It is also possible\nthat alternative plans have been made—preparation for more expansive\nindictments, for instance, or for a broader report that would include the\nallegations of obstruction but not seek to indict the President.\n\nThe White House view is that without the underlying collusion\ncharge—\"real collusion,\" in the words of one White House advisor, “and\nnot just a bunch of Facebook ads and some trolls\"—Mueller will be\npresenting a weak and politically-motivated case. \"That's a witch hunt,\"\nsaid the advisor. The view of the Mueller team, or at least that of its\nmost ardent members, seems to be that the obstruction charges go to\nthe very heart of exposing how Trump has abused his power and turned\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030259",
