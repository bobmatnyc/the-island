  "text": "The United Arab Emirates, on its own or through the GCC, the Arab League and the specialized international\ninstitutions, plays an integral role on this front. The capitalist system did not fail. What has failed is the\nexcessive economic liberalism, which pushed to minimize the intervention of the regulatory government\ninstitutions in the markets and banks’ activities.\n\nCertainly the world is witnessing the birth of a new economic and financial order. The results of the G20\nsummit are a prelude toward this end. However, consensus on the format and the content of this new global\neconomic system would not be reached soon. Different factors determine the future of this system, including\ngrowing global competition and conflicting national economic interests. No party would easily give up its\nposition and gains for the benefit of the global economy recovery.\n\nAs for the suggestion on the Islamic banking, it is of interest to the global banking sector. However, to be a\nsubstitute to the current economic systems, even if only temporarily, is a much more complex approach, which\nrelates to the nature of economic systems, the size of the economies of nations, and the size of Islamic banks in\nthe banking sector worldwide. As you are aware, there are a lot of factors that govern this, such as the\ndistribution of the economic, military, scientific and social powers in the world, as well as the competitive\nnature of civilizations, and the strong links between the civilizations and religions.\n\nBy Thabet Amin Awad of Al Ahram Egyptian newspaper\n\nThere are many other positive aspects of the global financial crisis which were embodied\nin refining the current competencies, reviewing the need for expatriate expertise, and\nstrengthening the bonds of the federal entities that supported the UAE. In your opinion,\nwhat are the lessons learned from this crisis both on the local and federal level?\n\nThere are many lessons to be learned from the crisis, the most important one being the assertion of the state’s\nrole in regulating and monitoring the overall economy and markets, and confirming the fact of the global\neconomy’s unity, in addition to the unification of the global market. The widening scope of the crisis, which\nincludes all parts of the world, confirms this unity and the common international pursuit. In addition, President\nObama’s public statement, which verifies that the United States cannot overcome the global crisis on its own, is\nfurther confirmation of the unity of the economy and the market. Other lessons learned from the=2 Ocrisis is\nrealizing the urgent need to develop the regulations, terms of reference and working mechanisms of\ninternational financial institutions to be commensurate with the unified markets and economies, and the\ninvolvement of many influential players.\n\nIn the United Arab Emirates, we perform a wide range of reviews through specialized federal and local\ncommittees which are well aware that within the challenges of the crisis, remain many opportunities. The first\nopportunity to be seized is to benefit from the lessons learned from the crisis, and be prepared to deal efficiently\nwith the world after the crisis; a world completely different than what it was before. As for the forces of federal\nentities, the fact is that the strength of these entities is what enabled them to cope with the crisis and contain its\nnegative effects.\n\nBy Thabet Amin Awad of Al Ahram Egyptian newspaper\n\nYou have said that \"our vision is clear, our goals are obvious, our strengths are great, our\nwill is strong and we are ready. We want Dubai to be a global center of excellence,\ncreativity and leadership, and we are able to achieve excellence, creativity and\nleadership.\" Do you still stand by your vision?
