To quote the late Supreme Court Justice William\nBrennan: \"any prosecutor worth his salt could indict a ham sandwich.\"\"\n\nThis means all evidence, regardless of its sanibigupns nature, will be interpreted to support their\nassumption of wrongdoing.\n\nThey will be using software to go through millions of E-mail messages to look for key words. As Buddy\nhas quoted me: \"\"The 'E’ in E-mail stands for evidence.\"”\n\nSix months from now they uncover an E-mail from the County Manager to Walton stating that\nCommissioner X wants te know if the bid of company Y for new busses was correctly filled out. He\nreplies that it was.\n\nMonths later he has totally forgotten about the innocuous Eumail. Based on the merits, he happens to\nrank Y's bid number one.\n\n“You can bet as sure as “J . Edgar Hoover wore pink poodle skirts, the FBI will conclude this was code\nfrom Commissioner X to Walton to vote for Y.\n\nArmed with the E-mail you can be damn sure that the G-Men will be back threatening him with\neverything including a stint in Gitmo.\n\n_All of this might have been avoided if he had followed my three basic rules.\nMermorize them. | |\n1. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.\n2. Do not talk to the FBI without a lawyer.\n\n3. Do not talk to the FBI without a law\n\nGrant J.
