They fused often fantastic technical skill with the hacker’s instinct for\ncontrol - admixed with a criminal’s hunger for profit.\n\nThe first computer viruses and worms were part of what they sold. These had\nappeared in the 1980s, mostly as curious intellectual exercises. There was a desire\namong computer engineers, a scientific sort of craving, to see what might be done on\nthe systems they had built. It was not unlike those whistling telephone tones that\nhad so fascinated Cap’n Crunch and Steve Jobs and Woz. Could you make the big\nroom-sized machines twitch in ways no one had imagined? Absolute, undeniable\nthrill ran through this sort of activity. I can still recall returning to my office one day\nin the mid-1990s with a Ziploc-bag that contained a floppy disk marked “Viruses”\nwhich I used to promptly break my computer so completely it had to be\nreformatted. Twice. Such adventures, however, were also producing some of the\nbest programmers of my generation. Managing tricks inside those early systems\nrequired then, as it does now, a profound intimacy with the code defining their\nelectrical operations. (Computer programs are called “code”; people who write and\ntest them are “coders”.)\n\nBut the secret moves behind those early cracks and exploits were rarely secret for\nlong. The informal culture of stapled together magazines like 2600 told you what\nyou needed to know about this band: It was a group that liked to share, to brag, to\nindulge each other in stories about systems they had cracked open, to play with a bit\nof light paranoia about who might be watching you and who might care. Computers.\nSystems. That’s my bag. You might as well spread some of the adrenaline rush of\nyour adventure with others. The sense of a “shared alternate reality” most of us had\nfirst experienced in games like Dungeons and Dragons or the pages of Dune fit nicely\ninto the digital world. This open, friendly temperament animated most of the people\nspread across that Amsterdam field, jumping into the lake instead of showers,\ntalking math, buzzing at each other like a fridge. We had the programmer’s raw\nfascination about what a machine might be made to do, even in ways that were\ndeeply unintended. We were harmless. The Warez Dudes, however, were different.\nTheir fascination was a greedy, nasty obsession.\n\n2.\n\nThe business of playing with and inside of connected computer systems was, even\nas we sat on that Amsterdam summer lawn, shifting. It was slipping from earnest\nhobbyists and system managers to something a bit more sinister. We had just begun\nusing a new phrase, “malware,” to describe the malicious software that took\nadvantage of Postel’s “be liberal” instinct in order to devastate connected systems\nthat were filled with too many trusting, unlocked doors. It wasn’t merely the relaxed\nsystem design of the early ‘net or computer systems that made exploitation easy. It\nwas also that the networks and machines themselves were slipping with a kind of\nfrictionless momentum towards increasing complexity. This meant, invariably, that\npopular programs often shipped to users with mistakes or programming oversights\nthat invited hijack. The year before the Amsterdam conference, for instance, a cruel\nprogram known as “Michelangelo”, which would overwrite the data on hard disk\n\n95\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018327",
