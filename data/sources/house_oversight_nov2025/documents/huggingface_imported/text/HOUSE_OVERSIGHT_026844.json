  "text": "no contradiction. Indeed, China is now experiencing its own cultural\nrenaissance, fueled by its new affluence.\n\nThe duality of the Chinese story is reflected in the West's schizophrenic\nresponse to it. The Nixon administration eagerly sought better relations with\nChina under Mao, and when Deng Xiaoping doubled down by opening up\nthe country, the West applauded the change. The United States generously\naccepted Chinese products into its markets, allowed massive trade\nsurpluses, welcomed China into the World Trade Organization in 2001, and\nkept global sea-lanes open so that China could trade freely. All of this\nenabled China to emerge as the world's number one trading power by 2013.\nThe United States also generously allowed more than a million Chinese\nstudents to study in its universities.\n\nYet the rise of China has also led to deep fears. China continues to be run by\na communist party that has no desire to embrace liberal democracy. China\nhas displayed a belligerent side in some of its dealings with Japan and some\nmembers of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations over territorial\ndisputes in the East China and South China Seas. The possibility of an\naggressive, militaristic China cannot be ruled out.\n\nBut we have come a vast distance since the days when Mao openly talked\nabout the possibility of winning a nuclear war, and Chinese history suggests\nthat Beijing will ultimately prefer to join, rather than replace or reject, the\ncurrent rules-based order that the West has created. As the world's number\none trading power, China has the most to lose from a breakdown of the\nglobal economic system. Historically, moreover, what the Chinese have\nfeared most is luan (chaos). This might lead to heavy-handed efforts to\npreserve order domestically, but it should lead Beijing to support a rules-\nbased order at the global level as well. Undoubtedly, as China grows more\npowerful, it will become more assertive. This has happened. But since China\nneeds a few more decades of peace to complete its modernization, it has\nstrong reasons to restrain itself militarily and avoid a conflict.\n\nChinese society will never become a replica of Western society. China's own\nculture is too rich to be absorbed into any other cultural universe. Yet a\nmodernizing China will feature overlapping aspirations in many areas, as,\nfor example, with the rapid spread of Western classical music. In 2008, 36\nmillion Chinese children were studying the piano (six times the number of\nU.S. children doing so), and another 50 million were studying the violin.\nSome Chinese cities can fill the halls of 15 opera houses in one evening.\n\nA modern China with thriving Western classical orchestras and Western-\nstyle universities provides a powerful demonstration of the fusion of\ncivilizations. Western statesmen should allow this dynamic to gain\nmomentum while remaining patient on other areas of change, such as in the\npolitical realm. China's development will not necessarily be linear, but in the\nlong run, it should continue in a positive direction.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026844",
