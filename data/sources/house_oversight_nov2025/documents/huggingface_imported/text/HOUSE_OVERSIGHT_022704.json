In fact, the logs show\n\nall of Clinton’s flights came in 2002 and 2003, with not a single appearance aloft recorded in 2004 or 2005.\n\nThe closest potential link to Clinton in the period closer to Epstein’s fall, the public record suggests, comes from one of his\n\nlongtime confidants, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers.\n\nThe flight logs indicate Summers flew on Epstein’s jet as far back as 1998, but also on April 15, 2004, September 14, 2005, and\nDecember 21, 2005. The final trip came 10 days after Summers got married, and the log for the flight — from Bedford,\n\nMassachusetts, to the Virgin Islands — shows what appears to be his new bride on board, as well as Ghislaine Maxwell, but not\n\nEpstein.\na \\ 7 iM i ae —- = — Wer; GM Lan LARRY 4 LES x SummetsLV |\nwes} | Sd esy | Sep | hed NELNM ivi\n\nView this image >\nPalm Beach County Court\n\nEpstein was a significant donor to Harvard University, of which Summers was president at the time. According to a spokesperson\nfor Summers, on a few occasions when Epstein was flying to where Summers was also traveling, he accepted rides on the\n\nbillionaire’s jet.\n\nAttorneys in the two cases have attempted to get the court to permit discovery from Clinton himself, but have been stymied by\nmotions from Epstein’s lawyers. Court records show they have also tried unsuccessfully to depose Donald Trump, former New\nMexico Gov. Bill Richardson, former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola, and magician David Copperfield. Notably, a list of 73\n\nproposed witnesses in Roberts’ trial does not include Clinton.\n\nThe tale of Epstein and his sexual activities is undoubtedly a fascinating, and harrowing, one. But with the star witness in one case\nswearing under oath that she has no such evidence, and everyone else in a position to know keeping their mouths firmly shut, it is\nat this point extremely difficult to draw even a hazy, crooked, dotted line between Epstein’s depredations, in the bedroom or aloft,\n\nand William Jefferson Clinton.\n\nBuzzFeed News reporters Alex Campbell, Kyle Blaine, and Megan Apper contributed to this report.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022704",
