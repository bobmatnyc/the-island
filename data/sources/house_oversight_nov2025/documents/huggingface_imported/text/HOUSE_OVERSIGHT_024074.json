  "text": "that competition for appropriate investment opportunities may limit significantly the number of\nopportunities available to the Fund and adversely affect the terms upon which investments can\nbe made. There can be no assurance that the Fund will be successful in its efforts to identify\nattractive investment opportunities, and it is possible that the Fund’s Commitments will not be\nfully utilized if sufficient attractive investments are not identified and consummated by the\nFund during the Investment Period.\n\nManagement of the Fund\n\nThe General Partner will make decisions with respect to the management of the Fund. Limited\nPartners have no right or power to take part in the management of the Fund. The Limited\nPartners will not receive the detailed financial information issued by portfolio companies that\nwill be available to the Fund. Accordingly, the Limited Partners will not have the opportunity\nto evaluate the relevant economic, financial and other information that will be utilized by the\nGeneral Partner in its selection of investments. An investor in the Fund must rely upon the\nability of the General Partner with the assistance of the Management Company to identify,\nstructure, and implement investments consistent with the Fund’s investment objectives and\npolicies. Accordingly, no person should purchase Limited Partner Interests unless such person\nis willing to entrust all aspects of the management of the Fund to the General Partner.\n\nReliance on Management of Fund\n\nThe success of the Fund will be largely dependent upon the activities of the Fund Managers.\nThe loss of one or more of these individuals could have a significant adverse impact on the\nbusiness of the Fund and its financial performance.\n\nReliance Upon Portfolio Company Management\n\nAlthough the Fund may seek representation on the board of directors of each of the portfolio\ncompanies or otherwise provide management and strategic planning assistance, the Fund will\nnot have an active role in the day-to-day management of the companies in which it invests. To\nthe extent that the senior management of a portfolio company performs poorly, or if a key\nmanager of a portfolio company terminates employment, the Fund’s investment in such\ncompany could be adversely affected.\n\nPotential Conflicts of Interest\n\nThe Fund Managers will continue to devote a portion of their time to the business of the Sprout\nFunds, NLV-I, NLV-II and to any future funds that they may organize in accordance with the\nPartnership Agreement. Conflicts may arise in the allocation of investment opportunities and\nthe Fund Managers’ time among the Fund and other such partnerships and any such future\nfunds. Prospective investors should be aware that there may be occasions when the General\nPartner, the Fund Managers, the Management Company and their affiliates will encounter\npotential conflicts of interest in connection with the Fund’s activities. The Partnership\nAgreement will contain certain protections for Limited Partners against conflicts of interest\nfaced by the General Partner and its partners, but will not purport to address all types of\nconflicts that may arise. Moreover, as a practical matter, it may be difficult for Limited Partners\nto subject the behavior of the General Partner, the Management Company and their partners to\nclose scrutiny.\n\n63 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024074",
