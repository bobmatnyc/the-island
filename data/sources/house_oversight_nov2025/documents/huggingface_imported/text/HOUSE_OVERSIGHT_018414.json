The whole system gets faster. Such co-evolution is common when\nlinked systems press into one another.?5!\n\nIf you look back at biological history, at our planet’s seething life at it’s most\nprofound moments of transition, you find co-evolution in nearly every case. The\nbiologists John Maynard Smith and Eors Szathmary, in their masterwork The Major\nTransitions in Evolution, chronicle the miraculous march of life towards ever-greater\ncomplexity — from cells to humans to societies - as a story of ceaseless, successful\nco-evolution. “Complexity is hard to define or to measure,” they write. “But there is\nsurely some sense in which elephants and oak trees are more complex than bacteria,\nand bacteria than the first replicating molecules.” The essential, facilitating feature\nof our biological hop-scotch from mitochondrial snot to Beethoven sonatas has been\nan ability to change together, not merely to compete. While we humans tend to\nconsider evolution in murderous you win/I lose Darwinian terms, the biological\nworld around us seethes with a more nuanced logic: Cooperation is every bit as\nimportant to survival.\n\nSmith and Szathmary identified eight major transitions in their work - the evolution\nfrom single cell to multiple cell organisms, for instance. And in each case they find a\nkind of cooperative, co-evolving logic serving a catalyst to survival. “The\napplicability of the concept,” Smith and Szathmary conclude, “extends across the\nwhole of social and natural sciences.” Inside cells. In ecosystem webs of coral or\nrainforest. In traffic management. Successful evolution was, they found, always co-\nevolution. “It should need little persuasion to acknowledge that links we make with\nothers change in time,” they wrote. “That all of us age, that our roles in life evolve,\nand that the society we are a part of may itself be subject to transformations ona\nglobal scale. Coevolutionary rules aim to integrate these processes.” The world\nchanges. I change. You change.\n\nNetwork age systems, in their effortless bridging of divisions - geographical,\ntechnical, commercial - bounce with a particularly powerful fusion. “It is often\nassumed that biological agents are by nature rationally selfish, and that therefore\nexternal circumstances somehow have to compel them to cooperate,” the historians\nNathale Mezza-Garcia, Tom Froese and Nelson Fernadez have written about the\norganization of societies over the past millennia. That sense we often have, that\nwe're one Darwinian instant from some sort of lethal, teeth-baring competition,\ndoesn’t in fact explain all of human history. 253 Politics is a sort of complex adaptive\n\n251 Such co-evolution: Matjaz Perca, Attila Szolnokib, “Coevolutionary games—A\nmini review”, Biosystems 99 (2010) 109-125\n\n253 “It is often assumed”: Nathalie Mezza-Garcia, Tom Froese and Nelson\nFernandez, “Reflections on the Complexity of Ancient Social Heterarchies: Toward\nNew Models of Social Self-Organization in Pre-Hispanic Colombia” in Journal of\nSociocybernetics 12 (2014), pp. 3 - 17\n\n182\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018414",
