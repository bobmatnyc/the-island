  "text": "Emerging market currencies\n\nUBS View See table for current exchange rates and CIO forecasts\ne We continue to like emerging market (EM) currencies over a medium term horizon. We think monetary\npolicies of major central banks will remain loose for longer whereas the easing cycle in several emerging\nmarkets is over. This should support EM currencies relative to major currencies (USD, EUR, and JPY). Long\nterm investors should therefore diversify into EM currencies using surplus exposure to these currencies.\n\n¢ In Europe, both the Polish zloty (PLN) and the Turkish lira (TRY) have supportive fundamentals in the\nlong-term and could benefit from inflows into their fixed-income market which offers attractive yield\nrelative to G4 currencies. Due to structural reasons we remain cautious on the Hungarian forint (HUF).\n\n¢ The South African rand (ZAR) is currently attractively valued, but Investors should be willing and able to\ntolerate bouts of volatility due to the current strikes and a cyclical slowdown of the economy.\n\ne In Asia, we like the Korean won (KRW), the Singaporean dollar (SGD) and the Malaysian ringgit (MYR) as\nall three countries have a strong economy and should benefit from increasing liquidity and a recovering\nChinese economy.\n\n¢ In Latin America, the Mexican peso (MXN) remains attractively valued, despite its recent rally.\n\nA Positive scenario\n¢ Macroeconomic data comes in stronger than expected and contagion risks in Europe subside further. EM\nexchange rates could appreciate swiftly against major currencies (USD, EUR, and JPY).\n\n& Negative scenario\n¢ Global growth prospects suffer a prolonged deterioration and the European debt crisis intensifies. EM\nexchange rates could see a significant, although likely temporary, sell-off across regions.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\n> 5% outperformance of EM FX against G4 currencies over a 6-month horizon\n\n> 5% depreciation of EM FX across regions against USD over a 6-month horizon\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nInflation dynamics\ninEM\n\nInflation dynamics are important to forecast central bank policy rate\ndecisions. Monetary easing typically weighs on EM currencies, while rate hikes\ntend to be supportive. Key policy rate announcement dates: 11 Nov,\nIndonesia; Nov 20, Turkey; Nov 22, South Africa; Nov 30, Mexico\n\nEuropean sovereign crisis Setbacks in sentiment will likely lead to bouts of EM currency depreciation,\n\nproviding attractive entry points for longer term investors.\n\nGrowth Growth in the US, Europe, and China is key for risk sentiment, growth\n\nprospects in EM. Key date: Dec 6, European Central Bank meeting\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne Several EM currencies look attractive at\ncurrent levels and we advise investors to\nkeep existing holdings for further gains\nwhile increasing exposure to our\npreferred EM currencies (KRW, SGD, MYR,\nMXN, TRY, PLN, ZAR), using the JPY, USD,\nand EUR for funding.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne We recommend EM currencies backed by\nstable fundamentals as a strategy to\ndiversify currency exposure.\n\ne Our favorites include the Chilean peso,\nMexican peso, Czech koruna, Polish zloty,\nChinese renminbi, Korean won, Malaysian\nringgit, and Singapore dollar.\n\nUBS CIO EM FX forecasts\n\n24.10.2012 3-month 6-month  12-month\n\nAmericas\n\nUSDBRL 2.02 1.95 1.90 1.85\nUSDMXN 12.9 12.7 12.5 12.3\nAsia\n\nUSDCNY 6.25 6.30 6.30 6.20\nUSDINR 53.6 53.0 54.0 55.0\nUSDIDR 9.615 9,400 9,400 9,400\nUSDKRW 1,103 1,100 1,080 1,050\nUSDSGD 1.22 1.21 1.20 1.19\nEMEA\n\nEURPLN 4.12 4.30 4.15 3.90\nEURHUF 280 290 300 300\nURCZK 24.9 26.0 25.0 24.3\nUSDTRY 1.80 1.75 1.75 1.72\nUSDZAR 8.66 8.20 7.90 7.80\nUSDRUB 31.1 33.0 32.0 31.0\n\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS, as of 15 October 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO's asset class specialists Michael Bolliger, michael.bolliger@ubs.com or Teck Leng Tan, teck-leng.tan@ubs.com 32\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025279",
