  "text": "interest rate hikes by the Fed, and global geopolitical catalysts (e.g. elections, referendums) in 2017 to\ncontribute to a rise in market volatility. These factors should help us to approach our target daily VaR of\n0.80%, and also provide an attractive environment for many of our strategies to generate alpha. While\nhaving more risk on the balance sheet does imply that our return volatility and drawdowns will be larger, it\nis reasonable to expect that any positive returns would increase as well.\n\nManager Attribution:\n\ne For the fourth quarter of 2016, 42% of “Fundamental L/S,” 45% of “Quantitative,” and 67% of\n“Other” managers were profitable.\n\ne The top five performing managers contributed 38% of the quarterly total positive return, with the\nlargest single manager positively contributing 9%. The bottom five performing managers made up\n56% of negative returns, with the largest single manager negatively contributing 17%.\n\n° While 2015 was a stronger year for our strategy overall compared to 2016, we were pleased to see\na continual diversification of return attribution across our managers in 2016. The below statistics\ncompare 2016 with 2015 and present a similar picture of limited return concentration.\n\nPositive Negative\nAttribution Attribution\n2016 | Total 15.94% -7.42%\nTop 5 Contributors 6.48% -2.54%\nLargest Contribution 2.25% -0.67%\n2015 | Total 22.77% -6.92%\nTop 5 Contributors 7.31% -3.55%\nLargest Contribution 1.82% -1.03%\n° As of December 2016, the Multi-Strategy platform had 28 Fundamental L/S Equity managers, 23\n\nQuantitative managers, 10 “Other” managers (these Multi-Strategy platform figures include 9\nHybrid allocations’), and 13 First-Loss managers.\n\nAssets Under Management\n\nAs of January 1, 2017, Boothbay’s total AUM was approximately $190 million ($230 million including\ncapital from First-Loss share class).\n\nAs always, I am available to answer all investment and business inquiries.
