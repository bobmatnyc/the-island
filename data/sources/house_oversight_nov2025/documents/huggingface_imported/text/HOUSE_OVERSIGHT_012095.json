That said, there was quite a bit of turbulence among\nindividual stocks. The Information Technology sector had\na huge month, with the so-called FANG stocks (Facebook,\nAmazon, Netflix, Google) leading the way up, while some\nold economy bellwethers and the much beleaguered brick\nand mortar retailers took a beating. The rising hope of\nU.S. tax reform and the continued strength of the global\neconomic expansion lifted U.S. Treasury yields as well as\ncommodity prices from oil to copper. The U.S. reflation\nexpectation also boosted the greenback. European\nsovereign bond yields and the euro declined after ECB\nPresident Draghi announced a reduction in monthly asset\npurchases starting in 2018, but promised a longer\nduration of QE. China completed its quinquennial\nleadership transition at the conclusion of the 19th Party\nCongress, which should usher in a new era with more\nfocus on the quality of growth over the quantity. President\nXi now awaits President Trump’s State visit to Beijing on\nNovember 84, Investors will likely be focused on issues\nranging from trade to North Korea, though major\nbreakthroughs appear unlikely. Lastly, there is still one\nunresolved sleeper issue that may come back to roil the\nmarket — will a new bipartisan deal be reached in time to\nfund the U.S. government beyond December 8, when the\ncurrent continuing resolution expires?\n\narket Review\n\nJIMMY CHANG, CFA\nChief Investment Strategist\n212-549-5218\njchang@rockco.com\n\nEquity Markets Indices’ 9 ~ ie 7 10/ erica 7 Chose aor\nMSCI All Country World 487 497 2.0% 17.7%\nS&P 500 2519 2575 2.2% 15.0%\nMSCI EAFE 1974 2003 1.5% 18.9%\nRussell 20002 1491 1503 0.8% 10.7%\nNASDAQ 6496 6728 3.6% 25.0%\nTOPIX 1675 1766 5.4% 16.3%\nKOSPI 2394 2523 5.4% 24.5%\nEmerging Markets 1082 1119 3.5% 29.8%\n\nFixed Income\n\n2-Year US Treasury Note 1.49% 1.60% 12 41\n10-Year US Treasury Note 2.33% 2.38% 5 -7\nBarCap US Agg Corp Sprd 1.01% 0.95% -6 -28\nBarCap US Corp HY Sprd 3.47% 3.38% -9 -71\nAustralian (AUD/$) 1.28 1.31 -2.3% 6.3%\nBrazil Real (Real/$) 3.16 m27 -3.3% -0.5%\nBritish Pound ($/GBP) 1.34 1.33 -0.9% 7.6%\nEuro ($/Euro) 1.18 1.16 -1.4% 10.7%\nJapanese Yen (Yen/$) 113 114 -1.0% 2.9%\nKorean Won (KRW/$) 1145 1120 2.2% 7.6%\nUS Dollar Index (DXY) 93.08 94.55 -1.6% 8.1%\n\nCommodities\n\nGold 1280 1271 -0.7% 10.3%\nOil 51.7 54.4 5.2% 1.2%\n\nNatural Gas, Henry Hub 2.89 2.80 -3.0% -24.0%\nCopper (cents/Ib) 296 310 4.9% 23.8%\nCRB Index 183 188 2.4% -2.6%\nBaltic Dry Index 1356 1534 13.1% 59.6%\n\nSOURCE: BLOOMBERG\n\nMONTHLY MARKET REVIEW NOVEMBER 2017 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012095",
