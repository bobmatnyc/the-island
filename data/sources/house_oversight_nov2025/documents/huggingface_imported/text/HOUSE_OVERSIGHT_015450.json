  "text": "audience were straggling out of the theater, | was sitting with Julius in his\ncar in the parking area at Fort Mason Center.\n\nHe was busy rolling a joint in a cigar-box on the dashboard with the\nmap light on. There was a police car circling around in the distance, but we\nunwisely ignored it. Suddenly, a moment later, there was a fist knocking\nheavily on the passenger-side window, and a flashlight shining in my eyes.\nShit! Fuck! Caught!\n\nWe were ordered outside and, with our arms outstretched against\nthe side of the car, with the face of Alfred E. Neuman smiling at the cop\nand asking, “What--me worry?” And indeed, the cop was worried. He\nasked me if | had anything sharp in my pockets.\n\n“Because,” he explained, “I’ m gonna get very mad if | get\nstuck,” obviously referring to a hypodermic needle.\n\n“No,” | said, “there’ s only a pen in this pocket\" --gesturing\ntoward the left with my head-- “and keys in that one.”\n\nHe found the coiled-up three feet of yellow plastic tape warning\n\n“Police Line--Do Not Cross,” and said, “Where'’ d you get this?”\n“At the Saint Stupid Day Parade.”\n“What's it for?”\n\n“To keep people away.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015450",
