  "text": "10 The Virgin Islands Daily News\n\nThe Cuban Scientific Expedition to the\nVirgin Islands in 1951 was documented by\narchaeologists Oswaldo |. Morales Patiho,\nabove, and Fernando Royo Guardia, and\nsubsequently translated and annotated\nmany years later for the Virgin Islands Ar\nchaeological Society in its Journal number\n5 (1978) by Alfredo E. Figueredo. Morales\nPatifio was president of the National Board\nof Archaeology and Ethnology within the\nMinistry of Culture and Education from\n1951-1955. During that same period, Royo\nGuardia served first as secretary and\n\nthen treasurer. The visiting Cuban scien-\ntists were part of a commission formed,\namong other objectives, to study and\nidentify possible routes through which\nprehistoric cultures may have reached\nCuba, to seek evidence of the presence\nof common Cuban influences in Jamaica,\nPuerto Rico and the Virgin Islands, and to\nascertain the spread of Carib influence\nand identify the culture found by Colum-\nbus on St. Croix. Welcomed in the Virgin\nIslands by Gov. Morris de Castro, they\nvisited and examined four sites. On St.\nThomas, they judged the Magens Bay site\nto be Arawakan culture with a few Igneri\nspecimens. Administrator Harry E. Taylor\naccompanied the visitors on St. Croix,\nwhere they viewed three more sites:\nChristiansted environs where they exam-\nined and collected a number of rimsherds\nand shell samples; the Salt River midden,\nwith its French fort earthworks foundation,\nwhere they were able to excavate pottery,\nstone, shell and shell bead specimens;\nand Estate Richmond, where they viewed\nartifacts, including some Igneri pottery,\nobtained by the owners from Salt River\nand from an Indian site on the estate. Ac-\ncording to Figueredo, the “importance of\nthis work (by the Cubans) is not due solely\nto its reports of archaeological remains,\nhowever; it is also a historical document,\noffering us interesting information on the\nstate of affairs, beliefs, and personalities\nof its time. The Cubans came during one\nof our minor dark ages — when archaeo-\nlogical work had come to a near standstill,\nand the history and historiography of the\n(Virgin Islands) ... were in abject abandon.”\n\nKatheryne Brooks Kay-Willock, archaeologist with the Conservation and\nCultural Affairs Department, studies the remains of what is believed to be\n1,000-yearold skeleton located at Hull Bay beach in 1974 in St. Thomas,\nat a proposed condominium project.\n\nTuesday, December 13, 2016\n\nVirgin Islands\nlaborers excavate\npre-historic deposits\nat Magens Bay, St.\nThomas.\n\nPhoto courtesy of\nTHE VIRGIN ISLANDS,\nOUR NEW POSSESSIONS\n\nThe “ribbon-sealed” bottle, a PF\nHeering Company “Heering's\nCherry Cordial” bottle produced\nin the period 1835-1850, was\nrecovered from the harbor in\nSt. Thomas, where many such\nitems have been discarded over\nthe centuries. The Schenectady\n(New York) Gazette of Jan. 7,\n1981, reported an upcoming\nlecture presentation to the Na-\ntional Bottle Museum Society in\nBallston Spa, N.Y., on the “Bur\nied Treasures of St. Thomas.”\nThe newspaper reported that\nlecturer Gary T. Stephenson “re-\ncently returned from the Virgin\nIslands where he provided con-\nsulting services to an individual\nwho has unearthed over 3,000\nbottles from an old community\ndump. The collection dates\nback to 1700. ‘| have never\nseen so many bottles come out\nof one dig, said Stephenson,\nvice president of the museum\nsociety. Bottles in the collection\ncome from Paris, London, Mar\ntinique, Canada, Germany and\nthe U.S.A. They graphically illus-\ntrate the history of St. Thomas,\nshowing evidence of worldwide\ntrade and commerce. The St.\nThomas collection is considered\nto be the fifth largest collection\n\nin the U.S’\nPhoto courtesy of\nVAGN PETERSEN'S DANISH BOTTLES\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014507",
