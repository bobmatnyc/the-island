And I couldn’t help feeling the role was intended as a kind of rest-\nand-recovery cure because of my illness, not too different from the reason Uzi\nhad been given the job. Still, I did need rest and recovery. Even if fully healthy,\nI’m not sure I could have convinced Motta to change his mind. In my weakened\nstate, I had no chance.\n\nSkeptical though I was about the job, it opened up a new world to me. The\nkirya itself was not new territory. But now, I became exposed to how how the\nhuge range of intelligence information we gathered was collated, evaluated,\nassessed and ultimately applied. Helping with this process was my new\nassignment. There were, in fact, two of us. We were both colonels and together\nwe provided the intelligence background for military operations. I had the post\non inside the military intelligence department. My opposite number was in the\noperations department — the more senior role, in a way, because he had a more\ndirect link to the people actually doing the operations. He was a friend from\nofficers’ school: Dovik Tamari’s younger brother, Shai. Once a week, Shai and\nI put together an assessment report. Then, we’d join Motta’s operations meeting\nwith the general staff, often attended by the man who’d followed Dayan as\ndefense minister, Shimon Peres.\n\nThe analysis of military intelligence included separate teams for Egypt and\nSyria, Jordan and Lebanon, Iraq and other neighboring states, as well as other\ncountries and superpower relations. It relied on all our raw intelligence material,\nfrom both military intelligence and Mossad, as well as academic and specialist\nliterature. Each desk dealt not just with military issues, but political and\neconomic developments. I was responsible, along with Shai and a few others,\nfor bringing all this together. This meant frequent meetings with members of the\nanalysis teams. For the first six months or so, I barely uttered a word in these\nsessions. I listened, not just absorbing the information but getting to understand\nthe way the analysts worked and thought.\n\nOur whole intelligence department was responsible for drafting an annual\nstrategic assessment for the army and the government. The final report was\nwritten by Shlomo Gazit, who had succeeded Eli Zeira as head of military\nintelligence. Before we sent it to print, he held a long meeting, inviting the\nviews of all the military intelligence officers. The focus in 1976, just three years\nafter the war, was on the risks of a new surprise attack. At the end of the\ndiscussion, however, he said: ““We know we run a real danger for the country if\n\n163\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028011",
