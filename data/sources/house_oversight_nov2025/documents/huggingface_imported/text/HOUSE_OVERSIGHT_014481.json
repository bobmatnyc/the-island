  "text": "recent price action for individual assets. However, the fact that we have had multiple\nsignals across a range of sectors and macro prices is typically a warning that markets\nhave moved too far too fast in a more general sense.\n\nThe last comparable episode was in early July in the wake of the Brexit sell-off. At that\npoint Defensives were hitting record over bought signals with Financials and Cyclicals\nseeing the opposite. Against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty over the effects of\nBrexit the models provided a great signal to fade the violent rotation.\n\nWith these signals in mind we look for a period of consolidation in the rotation trade.\nThe models are short term in nature and are not intended to identify strategic turning\npoints — although like in the case of Brexit they do tend to emphasize when a crescendo\nis reached. While we would look for another potential leg in some of the reflation trades\nover the coming months we would prefer to wait for a pull back. The Basic Resources\nsector provides a useful example in how to use the models tactically. Three times this\nyear prior to the current instance the sector has hit overbought levels on its relative CT|\nindicator. Previous pullbacks lasted 4-8 weeks and averaged -11% in relative\nperformance terms.\n\nTable 5: Composite Technical Indicators for sector relative returns\n(+100 max overbought; -100 max oversold}\n\nTable 6: Bollinger scores —bond proxies 2.5-3.5SD oversold\n\n52-week Z-Score\n\nSince Oct 27 Recent 1m extreme Latest\n[Sector Latest MIN MAX Utiity 38 26\nHealthcare a -98 ‘| Real Estate 34 -2.1\nPersonal & Household Goods 0 -94 0 Media 29 18\nFood & Beverages -31 -93 0 Food & Bev 26 22\nTelecom 2 92 0 HealthCare -25 -18\nUtilities 8 -92 3 Telcos 2A 99\nTechnology 0 se 26 Travel & Leis 21 07\nMedia “| 87 7 Retail 15 0.4\nIndustrial Goods & Services 0 -13 35 Prs & HH Gds 42 06\nOil & Gas { AS 4 Autos 0.8 05\nAutos 0 “12 8 Insurance 0.9 08\nChemicals 0 8 0 Technology 1.0 06\nTravel & Leisure 0 -27 37 Banks 10 06\nFinancial Services -| 3 43 FinServ 10 06\nConstruction & Materials 0 -17 45 Industrials 15 14\nRetail 0 -42 90 Oils 16 09\nInsurance 36 0 94 Chemicals 19 08\nBanks 16 8 94 Construction 2.0 12\nBasic Resources 9 7 100 Basics 27 22\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nChart 45: Basic Resources 4\" overbought signal this year — previous\npullbacks last 4-8 weeks and averaged -11% relative\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nChart 46: Utilities near a record -4SD oversold vs 52-week average\n\n100\n80\n60\n40\n\n1.2\n\n1.1\n\n1.0\n\n; 0.9\n\n} ==——=CTl relative —=———=Basics relative\n\n12/15 0216 O46 0616 08/16 10/16\n\n0.8\n\n0.7\n\n0.6\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\n5.0\n4.0\n3.0\n2.0\n1.0\n0.0\n-1.0\n-2.0\n-3.0\n\n-4.0\nDec-97 Dec-01 Dec-05 Dec-09 Dec-13\n\nUtility - relative price vs 52wk average (SD)\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\n; Bankof America\n22 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014481",
