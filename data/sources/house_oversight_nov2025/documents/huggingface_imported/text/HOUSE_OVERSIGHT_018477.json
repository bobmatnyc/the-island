  "text": "to sleep. I can either take care of that in the bathroom, or I can do it here. If I do it here,\nthen you can help me along, or not. I'd especially appreciate it if you could talk dirty\nwhile I jerk off, but it's your decision.”\n\nTalk about low pressure! Yeah, I learned a lot from that guy.\n\nKK ok\n\n2) Scripts and Lists. I had one brief relationship last year with a gentleman who is really,\nreally awesome -- but we have very different approaches to S&M. We had a hard time\ncommunicating about it... honestly, if he hadn't been such an awesome guy, I would\nprobably have given up on the relationship after a couple nights together. We were great\nat having extensive theoretical conversations about sexuality, but when it came down to\nactually having sex with each other, things got puzzling. We had difficulty predicting,\nunderstanding, and initiating with each other.\n\nI'm not sure what made it so hard. I think, mostly, we just brought really different\nassumptions to the table. I tend to take an \"improvisational\" approach to my encounters,\nwhereas he tends to take a \"scripted\" approach. He's into doing stuff like rearranging the\nfurniture, taking on specific roles (e.g. teacher and student), using costumes and props,\nand knowing exactly what will be said beforehand.\n\nMe, I like going free-form. I talk to my partner about hard limits (things we absolutely\ndon't want to do); I talk to him about things we really like; and we set a safeword. I'm\nusually okay with diving in from there. If he wants a more structured conversation, I'm\nglad to have one (and sometimes, especially when I'm dominant, I'll ask for more\nconversation myself). But generally, I like seeing how things go based on a very loose set\nof guidelines, and making minor adjustments during the encounter, then evaluating the\nsituation afterwards.\n\nOne of the reasons I like doing this is that unexpected things happen. On the flip side,\nthere's also more room for experiences that aren't very exciting. I think I'm more likely to\nhave disjointed or confusing encounters than a lot of other BDSMers I know, although\nmaybe I'm just falling prey to the bias of assuming other people are doing better than I\nam. And Scripty Guy in particular really doesn't like disjoint and confusion -- he likes\nknowing what's going to happen.\n\nLate in the relationship, I suggested that we try going through a checklist. When people\nuse these checklists, a lot of the time they just write their rating for each act, and give\nthem to each other to read. What we did instead was go through the checklist together\nand discuss what we found hot, what was not, and whatever else came to mind.\n\nThis worked amazingly well -- it totally bridged our theoretical gap and it was a turn-on\nin itself! (Seriously, by the time we were done going through the whole list, I could not\nwait to have sex with that guy.) The conversation also helped me figure out the scripted\nvs. un-scripted difference between us.\n\nWe stopped seeing each other for unrelated reasons soon afterwards, and they were good\nreasons, but it seemed like a shame; I felt like we'd only just started figuring things out.\nI'm not sure how well our S&M styles would have ultimately meshed, but I was curious\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018477",
