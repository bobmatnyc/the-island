  "text": "the (currently) esoteric domain of self-reproducing machines—to the power and\nversatility of neurons and their synapses. This could become a new, great frontier of\nresearch. Here too, biology might point the way, as we come to understand biological\ndevelopment well enough to imitate its essence.\n\nAltogether, the advantages of artificial over natural intelligence appear\npermanent, while the advantages of natural over artificial intelligence, though substantial\nat present, appear transient. I’d guess that it will be many decades before engineering\ncatches up, but—barring catastrophic wars, climate change, or plagues, so that\ntechnological progress stays vigorous—few centuries.\n\nIf that’s right, we can look forward to several generations during which humans,\nempowered and augmented by smart devices, coexist with increasingly capable\nautonomous Als. There will be a complex, rapidly changing ecology of intelligence, and\nrapid evolution in consequence. Given the intrinsic advantages that engineered devices\nwill eventually offer, the vanguard of that evolution will be cyborgs and superminds,\nrather than lightly adorned Homo sapiens.\n\nAnother important impetus will come from the exploration of hostile\nenvironments, both on Earth (e.g., the deep ocean) and, especially, in space. The human\nbody is poorly adapted to conditions outside a narrow band of temperatures, pressures,\nand atmospheric composition. It needs a wide variety of specific, complex nutrients, and\nplenty of water. Also, it is not radiation-hardened. As the manned space program has\namply demonstrated, it is difficult and expensive to maintain humans outside their\nterrestrial comfort zone. Cyborgs or autonomous AIs could be much more effective in\nthese explorations. Quantum Als, with their sensitivity to noise, might even be happier in\nthe cold and dark of deep space.\n\nIn a moving passage from his 1935 novel Odd John, science fiction’s singular\ngenius Olaf Stapledon has his hero, a superhuman (mutant) intelligence, describe Homo\nsapiens as “the Archaeopteryx of the spirit.” He says this, fondly, to his friend and\nbiographer, who is a normal human. Archaeopteryx was a noble creature, and a bridge to\ngreater ones.\n\n61\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016864",
