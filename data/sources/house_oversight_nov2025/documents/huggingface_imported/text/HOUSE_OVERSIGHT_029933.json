Still others note the way\nthe Israeli authorities portray the organizers as violent Islamists when\nmost are middle-aged European pacifists.\n\nAlmost everything about the flotilla stuck in Greece and waiting to\nchallenge Israel’s blockade of Gaza seems to be a parable for\nsomething else, part of an unstated effort to recast the Israeli-\nPalestinian narrative in extreme terms. Instead of helping to clarify\nwhat Gaza needs and how it might build a future, the saga has merely\nbrought out the public relations demons on all sides.\n\nOstensibly the 10 or so boats, with several hundred advocates from\nmore than a dozen countries, are trying to take goods to Gaza because\nof a siege imposed by Israel and Egypt to pressure Hamas, the\nIslamist ruler there. A year ago a similar flotilla was stopped by the\nIsraeli Navy, and after commandos boarded and scuffles ensued, nine\nactivists were killed.\n\nThe international outrage that followed helped force an easing of the\nsiege. One result, largely unacknowledged by the flotilla leaders: far\nmore goods have gone into Gaza over the past year, and while the 1.6\nmillion people there still need many things, basic supplies are not\namong them.\n\nIsrael is therefore quick to say that Gaza is well provided for and does\nnot need any flotilla. [fit still wants to bring in aid, it should take it\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029933",
