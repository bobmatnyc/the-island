after DJT actually signs it. I'll point out the location of the other eggs much more creative - overall though,
the writers were very sophisticated. they closed many many loopholes. and did it elegantly. example closing
all the 1031 crazy transactions by merely inserting the word " real" in from of the word property very

clever, or not redoing the paragraph but merely changing the penalty to zero. . or detailing related party
definitions that had teeth. . they cant be faulted for not getting it right -100 percent :)
