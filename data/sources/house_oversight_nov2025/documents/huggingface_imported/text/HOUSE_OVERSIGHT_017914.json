Republic of South Africa, 300 F.3d 230, 241\n(2d Cir.2002) (quoting Cargill Int'l SLA. v. M/T PAVEL\nDYBENKO, 991 F.2d 1012, 1016 (2d Cir.1993)). “Then,\nthe plaintiff ‘has the burden of going forward with\nevidence showing that, under the exceptions to the FSIA,\nimmunity should not be granted.’ ” Virtual Countries, 300\nF.3d at 241 (quoting Cargill, 991 F.2d at 1016); see also\nTerrorist Attacks [, 349 F.Supp.2d at 792-797 (explaining\nthat the possibly relevant exceptions to immunity in this\nlitigation include the commercial activities, torts, and\nstate sponsor of terrorism exceptions). Determining\nwhether this burden is met involves a ‘review [of] the\nallegations in the complaint, the undisputed facts, if any,\nplaced before [the court] by the parties, and—if the\nplaintiff comes forward with sufficient evidence to carry\nits burden of production on this issue—[resolution of]\ndisputed issues of fact.’ ” Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at\n241 (quoting Robinson, 269 F.3d at 141). Throughout the\ninquiry, Defendants retain the burden of persuasion,\nwhich they must meet by a preponderance of the\nevidence. Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at 241; see also\nRobinson, 269 F.3d at 141 n. 8.\n\nA. Allegations Against Defendants Asserting\nForeign Sovereign Immunity\n\n1. Saudi High Commission‘\n\nIn 1993, then-King Fahad bin Abdulaziz Al—-Saud, the\nPresident of the Council of *548 Ministers of Saudi\nArabia, decreed the formation of SHC, also known as the\nSaudi High Relief Commission, by High Order 17419.\n(Ashton Compl. J 446; Burnett Compl. J 392; Federal\nCompl. § 180; see also SHC Mem. in Sup. Mot. to\nDismiss at 3.) The same High Order named Defendant\nPrince Salman the President of SHC. (Ashton Compl. J\n446; Burnett Compl. J 392; SHC Mem. in Sup. Mot. to\nDismiss at 3.)\n\nSHC allegedly has contributed $600 million to aid\n“Bosnian Muslims impoverished by the country’s recent\ncivil war.” (Ashton Compl. J 446; Burnett Compl. J 392.)\nPlaintiffs claim, however, that SHC does not provide\nsupport to the needy but actually diverts funds for terrorist\nactivities. (Ashton Compl. 7 454; Burnett Compl. § 404.)\nIn support, Plaintiffs allege that Prince Salman received a\nletter in September 2000 from a Bosnian association\nclaiming SHC did not provide charitable assistance, and\nthat none of the money collected after the fall of\nSrebrenica in July 1995 actually reached the Srebrenican\npeople. (Ashton Compl. J§ 454-55; Burnett Com pl. TF\n404-05; Federal Compl. JJ 185, 457.) Plaintiffs claim\n\nWESTLAW\n\nSHC’s financial records fail to account for $41 million.\n(Ashton Compl. J 456; Burnett Compl. § 407; Federal\nCompl. J 460.) SHC allegedly made donations to charity\nDefendant Taibah and the bin Laden Establishment.\n(Ashton Compl. JJ 376, 462 (relying on 1995 bin Laden\ninterview); Burnett Compl. J 298.) Plaintiffs also claim\nthat SHC is responsible for “importing the extreme form\nof Saudi Islam, Wahhabism” to Bosnia. (Ashton Compl. J\n447; Burnett Compl. § 393.)\n\nThe Federal Plaintiffs allege that al Qaeda fighters began\nentering Bosnia—Herzegovina in 1992 disguised as SHC\nrelief workers. (Federal Compl. J 183.) On October 21,\n2001, a group of Algerians who were supposedly part of\nthe al Qaeda network were arrested in Bosnia\nHerzegovina on charges of terrorism directed at the\nUnited States embassy. (Ashton Compl. Jf 448-49;\nBurnett Compl. J§ 394-95.) One of the arrested, Sabir\nLamar, apparently worked for SHC as an Arabic language\nteacher. (Ashton Compl. J 450; Burnett Compl. J 396.)\nAlso in October 2001, Plaintiffs claim that United States\nforces raided the Sarajevo branch of SHC and “found\ncomputer hard drives with photographs of the World\nTrade Center before and after its collapse as well as\nphotos of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania\nand the U.S.S. Cole.” (Ashton Compl. J 451; Burnett\nCompl. J 397; Federal Compl. J § 186, 458.) The U.S.\nforces also apparently found files on pesticides and crop\ndusters, the locations of Washington government\nbuildings, fake State Department badges, and cash.\n(Ashton Compl. Ff 451, 453; Burnett Compl. FF 397, 399;\nFederal Compl. §§ 186, 459.) After the raid, the Financial\nPolice of the Federation of Bosnia Herzegovina Ministry\nof Finance analyzed the seized documents and stated that\nsome did “not belong in the scope of work of a\nhumanitarian organization.” (Federal Compl. Ff 187, 459;\nsee also Ashton Compl. § 452; Burnett Compl. J 398.)\nThe Federal Plaintiffs claim that the SHC “has long acted\nas a fully integrated component of al Qaida’s logistical\nand financial support infrastructure ... [and that the attacks\nof September 11 were] a direct, intended and foreseeable\nproduct of [its] participation in al Qaida’s jihadist\ncampaign.” (Federal Compl. Jf 182, 189.)\n\n*549 2. Prince Salman’\nPrince Salman is a member of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia’s Council of Ministers, the governor of the\nprovince of Riyadh, and the President of Defendant SHC.\n(Prince Salman Mem. in Sup. Mot. to Dismiss at 2.)\nPlaintiffs allege that Prince Salman provided material\nsupport to Osama bin Laden and al Qaeda. (Ashton\nCompl.
