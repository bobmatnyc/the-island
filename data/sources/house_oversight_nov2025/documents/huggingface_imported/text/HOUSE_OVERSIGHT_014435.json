  "text": "X Asset Strategy: Long growth, short bonds, long USD but\nthe hunt for yield lives on\n\nClearly markets are different and will continue to be so under President elect Trump\nBUT not everything will change. The disinflationary forces triggered by the GFC have\nnot gone away but the decision to focus on fiscal stimulus, not just in the US but also\nJapan and to a lesser extent the UK, is a welcome shift taking some of the burden away\nfrom monetary policy. It means rates should be higher for any given amount of growth.\nBut higher does not mean a return to pre GFC levels of rates, which we need to bear in\nmind when setting our strategy. Indeed, our strategists 10Y forecasts are US 2.65%,\nEuro 0.65% and Japan 0% for end 2017.\n\nSimilarly on trade, for all the rhetoric of the President-elect again we do not think he\nwants to trigger trade wars that would damage US growth. That means we should not\nnecessarily drop our pro-EM bias.\n\nSo we think of it as an evolution rather than a revolution in the way our strategy is\nstructured. We wanted to be exposed to growth, we tweak that by adding a NKY long to\nreplace our US energy long. We continue to have yield in the portfolio where we can find\nit, which is through a mixture of equities and credit (AT1’s, European yield basket, Xover\nv Main and US long date industrial spreads).\n\nEven more than before we want to be protected against a stronger USD and higher\nrates, hence the addition of the 10Y real yield trade, and trade tensions which we have\ntried to cover through our CNH put.\n\nNov 8\" accelerates some trends, starts other\n\nBefore the US election we said that the tectonic plates were starting to shift, with bond\nyields having troughed and starting to head higher. We thought there were signs too\nthat global growth might be shifting up a gear. So we wanted to have defensive\npositions in bond markets, be long the USD and be long growth where we could. The\nelection of Donald Trump has arguably turned this gradual shifting of plates into a full\nblown earthquake for global financial markets.\n\nThe key questions for investors as we look ahead to 2017 are how big an earthquake\nand how much the moves that have happened since November 8\" are likely to be\nextended into next year vs how much we have frontloaded them already in 2016.\n\nChart 1: USD/JPY has surged post-Trump Chart 2: As have bond yields\n125 2.9\n120 2.3\n—= JPY/USD —— 10y UST yield\n115 2.1\n110 1.9\n105 1.7\n100 1.5\n95 1.3\nike} iw Ww oO io] ico} ico} ico} ico} ico} ie) co co ike} Ww Ke} ico} ico} ico} ico} ico} ico} ico} ico} ico} ico}\nSSR ERE EERE ES SSR eRe EER EES\nSource: Bloomberg Source: Bloomberg\n4 Global Cross Asset Strategy - Year Ahead | 30 November 2016 Bankof America 2\n\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014435",
