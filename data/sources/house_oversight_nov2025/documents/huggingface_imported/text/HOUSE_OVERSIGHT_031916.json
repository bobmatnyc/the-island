  "text": "4\n\nObama will have to make some decisions. But it’s far better to let the\nSyrians do this themselves, if they can. We cannot prevent every\ncasualty. That’s starting to sound like a doctrine to me. Call it the\ndoctrine of no doctrine: using our power and influence but doing so\nprudently and multilaterally, with the crucial recognition that Egypt is\ndifferent from Libya is different from Syria is different from\nsomeplace else. According to the foreign-policy establishment, if you\nwant to have a self-respecting big-D doctrine, you’re not supposed to\nrecognize differences. The doctrine must guide all cases. But that is\nexactly the kind of thinking that has led—always—to tragedy. The\nTruman Doctrine was never meant to be applied to Vietnam. The\nBush Doctrine was applied to Iraq based on a series of lies told to the\nAmerican people. And so on. If the Obama Doctrine is nothing like\nthose, so much the better. This does not yet greatness make. These\ndramatic changes have to work out for the better, and here the United\nStates has a huge role to play. With respect to Libya, for example, we\nhave control of about $37 billion in assets we can dole out to the\ntransitional council. And yes, we probably are interested in its oil.\nBut that doesn’t have to mean stealing it. All the Western countries\nthat backed the rebels have to play a constructive and non- (forgive\nme for such a dated word) imperialist role in helping the country\nbuild its future. So there’s work to be done. But it’s hardly\nimpossible to envision an Obama administration in a few years’ time\nthat has drawn down Afghanistan and Iraq, helped foster reforms and\nmaybe even the growth of a couple of democracies around the Middle\nEast, and restored the standing of a country that Bush had laid such\nstaggering waste. And killed Osama bin Laden. If this is weak\nAmerica-hating, count me in.\n\nNewsweek/Daily Beast special correspondent Michael Tomasky is\nalso editor of Democracy: A Journal of Ideas.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031916",
