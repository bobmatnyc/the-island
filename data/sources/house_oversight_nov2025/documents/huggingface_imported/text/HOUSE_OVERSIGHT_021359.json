  "text": "Christian disciples. This God is both\nintensely human and intensely\nsupernatural. In these churches, God is\nunderstood as so person-like that he\nbecomes someone to joke and argue\nwith, someone one chats to when\nwalking down the street, about the little\ntrivial things that matter only to the\ncongregant. Coming to know God in\nsuch a church is described as to hear\nGod “speak.” Dallas Willard, a beloved\nevangelical’s intellectual, puts it baldly:\nthat God’s face-to-face conversations\nwith Moses are the “normal human life\nGod intended for us.” I conducted\nethnographic fieldwork at a church that\nexemplifies this approach to God, a\nVineyard Christian Fellowship in\nChicago and then on the San Francisco\npeninsula (there were eight such\nchurches in Chicago and four on the\npeninsula). For three years I went to\nSunday morning gatherings. I joined\nthree small groups, or housegroups, each\nfor a year; I went to conferences and\nretreats; and I interviewed many\ncongregants casually and also more\nformally about the way they experienced\nGod.\n\nOverall, what I observed was that\nthe process of coming to know God in\nsuch a church could best be described as\na mapping process in which the\ncongregants learn to use the familiar\nexperience of their own minds and\nbodies to give content to the abstract\nexperience of God. This is the way that\nhumans learn most commonplace\nabstract words, in effect cognitively\nmapping from what we know to what we\ncan only imagine. God speaks: so\ncongregants learn to infer from their own\nexperience of inner speech the way in\nwhich God talks to them. God relates: so\ncongregants learn to imagine a\nrelationship with God based on their\n\n113\n\nPage\n\nown experience of relationship. And\nGod loves: and congregants use their\nown experience of being loved by a\nhuman as an example of the way they\nare loved by God. But unlike learning\nabout time, congregants also map back.\nThey build up a model of God by\ninterpreting out of their own familiar\nexperience into a representation shaped\nby the social world of the church and the\nnarrative of the sacred text, and then\nthey seek to re-map their own interior\nemotional experience by matching it to\nthis representation. This demands\nconstant effort, continual work on the\nway one pays attention and interprets\none’s experience. As an ethnographer, I\ncould see three kinds of work.\n\nFirst, God must be recognized as\npresent. What congregants learn to do is\nto cherry-pick mental events out of the\neveryday flow of their awareness, and to\nidentify that moment as other than\nthemselves, as being of God. God was\nsaid to speak in several different ways.\nHe spoke through the Bible, so that a\nverse “jumped out” at a congregant, or in\nsome way drew their attention. For\nexample:\n\n“T was reading in [some book] and I\ndon’t even know why I was reading it.\nThere’s a part where God talks about\nraising up elders in the church to pray\nfor the church. And I remember, it just\nstuck in my head and I knew that the\nverse was really important and that it\nwas applicable to me. I didn’t know\nwhy. It was one of those, let me put it in\nmy pocket and figure it out later.” How\ndid she know that it was important?\n“Because I just felt it. I just felt like it\nreally spoke to me. I don’t really know\nwhy. And a couple of days later a friend\nasked me to be on the prayer team and it\nwas like, wow, that’s what it was.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021359",
