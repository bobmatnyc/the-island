I saw Spicer and Priebus his week. I'd pretty much say that \nnearly 100% of the non-family senior staff of the first six months now believe that Trump can't function in this \njob. I think they all become part of a Republican initiative to take him down. I hear Kelly trying to make Trump \nunderstand that Jared and Ivanka have to go. \nOn Fri, Aug 18, 2017 at 3:58 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nI assume no dinner \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
