  "text": "NAUTIL.US\n\nOxygen: Your leafy breath\n\nThe oxygen in your lungs and bloodstream 1s a highly\nreactive waste product generated by vegetation and\nmicrobes. Trees, herbs, algae, and blue-green bacte-\nria split oxygen atoms out of water molecules during\nphotosynthesis. They use most of the resultant gas for\ntheir own purposes, but thankfully some leaks out to\nsustain you. In fact it makes up about a fifth of the\nair you breathe. Your cells harness oxygen to release\nenergy from chemical bonds 1n the food you consume.\n\nTEXT SETS\n\nOxygen absorbs electrons released by broken food\nmolecules, which attract hydrogen ions, resulting in\na molecular waste of your own making: metabolic\nwater, which comprises one tenth of your body fluids.\nAn average adult carries between 8 and 10 pounds of\nhomemade wastewater within them, and 1 in 10 of your\ntears are the metabolic by-products of your breathing\nand eating.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015479",
