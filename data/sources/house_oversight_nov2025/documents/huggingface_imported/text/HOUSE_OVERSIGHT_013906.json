  "text": "can mention my name with PR Leads to get two months for the price of one.\n\n»PRWeb Press Releases (www.prwebdirect.com) The press release is dead for most purposes, but\nusing this service has some serious search-engine benefits, such as appearing at the top of related Google\nNews and Yahoo! News results.\n\n=» ExpertClick ( www.expertclick.com )\n\nThis is another secret of the PR pros. Put up an expert profile for media to see, receive an up-to-date\ndatabase of top media contacts, and send free press releases to 12,000 journalists, all on one website that\ngets more than 5 million hits per month. This is how I got on NBC and ended up developing a prime-\ntime TV show. It works. Mention my name on the phone, or use “Tim Ferriss $100” online, to get a\n$100 discount.\n\n» LIFESTYLE DESIGN IN ACTION\n\nBon Jour Tim,\n\nI was in Barnes & Noble at the help desk this past Saturday, April 25, waiting for an employee to get a\nbook for me (Tropic of Cancer if you must know). While I was waiting, I noticed a copy of 4-Hour\nWorkweek on the counter that someone else had ordered. Not one to be shy, I reached over the counter\nand started reading their copy. As you might guess, I had the employee go back and get me my own\ncopy. Haven’t finished Tropic of Cancer but finished your book ...\n\n... On Monday I got a yes when I asked my boss to work two days remotely per week. I start next\nweek.\n\nOn Monday I also booked the most stunning apartment in Paris for the month of September, at a cost\nof half of the rent I pay in Southern California. I plan to increase my remote time now through August so\nthat September will be an easy ask to leave for remote work. If the answer happens to be no (which I\nnow doubt), I will be prepared to quit my job.\n\nNow at work on my Income Autopilot project.\n\nTim: amazing. My life has changed in three days. (Plus, your book was funny as hell.) Thank\nyou!!! —CINDY FRANKEY\n\n21. There are a few limited exceptions, such as online membership sites that don’t require content\ngeneration, but as a general rule, products require much less maintenance and will get you to your\nTMI faster.\n\n22. Muses will provide the time and financial freedom to realize your dreamlines in record time, after\nwhich one can (and often does) start additional companies to change the world or sell.\n\n23. Distributors are sometimes also referred to as “wholesalers,” depending on the industry.\n\n24. It is illegal to control how much someone sells your product for, but you can dictate how much\nthey advertise it for. This is done by including a Minimum Advertised Pricing (MAP) policy in your\nGeneral Terms and Conditions (GTC), which are agreed to automatically when a written wholesale\norder is placed. Sample GTC and order forms are available at www.fourhourblog.com.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013906",
