  "text": "jargon by accident. Also, plenty of S&M terms are super useful, and giving a quick\noverview of S&M language can go a long way towards describing S&M culture. Hence, I\nhave included a Glossary at the end of this book. Many of the terms in the Glossary aren't\nterms that I use in this book, but you might find it useful or interesting anyway. (I also\nincluded a few terms that come from other subcultures, such as polyamory or queer\nstudies.)\n\nI've received a lot of feedback over the years informing me that I'm the \"gateway drug”\ninto feminism for some readers. That's kind of cool, but I want to make it clear that if\nyou're just now getting into feminism, there's lots of other stuff to learn before you draw\nany conclusions. Feminism is a huge, varied, rich movement with lots of history, schisms,\nand discontents. Also, in case it needs to be said, I'm not the only feminist who does\nS&M. There are others, some of whom love my work and some of whom disagree with\nme frequently.\n\nOne advantage of the blog format, as opposed to more traditional formats, is that each\npost can contain tons of hyperlinks -- and each article has comment space, so there can be\nfascinating discussions that explore each topic more deeply. (Of course, there can also be\nsilly, boring, or offensive discussions.) As soon as a blog becomes moderately successful,\nit develops its own community of regular commenters, and mine is no exception.\nFacilitating and moderating these discussions can be amazingly fun and interesting. It can\nalso be stressful and exhausting. As a commenter community evolves, it shapes how\nother people read the blog's articles and comment on them; sometimes the community\nwill develop norms or tendencies that make certain people feel more comfortable -- or\nless comfortable. I've tried to control this with my blog so that it's a welcoming\nenvironment for most people, but I have such a diverse range of commenters that it's\nsometimes quite difficult.\n\nI bring all this up because, if you're intrigued by some of the articles you read in this\nbook, I encourage you to check out the original post. In this book, I've made a lot of\nhyperlinks into footnotes, but not all of them. More importantly, if you look at the\noriginal post, you can read the comments. But my commenter community has changed\nover time. Sometimes it's more feminist, for example, and sometimes it's less feminist. So\njust be aware, if you read the comments, that the range of opinions may not reflect any\ngroup that would assemble elsewhere on the planet; that a different community might\nproduce really different comments; and that other articles might have really different\ndiscussions.\n\nYou can buy this book in paperback form at CreateSpace:\n\nhttps://www.createspace.com/3878670\n\nIf you've already read my incredibly awesome book Confessions of a Pickup Artist\nChaser, then thank you! (Bonus points if you can pick out all the parts of Confessions\nthat I pulled verbatim from articles included in this book.) If you haven't read\nConfessions, then please check that out, too.\n\nhttps://www.smashwords.com/books/view/14445 1\nPaperback copies of Confessions: https://www.createspace.com/3830583\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018441",
