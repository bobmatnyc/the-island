  "text": "wants to focus on the Asia-Pacific region and, surprisingly, it means what\nit says.\n\nOnly a year after troops withdrew from Iraq, that country is not talked\nabout in Washington, like an embarrassing relative. In North Africa, the\nUS military has taken a back seat while the work of toppling Colonel\nMuammar Qaddafi and driving back the jihadists in Mali has been left to\nFranco-British forces. Syrian policy is one of drift, where the\nadministration finds all options unpalatable. In Egypt, Washington has set\na red line for the Muslim Brotherhood leadership: it must adhere to the\npeace treaty with Israel. Everything else is negotiable.\n\nThis week the Pentagon revealed that it would no longer be stationing two\naircraft carriers in the Gulf region, as it has done for most of the past two\nyears, due to cuts in the defence budget, and the possibility of even more\nstringent ones if Congress fails to agree on raising the US debt ceiling.\n\nThe Iranian nuclear programme remains a priority in Washington, but the\ncarrier decision indicates a less warlike stance. One cannot say that US\npower is ebbing, but there is a clear lack of political will in Washington\nfor decisive action in the Middle East. For now, the logic is that regional\npowers will have to take more responsibility. Egypt, although impotent at\nthe moment, will have to find its role. The US needs to talk to Iran if there\nis ever going to be a compromise on its nuclear programme. Maybe Egypt\ncould help.\n\nBoth Egypt and Iran have denied a report that General Qassem Suleimani,\ncommander of the Quds force, a division of the Iranian Islamic\nRevolutionary Guard Corps, and the man responsible for Iran's military\noperations in Syria, visited Cairo in January. There was no reaction in\nWashington to this report.\n\nIf there is going to be a resolution of the Syrian crisis without a decade of\nLebanon-style war, then allies of the US will have to speak to someone of\nthe calibre of Gen Suleimani, a far more important figure than Mr\nAhmadinejad. Could this lead to a historic compromise between the\nMuslim Brotherhood and the ayatollahs to create a new Islamic front\nspreading revolution?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028736",
