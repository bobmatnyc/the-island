  "text": "Removing Yourself from the Equation: When and How\n\nThe system is the solution.\n\n— AT&T\n\nTre diagram should be your rough blueprint for designing a self-sustaining virtual architecture. There\n\ncould be differences—more or fewer elements—but the main principles are the same:\n\n1. Contract outsourcing companies that specialize in one function vs. freelancers whenever\npossible so that if someone is fired, quits, or doesn’t perform, you can replace them without\ninterrupting your business. Hire trained groups of people who can provide detailed reporting and\nreplace one another as needed.\n\n2. Ensure that all outsourcers are willing to communicate among themselves to solve problems, and\ngive them written permission to make most inexpensive decisions without consulting you first U\nstarted at less than $100 and moved to $400 after two months).\n\nHow do you get there? It helps to look at where entrepreneurs typically lose their momentum and stall\npermanently.\n\nMost entrepreneurs begin with the cheapest tools available, bootstrapping and doing things themselves\nto get up and running with little cash. This isn’t the problem. In fact, it’s necessary so that the\nentrepreneurs can train outsourcers later. The problem is that these same entrepreneurs don’t know when\nand how to replace themselves or their homemade infrastructure with something more sealable.\n\nBy “scalable,” I mean a business architecture that can handle 10,000 orders per week as easily as it can\nhandle 10 orders per week. Doing this requires minimizing your decision-making responsibilities, which\nachieves our goal of time freedom while setting the stage for doubling and tripling income with no\nchange in hours worked.\n\nCall the companies at the end of the chapter to research costs. Plan and budget accordingly to upgrade\ninfrastructure at the following milestones, which I measure in units of product shipped:\n\nPhase I: 0-50 Total Units of Product Shipped\n\nDo it all yourself. Put your phone number on the site for both general questions and order-taking—this is\nimportant in the beginning—and take customer calls to determine common questions that you will\nanswer later in an online FAQ. This FAQ will also be the main material for training phone operators and\ndeveloping sales scripts.\n\nIs PPC, an offline advertisement, or your website too vague or misleading, thus attracting unqualified\nand time-consuming consumers’? If so, change them to answer common questions and make the product\nbenefits (including what it isn’t or doesn’t do) clearer.\n\nAnswer all e-mail and save your responses in one folder called “customer service questions.” CC\nyourself on responses and put the nature of the customers’ questions in the subject lines for future\nindexing. Personally pack and ship all product to determine the cheapest options for both. Investigate\nopening a merchant account from your local small bank (easier to get than with a larger bank) for later\noutsourced credit card processing at higher roll-out volumes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013926",
