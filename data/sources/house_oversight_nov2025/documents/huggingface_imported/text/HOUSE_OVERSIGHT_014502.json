Kenneth Mapp said Monday\nhe believes the territory must accept a\nfederal court ruling that found a 2011\ngovernment employee pay cut uncon-\nstitutional.\n\n“After reviewing the case with the at-\ntorney general and reviewing the case\nwith our financial team, I really am of\nthe mind that the government of the\nVirgin Islands should make good on\nthis claim,” Mapp said.\n\nHe said he wants the Legislature to\nsign on to a plan to pay the claim and\naddress other issues by approving in-\ncreased sin taxes, taxes on time-share\noccupants, and changes that set a\nminimum tax for property owners who\nclaim tax credits.\n\nHe said the lawsuit judgement is val-\nued at $65 million.\n\n“We will include all workers affected\nby the cut. In unions, all unions, and out\nof unions,” Mapp said.\n\nThe territory had asked the full 3rd\nUS. Circuit Court of Appeals to recon-\nsider the judgement, which was penned\nby three of the court’s judges.\n\nThe court rejected that request Mon-\nday.\n\nThe governor made his comments\n\nToday\n\nThe Homeland Security, Justice\nand Public Safety Committee will\nmeet at 9 a.m. in the Lawaetz Con-\nference Room on St. Croix to get an\nupdate on the V.I. Police Department,\nthe V.I. Corrections Bureau and the\nVI. Health Department.\n\nWednesday\n\nThe Finance Committee will meet\nat 9a.m. in the Ottley Legislative\nHall on St. Thomas to consider a bill\nrelating to the International Banking\nCenter Regulatory Act and a bill re-\nappropriating $2 million of Luis Hos-\n\nduring a press conference Monday\nmorning on St. Croix.\n\nThe conference originally had been\nscheduled for Friday on St. Thomas,\nbut was delayed for no stated reason.\n\nMapp also announced he has in-\nvoked public exigency authority to\nfast track road repairs in the territory.\n\nHe described public exigency as\n“sort of a public emergency” declara-\ntion that should allow the government\nto more quickly award repair contracts\nfor roadways that have deteriorated\nfollowing extensive rainfall.\n\nMapp said he has consulted with\nfederal authorities and hopes to access\nexisting highway project funds “to use\nthem to get the primary road system\nand secondary road system repaired.”\n\nHe said the work will be done\nunder existing federal road require-\nments, meaning they include proper\ndrainage, sidewalks, striping and other\nelements, “‘all compliant with federal\nhighway and DOT standards.”\n\nRegarding the 3rd Circuit ruling on\nthe 8 percent cuts enacted through the\nVI. Economic Stability Act of 2011,\nMapp said the territory could pay off\nthe amounts due to employees in two\nyears if plaintiffs in the case give the\ngovernment time to make good.\n\nHe said the payments can be satis-\n\nSenate Agenda\n\npital appropriations for the use of the\nHVAC project.\n\nThursday\n\nThe Rules and Judiciary Com-\nmittee will meet at 9 a.m. in Ottley\nLegislative Hall on St. Thomas to\nconsider bills that include a bill to in-\ncrease the Emergency Services Sur-\ncharge from $1 to $2; a bill providing\nfor the disposition of proceeds from\nthe rental or sale of housing units ac-\nquired in the Limetree Bay Terminals\noperating agreement to a bill regard-\ning the establishment of credit unions\nand their oversight; and a bill creating\nthe V.I.

That’s healthy.\nThat’s a benefit,’ Mapp said, referring\nto locals who drink alcohol.\n\nMapp is also seeking a tax on time-\nshare occupants, and wants to require\nthat any resident claiming credits on\nproperty taxes pay a minimum annual\nproperty tax of $360.\n\nHe said the additional tax revenue\ncould also provide $18 million to pay\n\ners Act.\n\nFriday\n\nNo meetings.\n\nGovemor’s\n\nAgenda\nToday\n\nNo appearances scheduled.\n\nGovernment House did not\nprovide Gov.

Right now, people of the\nVirgin Islands are facing a financial\nburden. Now we want to tax them\nmore. That is not appealing to me at\nall,” he said.\n\n“There are some good points” to the\ngovernor’s suggestions, Sanes said. “I\nsee his point. I can understand where\nhe is coming from,” he said.\n\nLame duck Sen. Clifford Graham\nsaid Monday that the promise to repay\ngovernment workers back for the pay\n\ncut won’t be enough to convince legis-\nlators to support Mapp’s proposal.\n\n“The governor has sent us his ver-\nsion of the deficit reduction strategy,”\nGraham said. There are parts that\nsenators will support, and “some we\ndefinitely would not be in favor of,”\nhe said.\n\nGraham said paying back the gov-\nernment employees should be a prior-\nity.\n\n“Are they Number | on the priority\nlist? I think there are more critical is-\nsues now,” Graham said.\n\nGraham said he is not sure whether\nthe 31st Legislature will consider\nMapp’s approvals before it stands\ndown this month.\n\n“T am willing and able to work until\nmy last day,” he said. “I am not sure\nthe calendar will afford us the time to\ndo so.”\n\n— Contact Jonathan Austin at 340-\n714-9104 or email jaustin@dailynews.\nvi.\n\nComing to Join the Vi Dental Team!\n\nPediatric Dentist\n\nCall us!\n\nMake an\nAppointme\n\n340-776-6056\n\nOr.
