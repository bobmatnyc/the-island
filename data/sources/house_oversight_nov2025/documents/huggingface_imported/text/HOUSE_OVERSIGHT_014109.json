Copies of any and all records for the period 1998-2007 reflecting or relating to travel by\nyou and/or any member of your family on any aircraft, boat, helicopter, or other means of\ntransport owned, controlled, or under the direction of Jeffrey Epstein and/or any business entity\nwith which Jeffrey Epstein was affiliated at the time of travel.\n\nRESPONSE:\n\nDefendant objects to this Document Request as overly broad because Jane Doe #3 alleges in the\nJoinder Motion that she was “kept as [Jeffrey Epstein’s] sex slave from about 1999 through\n2002.” Jane Doe #3 further alleges that she “escape[d]” from Mr. Epstein and moved to\nAustralia in 2002. Therefore Defendant objects to this Document Request to the extent that it\npurports to seek documents relating to any time before 1999 or after 2002.
