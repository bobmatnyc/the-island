I hope that you enjoyed your Thanksgiving.\n\nRegarding the issue of due diligence concerning Judge Davis’ selection, I’d like to make a few\nobservations. First, Guy Lewis has known for some time that Judge Davis was making\nreasonable efforts to secure Aaron Podhurst and Bob Josephsberg for this assignment. In fact,\nwhen I told you of Judge Davis’s selection during our meeting last Wednesday, November 21°,\nyou and Professor Dershowitz seemed very comfortable, and certainly not surprised, with the\nselection. Podhurst and Josephsberg are no strangers to nearly the entire Epstein defense team\nincluding Guy Lewis, Lili Ann Sanchez, Roy Black, and, apparently, Professor Dershowitz who\nsaid he knew Mr. Josephsberg from law school. Second, Podhurst and Josephsberg have\nlong-standing stellar reputations for their legal acumen and ethics. It’s hard for me to imagine\nhow much more vetting needs to be done.\n\nThe United States has a statutory obligation (Justice for All Act of 2004) to notify the victims of\nthe anticipated upcoming events and their tights associated with the agreement entered into by\nthe United States and Mr. Epstein in a timely fashion. Tomorrow will make one full week since\nyou were formally notified of the selection. I must insist that the vetting process come to an end,\nTherefore, unless you provide me with a good faith objection to Judge Davis’s selection by COB\ntomorrow, November 28, 2007, I will authorize the notification of the victims. Should you give\nme the go-ahead on Podhurst and Josephsberg selection by COB tomorrow, I will simultaneously\nsend you a draft of the letter. I intend to notify the victims by letter after COB Thursday,\n\nNovember 29\". Thanks,\n\nJeff\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012654",
