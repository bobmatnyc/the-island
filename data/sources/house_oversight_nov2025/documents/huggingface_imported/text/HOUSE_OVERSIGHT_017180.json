  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nAnalogies are, by their nature, matters of degree. Some are closer to the core example than\nothers. But any attempt to analogize political ideas in a pamphlet, ugly parody in a magazine,\noffensive movies in a theater, controversial newspaper articles, or any of the other expressions\nand actions cataloged above to the very different act of shouting “Fire!” in a crowded theater is\neither self-deceptive or self-serving.\n\nAbbie Hoffman, on whose Chicago conspiracy case I worked, once described an occasion when\nhe was standing near a fire with a crowd of people and got in trouble for yelling “Theater,\ntheater!” That, I think, is about as clever and productive a use as anyone has ever made of\nHolmes’s flawed analogy. And it is about the right level of logical response Holmes’s silly\nargument deserves.\n\nIn a 1989 article I wrote criticizing the Holmes Analogy, I concluded with the following plea:\n“Let us hear no more nonsensical analogies to shouting fire in a crowded\n\ntheater. Those who seek to censor speech will just have to come up with a somewhat more\ncogent illustration — one that bears at least some relationship to real speech.” And so, with that\nin mind, I will turn to the other commonly offered exceptions to the First Amendment, some of\nwhich are quite compelling, others less so. In each instance, I will focus on cases I have litigated\nchallenging the exception.\n\n93\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017180",
