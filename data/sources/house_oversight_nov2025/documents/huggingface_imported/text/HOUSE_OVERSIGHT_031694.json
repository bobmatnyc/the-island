He is an angry loser who was married to Annette Tapert years ago.(She now is married to\nJoe Allen and they live near you in PB) Annette left him because there was no bread on the table and he is nasty.\n\nWhat should I do? Call him or not?

Not really.\nWho can? The rich and powerful.\nHuh? All they want is the status quo. Or more.\n\nBut they could --- okay, it's not likely, but they could --- turn on the bad actors at their social/economic level.\nFor example: Wall Street CEOs, donors to the Tea Party, etc.\n\nThat's the topic. Shaming. Shunning.\nOne of the people I deal with --- there are several others. --- is Jeffrey Epstein.\nReading the clips, I don't see that Jeffrey as been shunned.\n\nIn this piece --- http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2011-04-01/bill-clinton-katie-couric-woody-allen-jeffrey-epsteins-\nsociety-friends-close-ranks/ ---\n\nTread:\n\nThe crowd at the events top publicist Peggy Siegal has organized for Epstein proves the point, at least behind closed doors. \"I and\nmany others that know him describe him as brilliant,\" says Siegal.\n\n\"His unique mind is what attracts the world's smartest people to his home.\" Last September, with Siegal's help, Epstein hosted a Break\nFast after Yom Kippur. A group of 120 friends brought their children over for a buffet dinner\n\nThis was just a few months after he finished his prison obligations in Florida.\nAnd here he is, entertaining --- with children present.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031694",
