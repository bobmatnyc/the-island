  "text": "94 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nhumans are naturally hierarchical — not unlike packs of dogs or beached\nwalruses. Humor allows us to test the response of others to statements,\nwhich might otherwise be taken the wrong way. Something said in a\n‘jokey’ tone of voice may not generate a negative response, even though\nthe raw content might be quite provocative. “Ah, late again I see...”\n\nIt is worth taking a look at some great comedy sketches because\nthey bring home the richness of human interaction. Here are some of my\nfavorite links as an antidote to the heavy-duty mathematics I am about\nto inflict on you.\n\nThe World’s Funniest Joke\n\nTwo hunters are out in the woods when one of them collapses. He\ndoesn't seem to be breathing and his eyes are glazed. The other guy\nwhips out his phone and calls the emergency services. He gasps, “My\nfriend is dead! What can I do?” The operator says, “Calm down. I\ncan help. First, let’s make sure he’s dead.” There is a silence, then a\ngunshot is heard. Back on the phone, the guy says, “OK, now what?”\n\nSpike Milligan, from The Goon Show\n\nI think comedy is a fitness display. It demonstrates to those around\nus — particularly of the opposite sex — that we can be creative and use\nnon- computable thought processes, just as dancing is a fitness display of\nour agility and coordination. When we tell a joke we are showing others\nwe can ‘think outside the box’, a valuable survival skill.\n\nAt a simple level it has been proven that animals with the ability to\nbehave randomly escape being eaten more often than animals that follow\na pattern. Non-computability is the ultimate behavioral randomizer\nsince it is not an algorithm and cannot be copied. The ability to take\nnon-computable thinking to its logical conclusion to create and invent\nhas clearly taken off for humans.\n\nOf course, another explanation might be that making people happy\nis fun. People like to be around other fun people so humor encourages\ncrowds to form. If a saber-toothed tiger attacks you, and you are in a\ncrowd, you're more likely to survive. You only have to outrun one\nmember of the crowd!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015784",
