  "text": "Even from jail, Jeffrey Epstein manipulated the system | Miami Herald Page 7 of 17\nCase 1:19-cv-03377 Document 1-1 Filed 04/16/19 Page 8 of 18\n\nRoberts, who showed the Herald the written instructions for the rendezvous, never picked up the girl because Roberts met a man on the trip who would\nbecome her husband. The couple married and moved to Australia, where they currently live.\n\nIn 2007 — at the same time the FBI was investigating Epstein — Roberts, pregnant with her second child, said she unexpectedly received phone calls from\nMaxwell and Epstein. She said they were worried that she had told police about them. She assured them she had not spoken to anyone, she said.\n\nShortly afterward, Roberts said, she was contacted by someone who claimed to be with the FBI. But she was afraid to tell that person details, fearing it was\nreally an Epstein associate posing as an FBI agent.\n\nThat agent, identified in court papers as Timothy Slater, confirmed that he and the other agent on the case, Nesbitt Kuyrkendall, called Roberts in January\nor February 2007. Ina sworn statement, Slater said he informed Roberts that they suspected she was a victim of Epstein’s.\n\nThe agent said Roberts answered basic questions, but became uncomfortable and “asked that I not bother her again.”\n\nRoberts said the agent didn’t try too hard to convince her to talk, and she was surprised when he hung up after asking her a few graphic questions about\nher sex life. She said she was suspicious, but would have cooperated had the FBI talked to her in person and explained why they were asking about\nEpstein.\n\n“T was still scared to death,”’ Roberts said. “Jeffrey used to tell me that he owned the entire Palm Beach Police Department. I just didn’t want my family\nharmed.”\n\nShe nevertheless was listed by federal prosecutors as one of Epstein’s Palm Beach victims.\n\nAs the years went by and Roberts had a daughter, she would be haunted by a fear that Epstein was still taking advantage of young girls. In 2011, she went\npublic in a paid interview with a British tabloid, the Daily Mail, asserting that she had had sex with Prince Andrew, one of Epstein’s friends, several times\nwhen she was a teen.\n\nIn her 2015 affidavit, she discussed in detail some of her alleged sex encounters with the prince and Epstein’s other friends, including lawyer Alan\nDershowitz. Edwards included the affidavit in the court file as part of the Jane Does’ Crime Victims’ Rights Act case, at which time it became public.\n\nVirginia Roberts says she was loaned out by Jeffrey Epstein to his friend Prince Andrew, shown here. He denies they had sex. COURTESY OF VIRGINIA ROBERTS\n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/news/local/article2 19494920 html 4/3/2019\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017970",
