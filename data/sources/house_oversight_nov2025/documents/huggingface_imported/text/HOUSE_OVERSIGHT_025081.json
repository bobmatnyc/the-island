  "text": "hills, valleys, and rising apartment blocks --\nthe future he was in the process of building\n-- stretched out in front of him.\n\n\"On a good, clear day, you can see Tel\nAviv, Ashdod, and Ashkelon,\" he told me.\n\"One-third of Palestine and Israel.\" Rawabi\nis in the second-largest, yet most sparsely-\npopulated Area A in the West Bank -- from\nthe terrace, which faces away from Ateret,\nyou can see expanses of mostly-empty\nhills. Perhaps in Masri's mind, they are\nawaiting Rawabis of their own. When I\nreturned to Washington, I asked him in a\nphone interview if he viewed his project as\nthe first of many such planned cities in\nPalestine. \"I always say our success 1s\nmeasured not by how many homes we sell.\nIt is measured when a second Rawabi is\nestablished,” he told me.\n\nStanding on the terrace, I asked him if his\nwillingness to undertake such a massive\nproject reflected any optimism about the\ncoming years -- no one invests this much\ntime, money, and energy into something if\nthey expect war is on the horizon. \"This\nproject is built for today's politics,\" he\nreplied. \"If it gets a little worse, or a little\nbetter -- fine. If it gets really bad, we're in\ntrouble. If it doesn't, then great.
