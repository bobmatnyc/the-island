In particular, Wiener’s applications of cybernetic\nconcepts to the brain and to computerized perception are the direct precursors of today’s\nneural-network-based deep-learning circuits, and of artificial intelligence itself. But\ncurrent developments in these fields have diverged from his vision, and their future\ndevelopment may well affect the human uses both of human beings and of machines.\n\nWhat Wiener Got Wrong\n\nIt is exactly in the extension of the cybernetic idea to human beings that Wiener’s\nconceptions missed their target. Setting aside his ruminations on language, law, and\nhuman society for the moment, look at a humbler but potentially useful innovation that he\nthought was imminent in 1950. Wiener notes that prosthetic limbs would be much more\neffective if their wearers could communicate directly with their prosthetics by their own\nneural signals, receiving information about pressure and position from the limb and\ndirecting its subsequent motion. This turned out to be a much harder problem than\nWiener envisaged: Seventy years down the road, prosthetic limbs that incorporate neural\nfeedback are still in the very early stages. Wiener’s concept was an excellent one—it’s\njust that the problem of interfacing neural signals with mechanical-electrical devices is\nhard.\n\nMore significantly, Wiener (along with pretty much everyone else in 1950)\ngreatly underappreciated the potential of digital computation. As noted, Wiener’s\nmathematical contributions were to the analysis of signals and noise and his analytic\nmethods apply to continuously varying, or analog, signals. Although he participated in\nthe wartime development of digital computation, he never foresaw the exponential\nexplosion of computing power brought on by the introduction and progressive\nminiaturization of semiconductor circuits. This is hardly Wiener’s fault: The transistor\nhadn’t been invented yet, and the vacuum-tube technology of the digital computers he\nwas familiar with was clunky, unreliable, and unscalable to ever larger devices. In an\nappendix to the 1948 edition of Cybernetics, he anticipates chess-playing computers and\npredicts that they’ll be able to look two or three moves ahead. He might have been\nsurprised to learn that within half a century a computer would beat the human world\nchampion at chess.\n\nTechnological Overestimation and the Existential Risks of the Singularity\n\nWhen Wiener wrote his books, a significant example of technological overestimation was\nabout to occur. The 1950s saw the first efforts at developing artificial intelligence, by\nresearchers such as Herbert Simon, John McCarthy, and Marvin Minsky, who began to\nprogram computers to perform simple tasks and to construct rudimentary robots. The\nsuccess of these initial efforts inspired Simon to declare that “machines will be capable,\nwithin twenty years, of doing any work a man can do.” Such predictions turned out to be\nspectacularly wrong. As they became more powerful, computers got better and better at\nplaying chess because they could systematically generate and evaluate a vast selection of\npossible future moves. But the majority of predictions of AI, e.g., robotic maids, turned\nout to be illusory. When Deep Blue beat Garry Kasparov at chess in 1997, the most\n\n20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016240",
