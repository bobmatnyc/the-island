U.S.C.A. Const.\nAmends. 5, 14.\n\nSee publication Words and Phras-\nes for other judicial constructions\nand definitions.\n\n53. Constitutional Law ¢=305(5)\n\nIn determining whether the exercise\nof personal jurisdiction is reasonable under\nthe Due Process Clause, a court is to\nconsider: (1) the burden that the exercise\nof jurisdiction will impose on the defen-\ndant; (2) the interests in the forum state\nin adjudicating the case; (3) the plaintiffs\ninterest in obtaining convenient and effec-\ntive relief; (4) the interstate judicial sys-\ntem’s interest in obtaining the most effi-\ncient resolution of the controversy; and (5)\nthe shared interest of the states in further-\ning substantive social policies. U.S.C.A.\nConst.Amends. 5, 14.\n\n54.

Federal Civil Procedure €-1269.1\nCourts are not obligated to subject a\nforeign defendant to discovery where the\nallegations of jurisdictional facts, con-\nstrued in plaintiffs’ favor, fail to state a\n\nbasis for the exercise of jurisdiction or\nwhere discovery would not uncover suffi-\ncient facts to sustain jurisdiction.\n\n57.
