  "text": "In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)\n\nwhy the district court disregarded and failed to credit plaintiffs’ extensive, entirely adequate pleadings, see infra Point I.B.2;\nfailed to draw reasonable inferences from those pleadings, see infra *76 I.B.3; and declined to accept the truth of the facts\nalleged by plaintiffs, see infra Point LB.4.\n\nApplication of this heightened standard is especially misguided in light of Congress’s intent that the ATA reach just the\nconduct that plaintiffs allege. That is, “Congress[] clearly expressed [an] intent to cut off the flow of money to terrorists at\nevery point along the causal chain of violence.” Boim J, 291 F.3d at 1021. Congress did this by “attach[ing] liability to all\ndonations to foreign terrorist organizations regardless of the giver’s intent” because “foreign organizations that engage in\nterrorist activity are so tainted by their criminal conduct that any contribution to such an organization facilitates that\nconduct.” Jd. at 1027. Moreover, Congress enacted Section 2339B, a criminal provision incorporated through the ATA, out\nof a “concern that terrorist organizations could raise funds ‘under the cloak of a humanitarian or charitable exercise.’ ” Weiss,\n453 F. Supp. 2d at 626 (quoting H.R. Rep. 104-393, at 43 (1995)). That statute was designed to “ ‘severely restrict the ability\nof terrorist organizations to raise much needed funds for their terrorist acts within the United States.’ ” Jd. Any effort to\nimpose a heightened pleading standard upon terrorism-related *77 cases, as the district court did, thus “thwart[s] Congress’\nclearly expressed intent.” Boim J, 291 F.3d at 1021.\n\n2. The District Court Understated and Ignored Plaintiffs’ Extensive Pleadings Addressing Defendants’ Knowing and\nReckless Support of Terrorism.\n\nAlthough the district court acknowledged that plaintiffs had in certain respects pled that the defendants knowingly provided\nsupport to al-Qaeda,\" it radically understated the scope and detail surrounding those direct allegations. Far from presenting\nbare conclusions, plaintiffs abundantly provided defendants with notice of the basis for plaintiffs’ claims, including their\nassertion that defendants sought to advance al-Qaeda’s activities.\n\nFor each defendant, plaintiffs’ detailed allegations focused on the knowing or reckless nature of the provision of support to\nal-Qaeda. The particular allegations set forth below are in addition to plaintiffs’ extensive allegations regarding the broader\ncontext of al-Qaeda’s use and development of a financing network, the relation between the key financiers and financing\nmechanisms and al-Qaeda’s operations, and the integration of sources of financing into the broader social and ideological *78\nnetwork of persons and organizations that facilitated al-Qaeda’s activities. See supra pp. 29-60.\n\n(a) Al Rajhi Bank\n\nAl Rajhi Bank was founded in 1987 and “has a network of nearly 400 branch offices throughout Saudi Arabia and seventeen\nworldwide subsidiaries.” SPA55 (Terrorist Attacks 1). Plaintiffs’ complaints contain numerous allegations that Al Rajhi Bank\nknowingly provided an extensive amount of material support to al-Qaeda front charities, including the International Islamic\nRelief Organization (“IIRO”), the Muslim World League (““MWL”), the World Association of Muslim Youth (““WAMY”),\nthe Benevolent International Foundation (“BIF”), the Saudi Joint Relief Committee (““SJRC”), and Al Haramain Islamic\nFoundation (“Al Haramain’”). See SPA55 (Terrorist Attacks I; JA1062-65, 1069-77, 3827-29. Its provision of material\nsupport included “knowingly and intentionally provid [ing] financial and bank account services” for al-Qaeda front charities\nand “September 11th hijacker Abdulaziz al-Omari.” JA1062-77, 1784, 2483, 3827-29.'\" “Al Rajhi Bank has long known that\nthe[se] *79 accounts ... were being used to solicit and transfer funds to terrorist organizations, including al Qaida.” JA3828.\nThrough these bank accounts, Al Rajhi Bank “knowingly and intentionally ... facilitated [the] purchase of weapons and\nmilitary equipment.” JA2483. Al Rajhi Bank also “knowingly and intentionally lent repeated material support to Al Qaeda,”\nincluding the front charities, “through, inter alia, the use of interstate and international faxes, telephones, wire transfers and\ntransmissions, and mailings.” JA1064, 1784.\n\nThe complaints further allege that Al Rajhi Bank knowingly provided material support through its involvement in raising\nfunds for al-Qaeda’s front charities, including by making direct donations to them, JA1068-73, 2483, guiding the donations\nof its customers, JA1069-70, cooperating with the charities to advertise the existence of their bank accounts, XXXXXX, and\nmanaging and accounting for donations, JA1071. Donations were often made as part of the Islamic duties of zakat and\nharam, which include an obligation by the donor “to determine” (7.e., know) that “the ultimate *80 recipients of these\n\nWESTLAW\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023388",
