  "text": "yellow yo-yo and said, “This will really please the crowd. It’ s an official\nRoy Acuff model.” | put the yo-yo in my pocket. Haldeman did not\nmention that the string had been loosened at the bottom, so when | was\nonstage and | flung that yo-yo down, it just stayed there. Once again,\nHaldeman had transformed the president into an asshole.\n\nIt was Haldeman who had urged me to Install the White House\ntaping system. It was Haldeman who hired Alexander Butterfield, who\ntestified to the whole world about the tapes, and told the FBI about E.\nHoward Hunt. Butterfield brought in Al Wong to set up the system and\ncheck it every day. And it was Wong who brought James McCord onto the\nteam. It all seems so obvious now.\n\nOne thing about Gerald Ford, though: He keeps his promises—not\nonly to pardon me, but also his promise to fire Alexander Butterfield, even\nthough Ford was actually grateful to him. As for me, | should have listened\nto L. Patrick Gray when he warned me, “People on your staff are trying to\nmortally wound you.”\n\nMy wife, Pat, has sworn to me that she never told anyone about our\nmarital difficulties, and of course | believe her, so the leak to Woodward\nand Bernstein could on/y have come from Haldeman. On top of all his\n\nother betrayals, he must have been Deep Throat too.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015127",
