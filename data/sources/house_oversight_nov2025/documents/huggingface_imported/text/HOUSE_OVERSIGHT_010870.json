That sounds about right, yeah.\n\nQ. So Mr. Dershowitz did not ignore the letter;\nhe responded to it, correct?\n\nA. I think that's right.\n\nQ. And go back to the first letter.\n\nA. But, now, if we are -- if we're talking\nabout -- yeah, there's that one letter and now there's a\nresponse letter, right.\n\nQ. My question to you is: Does the statement to\n@ person that \"we have reason to believe that you have\npersonally observed another person in the presence of\nunderage females and we would like to ask you about your\nobservations,” put the recipient on notice that you,\nyourself, are accused of criminal conduct in abusing\nminors?\n\nA. Well, it puts you on notice that you're a\npotential, obviously, witness to this and then therefore\nyou could have potential involvement.\n\nLet me give you a simple iHustration. It'll\ntake about 20 seconds. If somebody says --\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n269\nQ. Well, let me back up. My first question,\nthough, if you can answer the question.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: No. I'm sorry. The witness is\nentitled to complete his response. If you\ndon't -- if you believe it to be unresponsive,\nyou can move to strike it, but he’s entitled to\ncomplete it.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: He --\n\nMR. SCAROLA: So go ahead and complete your\nresponse.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Can we have a -- you can give\nan explanation, but a yes or no with an\nexplanation.\n\nMR, SCAROLA: You already got that. Could we\nnow have the completion of the response?\n\nTHE WITNESS: Here's the simple illustration\nI think makes it pretty clear: If somebody says,\nwe have observed you in the presence of a kilo of\ncocaine, we would like to question you about the\npresence -- about your observations of this, that\ndoesn't directly state that you are a drug user\nor a drug dealer, but it certainly puts you on\nnotice that you're associated with that criminal\nactivity and somebody is going to question you\nabout it.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n02:35:33\n\n02:35:35\n\n02:35:37\n\n02:35:41\n\n02:35:45\n\n02:35:45\n\n02:35:49\n\nOn Oa kh &W bw =\n\n02:36:52\n02:35:54 9\n02:35:57 1 0\n02:35:57 1 1\n02:35:59 1 2\n02:36:02 1 3\n02:36:05 1 4\n02:36:08 1 5\n02:36:09 1 6\nozast2 17\n02:36:14 1 8\n02:36:16 1 9\n02:36:18 20\n02:36:22 21\n02:36:28 22\n02:36:34 23\no2zae33 24\n02:36:33 25\n\n02:36:37\n02:38:39\n02:36:39\n02:36:41\n02:36:44\n02:36:47\n\n02:36:50\n\nOn aah WH =\n\n02:36:52\nozsese 9\n02:36:59 10\noza702 11\nozar0s 12\no2ar09 13\nozs712 14\nozaris 15\n02:37:21 16\nozar21 17\noz3723 18\nozsr24 19\nozar2r 20\no23730 21\no2z37:33 22\n02:37:36 23\no2ar37 24\nozar3zs 25\n\nPage 268 to 271 of 335\n\n270\n\nIn the context of this case, to say, you have\n\nbeen observed in the -- in -- by numerous\nwitnesses in the presence of a convicted sex\noffender and underage girls, and we would like to\ntalk to you about those observations, I think\nthat puts you on notice that you're in -- in --\n\nin jeopardy of -- of criminal activity,\n\nparticularly when you combine that with the fact\nthat there is a duty to report child abuse in\n\nmany states in this country, including the State\nof Florida.\n\nAnd so that if those observations were such\nthat they would give rise to a reasonable\ninference that sex abuse was -- of children was\ngoing on and you'd be obligated to report it, as\nI think Mr. Dershowitz conceded yesterday, yes,\nyou -- I think that puts you on notice that --\nthat those kinds of things are being alleged.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. So, first, the letter itself, the letter from\nMr. Scarola simply says, you were -- you were personally\n-- you personally observed Jeffrey Epstein in the\npresence of underaged females, correct?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. It does not say, you witnessed abuse of any\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n271\nminor; we have reason to believe you observed abuse of\nminors?\n\nA. If those words do not appear there, but come\non, we -- we know -- we know in the context of this\ncase, when somebody is asking to take a deposition about\nyour observation of young girls, they weren't talking\nabout preparations for birthday parties. They were\ntalking about sexual abuse of children.\n\nAnd that was what Mr. Dershowitz was going to\nbe asked about. And he did not -- he did not take that\nopportunity to try to clear the record; Instead, we are,\nyou know, here today, because among other reasons, he --\nhe -- he wasn't deposed then.\n\nQ. I want -- I want to comment. I'm just a\nlittle bit non -- nonplussed, so I want to come back to\nthis again.\n\nA. Well, I'm -- I have to tell you, I'm a little\nbit nonplussed that somebody would say that letter\ndoesn't put you on notice that you're potentially\ninvolved in criminal activity. I mean, come on.\n\nQ. 1 -- my question wasn't potentially involved\nin criminal activity. We disagree about whether it does\nthat.\n\nA. Okay. I think it does.\n\nQ. I suspect you -- that's how you read it?\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n30 of 46 sheets\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010870",
