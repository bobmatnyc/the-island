  "text": "I could see that Little Pines was a kind of fiction. All you had to do was take\na map and draw in the 40-kilometer line. In the areas nearer the Mediterranean,\nin the western and central parts of the border area, it indeed covered territory\ncontrolled by armed PLO groups. But in the eastern sector, there were Syrian\npositions a mere 10 to 12 kilometers up from the border, well inside the\n“security zone”. Not much further north were two full Syrian divisions. That\nmeant we’d be fighting not just the Palestinians, which was the ostensible aim\nof Little Pines. We would have to take on Syria. As soon as those hostilities\nbegan, we would have to destroy radar and SAM sites in the Syrian-controlled\nBeka’a Valley further north into Lebanon. After the first costly days of the 1973\nwar in the Sinai, we were not about to enter a major conflict without ensuring\nair superiority. Unless the Syrians retreated or surrendered, the inevitable result\nwould be a wider conflict, not limited to dealing with Palestinian fighters in\nsouth Lebanon but paving the way for Arik to go ahead with his original plan\nand push all the way to Beirut.\n\nThis wasn’t mere supposition on my part. In February 1982, we ran a\nsimulation exercise in the kirya based on Plan B. The result: Little Pines became\nBig Pines. A clash with the Syrians proved inevitable, if only because one target\neven under Little Pines was the main road between Beirut and Damascus. It lay\nwell beyond the 40-kilometer line. As the main supply route for their forces in\nthe interior of Lebanon, it was also of critical importance for the Syrians. So any\nidea of a quick, limited strike to establish a security zone was fantasy. A few\ndays later, Raful chaired a wide-ranging discussion on Lebanon. Near the end of\nthe session, I asked him directly whether government ministers were aware that\nour war plan “will inevitably lead to a clash with the Syrians”. Raful hesitated\nfor a second, but then answered briskly: “Yes.”\n\nThat assurance would turn out to be untrue. But my wider concern, as the\nweeks passed, was Arik’s political plan, of which I was getting an ever clearer\nidea from him. It struck me as not just grand, but grandiose. Part of it was to\nobliterate Arafat as a political force, if not by killing him then by forcing him\nand every one of his fighters from Lebanon, a country Arik wanted to place\nunder the unchallenged control of the most prominent of the younger generation\nof Christian Phalangist politicians, Bashir Gemayel. I felt all that would be\nchallenging enough. But in Arik’s eyes, this was only part of a complete\nreordering of our conflict with the Arabs. He expected Gemayel’s Lebanon to\nopenly align itself with Israel and expel all Syrian troops. As for the expelled\nPalestinians, they would go back to Jordan where they would resume — and, this\ntime, win — their civil war with King Hussein. The result, with Hussein deposed,\n\n195\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011666",
