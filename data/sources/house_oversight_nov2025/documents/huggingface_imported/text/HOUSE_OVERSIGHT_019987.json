We all salute with\npride the same American flag ... and we are all equal, equal in the eyes of Almighty\nGod... . We’re equal ... and I want to thank, by the way, the evangelical community, the\nChristian community, communities of faith, rabbis and priests and pastors, ministers,\nbecause the support for me, as you know, was a record, not only numbers of people but\npercentages of those numbers who voted for Trump ... an amazing outpouring and I will\nnot disappoint you ... as long as we have faith in each other and trust in God then there is\nno goal beyond our reach ... there is no dream too large ... no task too great ... we are\nAmericans and the future belongs to us ... America is roaring. It’s going to be bigger and\nbetter and stronger than ever before... .”\n\nInside the West Wing, some had idly speculated about how long he would go on if he\ncould command time as well as language. The consensus seemed to be forever. The sound\nof his own voice, his lack of inhibition, the fact that linear thought and presentation turned\nout not at all to be necessary, the wonder that this random approach seemed to command,\nand his own replenishing supply of free association—all this suggested that he was limited\nonly by everyone else’s schedule and attention span.\n\nTrump’s extemporaneous moments were always existential, but more so for his aides\nthan for him. He spoke obliviously and happily, believing himself to be a perfect pitch\nraconteur and public performer, while everyone with him held their breath. If a wackadoo\nmoment occurred on the occasions—the frequent occasitons—when his remarks careened\nin no clear direction, his staff had to go into intense method-acting response. It took\nabsolute discipline not to acknowledge what everyone could see.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nAs the president finished up his speech, Richard Spencer, who in less than four months\nfrom the Trump election was on his way to becoming the most famous neo-Nazi in\nAmerica since George Lincoln Rockwell, had returned to a seat in the atrium of the\nGaylord Resort to argue his affinity for Donald Trump—and, he believed, vice versa.\n\nSpencer, curiously, was one of the few people trying to ascribe an intellectual doctrine\nto Trumpism. Between those taking him literally but not seriously, and those taking him\nseriously but not literally, there was Richard Spencer. Practically speaking, he was doing\nboth, arguing the case that if Trump and Bannon were the pilot fish for a new conservative\nmovement, Spencer himself—the owner of altright.com and, he believed, the purest\nexponent of the movement—was their pilot fish, whether they knew it or not.\n\nAs close to a real-life Nazi as most reporters had ever seen, Spencer was a kind of\ncatnip for the liberal press crowded at CPAC.
