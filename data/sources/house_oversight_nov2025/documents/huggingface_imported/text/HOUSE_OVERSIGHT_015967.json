The obvious place to turn is the quantum world.\n\nQuantum Computers\n\nQuantum computers have had an extraordinary run in the press recently.\nIt has been variously claimed they offer limitless computing power and\ncan break all known security schemes; cracking, for example, the prime\nfactors that form the basis of public key cryptography. This is big news.\nThese codes are used to protect all the financial transactions we make on\nthe web.\n\nIna regular computer, bits of information are processed by switches\nthat make simple ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decisions. In a quantum computer each\nswitch can take both the yes and no branches, at least fora short time called\nthe decoherence interval. The calculations are said to be superposed.\nThis allows a quantum computer to calculate exponentially, rather than\nlinearly, as the number of logic gates increases. Grover’s algorithm and\nShor’s algorithm use this superposition to speed up factoring numbers\nand looking things up in databases, respectively.\n\nGrover’s algorithm gives us the ability to find something stored ina\nrandom place without having to look in every box. If you think about a\nstandard search, say for your lost car keys, you must look everywhere to\nguarantee finding them. It does not much matter in what order you do it.\nWhen you are halfway through the search, you will be 50% likely to have\nfound your keys. But, with a quantum computer, you can be fuzzy and\nlook in many places at once. A quarter of the way through a quantum\nsearch, you are 50% likely to have found your keys. That might sound\nlike a small improvement, but when working with very big numbers, it\nmakes an enormous difference.\n\nShor’s algorithm works a little differently and, yes, it does allow\na quantum computer to break Internet encryption, so the newspaper\nheadlines are true up to a point. Some time in the future we will need to\nmove to a more secure type of encryption.\n\nThe largest quantum computers today can process 300 qubits at\na time or remain ‘coherent’ for about two seconds. These results are\npitifully low. The largest prime number factored so far is 143, a mere 7\nbits long! By way of comparison, internet security routinely uses 1024\nbits. But, quantum computers are improving exponentially faster than\nclassical computers: They really do change the rules of the game.
