  "text": "However, the ways in which sociopaths differ from psychopaths is key to\nunderstanding their evolutionary utility. For example, psychopaths are more likely\nthan the general public to be violent and to end up incarcerated. Narcissistic\nsociopaths, on the other hand, are usually nonviolent and happy to work within a\nsystem of laws and norms, insofar as it suits their goals, because, while they do not\nhesitate to harm others, it isn’t a specific aim. Instead, they are highly motivated\ntoward the accumulation of riches and influence; whereas psychopaths are often\nmotivated toward sadistic self-gratification and generally do not seek positions of\npower and wealth per se. (There is some crossover between these phenotypes and\nsociopaths who do find gratification in hurting others are labeled malignant\nsociopaths.) Finally, narcissistic sociopaths always seek reproductive success\nthrough procreation and aggressive nepotism, which is usually accompanied by\nextreme in-group identification, e.g. racism, xenophobia, and nationalism, while\npsychopaths show no allegiance to family, community, or country.\n\nTherefore, the phenotype of the narcissistic sociopath is not a bizarre combination\nof traits, but rather a set of highly attuned social skills and behaviors aimed at\nincreasing long-term biological fitness through wealth, status, power, and the future\nsuccess of progeny. In order words, sociopaths are highly adapted. The evolutionary\npuzzle is not found in the phenotype itself but rather in the interaction of sociopaths\nwith the society in which they exist. Social groups can detect dishonest and\nmanipulative behaviors and act to punish the actors in order to either correct the\nantisocial behavior or remove them from the group. Dozens of mammal species\nhave shown this very sophisticated and elastic social behavior, but humans and our\nclose relatives are especially apt at detecting and punishing cheaters, freeloaders,\nand liars.\n\nThis sets up both a short-term conflict and long-term evolutionary battle between\nmanipulative narcissistic sociopaths and the rest of society, that is, those who do not\nwish to be manipulated. Most individuals in a society share a vested interest in\nmaintaining fairness and social order. The equilibrium point is reached through a\nconcept called frequency-dependent selection, the essence of which is that\nphenotypes can sometimes have distinct advantages precisely because they are rare.\nUnder this paradigm, the infrequency of sociopaths in a population is essential to\ntheir success.\n\nCurrent estimates place the prevalence of narcissistic sociopathy at 1-2% and\nscholars have held that this rate appears stable across societies and over recorded\nhistory (insofar as such a phenotype and its frequency can be inferred from\nhistorical sources). This makes sociopathy a candidate phenotype for frequency-\ndependent selection, especially given how successful they often are. The rarity of\nnarcissistic sociopaths in the population, along with their considerable skill in\nhiding their true motivations, makes them very difficult to detect. If they were more\nnumerous, however, members of society would become familiar with this particular\npattern of social deviance and quickly learn to neutralize it. Furthermore, when\nnarcissists encounter one another, while they may be willing to cooperate with each\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033324",
