  "text": "he’s... well, nobody knows what.\n\nFor a period, one part of his activities he says is recovering monies for\ncountries looted by exiled dictators or military strongmen. If early in his career he\nmight seem like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical resemblance) in\nBreakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s George Peppard in Banacek, a\nsmart and astute operator.\n\nThen, in his version, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy people and\nfamilies. He’s not just doing their bidding or their investing, he’s helping them to\nnavigate the potententials of their wealth. They’ ve satisfied their business dreams.\nNow there are the separate challenges and possibilities .\n\nIn essence, as Epstein becomes more of a public figure the response to this\ndescription of his livelihood, is, in the media and in high social circles, “bullshit.”\nTrue, however , there is no clear alternate narrative. No one is accusing him of\nanything, accept, sometimes, guilt by association. (In addition to Robert Maxwell,\nwho will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a New York high\nflyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom Epstein acted as a\nconsultant—along with, he points out, Paul Volcker.) But the characterization\npersist: if it’s not clear, it must be murky. Sure, Goldman Sachs partners and tech\ngeniuses, they might have stratospheric wealth, but what to make of a Coney\nIsland, Zelig-like no-namer?\n\nIn 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television\nacknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting with\nhis arm around Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in London\n(Diana is wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon Carter, into his\nsecond years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner. Epstein’s rise and\nCarter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation, that different. Both are a\nfunction of the age of new money, both are helped by strategic relationships with\nthe exceptionally wealthy (1.e. they are social climbers), both men have made\nthemselves up. To say that Epstein, in the company of the Princess, sticks in\nCarter’s craw would be a big understatement. Epstein becomes one of the “what do\nyou know about him” figures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. A\nvariety of the gossip that begins to circulate about Epstein—for instance, that he\nsecretly films his guests—is seeded by Carter, who once advised me not to go to\nEpstein’s house or accept a ride in his car least I risk being blackmail. (“For\nwhat?” I asked Carter. “You can’t even begin to imagine,” said Carter.)\n\nEpstein is playing a cat and mouse game with his own growing wealth and\ninfluence. He is private and secretive, but grandly so. He joins the board of\nRockefeller University. He’s suddenly on the Trilateral commission, that cabal of\nbusiness people who fancy themselves, and who are fancied by conspiracy buffs,\nas running the world.
