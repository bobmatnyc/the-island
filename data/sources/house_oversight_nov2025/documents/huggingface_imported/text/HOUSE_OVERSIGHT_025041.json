One was stubbornly slow \neconomic growth. The other was the long-\nterm threat to prosperity posed by the \nstructural mismatch between the federal \ngovernment's projected revenue and its \nspending commitments. A successful \nsecond term for Mr. Obama will require \nboth credible proposals for overcoming \nthose related challenges and the \ndetermination to carry them through. \nThe president addressed the deficit and \ndebt first, and at some length. This was \nfitting, giving that the most pressing piece \nof business facing Washington is what to \ndo about the impending $85 billion across-\nthe-board spending cut.

But his plan to avoid it basically \nrepeated the offer of a \"balanced approach\" \n— unspecified tax hikes and spending cuts \n— which Republicans have already \nrejected. \nSomewhat more substantively, he called for \na larger deficit-reduction deal built around \nloophole-closing tax reform and what he \ncalled \"modest\" reforms to Medicare and \nentitlements. In an apparent effort to rally \nDemocrats to this cause, he called on \n\"those of us who care deeply about \nprograms like Medicare\" to \"embrace\" \nreform. \nYet in promising the same amount of \nMedicare savings as the Simpson-Bowles \ncommision proposed, Mr. Obama did not \nmention that this would be a mere $341 \nbillion over 10 years. All told, he envisions \nshaving an additional $1.5 trillion off \nprojected deficits over 10 years, which \nwould leave the national debt at a \nhistorically aberrant 70-odd percent of \ngross domestic product. In short, he \ndeclined to push back against the mind-set \nwithin his party that considers acceptable \n\"stabilizing\" the debt at this level by the \ntime Mr. Obama's second term ends. At \nbest, that would buy a respite of a few \nyears before the debt resumed its upward \nclimb. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025042 \nAs for raising the economy's growth \npotential, the president was more \npersuasive. His emphasis on reforming the \ntangled and counterproductive corporate \ntax code was especially welcome, and \nrelatively likely to draw GOP support. He \noffered several promising ideas on \neducation, including a promise of \"high-\nquality preschool\" for all children, though \nhow that would square with his promise not \nto increase the deficit by a single dime \nwent unexplained. He sounded a ringing \ncall for greater federal attention to college \ncost containment. \"Taxpayers can't keep on \nsubsidizing\" spiraling tuition, he said, \ncandidly and correctly. \nAs European trading partners had hoped, \nthe president endorsed negotiations for a \ntransatlantic free-trade zone, which would \nhelp America's export industries and the \njobs that depend on them. Coupled with an \nagreement that Obama is promoting for the \nPacific region, the proposal has the \npotential to make his second term fruitful \nfor global trade. He also suggested raising \nthe federal minimum wage, from $7.25 per \nhour to $9 — although the precise amount \nis less important, in our view, than the \npresident's call for annual cost-of-living \nadjustments. \nIn keeping with Mr. Obama's theme of \nnation-building at home, foreign policy \nplayed a secondary role in his speech. He \npromised to bring home half of the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025043 \nremaining U.S. troops in Afghanistan \nwithin the next year. But officials said the \nwithdrawal would be weighted toward \nyear's end, leaving most of the troops to \npartner with Afghan troops for much of this \nyear. The president said the United States \nwould support democratic transitions in the \nMiddle East, \"keep the pressure on [the] \nSyrian regime\" and \"do what is necessary \nto prevent\" Iran from obtaining a nuclear \nweapon — but he offered no specifics. \nMr. Obama pressed his case for reform of \nimmigration laws and for action to slow \nglobal warming — and, in especially \nmoving terms, tougher gun laws. In each \ncase, there may be measures he can take \nthrough executive action, but new laws will \nbe needed for substantial progress. \nMr. Obama was right when he pointed to \nthe survivors and grieving relatives of gun \nviolence victims and insisted, \"They \ndeserve a vote.\" \nArticle 2 \nForeign Policy \nThe world is no longer \nAmerica's problem  \nAaron David Miller \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025044 \nFebruary 13, 2013 -- If you want to know \nwhat an American president's foreign \npolicy is likely to be, particularly in a \nsecond term, don't listen to his State of the \nUnion speech. You'd probably have more \nluck playing with Tarot cards, or reading \ntea leaves or goat entrails. But not this year. \nBarack Obama's fourth such address left a \ntrail of foreign-policy cookie crumbs that \nlead directly to some pretty clear, if hardly \nsurprising or revolutionary, conclusions. \nHis first term contained no spectacular \nsuccesses (save killing Osama bin Laden), \nbut no spectacular failures either. And \nmore than likely, that's what the president \nwill settle for in a second, even as the Arab \nworld burns and rogues like Iran and North \nKorea brandish new weapons. He's nothing \nif not a cautious man. \nBehold: I am the Extricator in Chief \nAfghanistan -- the \"good war\" -- has been \npretty much MIA in Obama's speeches \nsince he became president. He's alternated \nbetween spending a few words on the \nmission there (2009) or a paragraph (2010, \n2011, 2012). If his words have been brief, \nthe message has been stunningly clear: It's \nabout the leaving. And tonight was no \nexception. Not more than two minutes in, \nthe president spoke about America's men \nand women coming home from \nAfghanistan. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025045 \nObama's signature is indeed that of the \nextricator. And he broke the code early (the \n2009 surge was designed politically to get \nin so that he could get out with a clearer \nconscience). He is the president who has \nwound down the longest and among the \nmost profitless wars in American history, \nwhere victory was never defined by \nwhether we can win, but by when can we \nleave. It is his legacy, and one about which \nhe has reason to be proud. Obama has left \nhimself and his military commanders \nplenty of discretion about the pace of \nextrication. But that's fine with the \npresident so long as they're heading for the \nexits. \nNot the Destroyer and Rebuilder of Worlds \nSurprise, surprise: There was scant mention \nof Syria in the president's speech -- just one \nthrowaway line about supporting Syria's \nopposition. Obama did not disengage from \nIraq and Afghanistan only to plunge \nAmerica into new black holes in the \nMiddle East. \nObama isn't worried about boots on the \nground in Syria. That was never on the \ntable. Instead the question is this: Given the \nuncertainty about the end state in Syria and \nthe risks of providing serious weapons to \nthe rebels (and a no-fly zone) that might \nalter the arc of the fight against the regime, \nthe president saw and continues to see no \npurpose in America providing arms of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025046 \nmarginal utility. That course would either \nexpose him to be truly weak and ineffectual \nor lead to calls to do more. So he's going to \nprovide non-lethal support and is \napparently prepared to take the hits from \ncritics who see the president's policy as \npassive, cruel, and unforgiving, particularly \nnow that we know that members of his own \ncabinet clearly wanted to do more. The \nIranian nuclear issue, the other potential tar \nbaby in the SOTU, followed a pretty \npredictable rising arc of concern in the list \nof presidential foreign-policy worries. In \n2009, in Obama's address to a joint session \nof Congress (a speech some regard as a \nSOTU), Iran wasn't even mentioned. In the \n2010 SOTU, Obama threatened that if Iran \nignored its international obligations, there \nwould be consequences; in 2011, he did the \nsame; and in 2012, he made it clear that he \nwould prevent Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear weapon and take no option off the \ntable. Obama repeated half of what he said \nin 2012 about preventing Iran from getting \na nuclear weapon, but instead of saying all \noptions were on the table, he spoke of the \nimportance of diplomacy. I suspect he'll go \nto extreme lengths to avoid war, and won't \ngreenlight an Israeli attack either until the \narc of diplomacy has run its course. And \nthen Obama would likely act only if the \nmullahs push the envelope by accelerating \ntheir uranium enrichment program and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025047 \nother military aspects of the nuclear \nenterprise. \nSeizing the Nuclear High Road with Little \nto Lose \nEven as he confronts a real bomb in North \nKorea (very bad options there) and a \npotential one in Iran (bad options there \ntoo), Obama is trying to make good on a \nlongstanding commitment to reduce \nAmerica's own nuclear arsenal. Backed by \nthe military chiefs and likely by the public \ntoo (getting rid of nukes equals saving \nmoney), but opposed by Republicans in \nCongress, Obama will try to work around \nthe political obstacles by seeking a deal \nwith yes ... you got it ... his old friend Vlad \nPutin. It's worth a try. If Putin balks or \nRepublicans get in the way, the president \ncan always advocate unilateral cuts -- not \nsomething he wants to do. But if he can't \nhave his way on nukes, he can always \nblame it on the Russians and the \nRepublicans with little to lose. The road to \ngetting rid of nukes is a long one. Let the \nnext guy (or gal) worry about it. \nA Little Leg on Palestine? \nObama hasn't mentioned the Israeli-\nPalestinian conflict in a SOTU speech since \n2009. And that's no coincidence. His own \npoorly thought-through initial effort \ncrashed and burned, leaving the president \npretty frustrated and annoyed with both \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025048 \nIsraelis and Palestinians, particularly Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \nBut hey, that was then. A second-term \npresident has committed himself early in \n2013 to a trip to Israel and has an Energizer \nbunny in Secretary of State John Kerry, \nwho wants to do the right thing and keep \nthe two-state solution alive. Obama clearly \nkept his distance from the issue again on \nTuesday night. He spoke of standing with \nIsrael to pursue peace, but didn't mention \nPalestinians or the peace process. He \nmentioned his own trip to the Middle East, \nbut missed an opportunity to give what \nmight be a trip to the region by his new \nsecretary of state higher profile. It's just as \nwell. The paradox of the Israeli-Palestinian \nissue is that it's too complicated to \nimplement right now and too important to \nabandon. It's in this space that Obama will \nbe forced to operate. And while the odds of \nsuccess are low, Obama will be tempted in \nhis final term to do something bold, \nperhaps laying out a U.S. plan of \nparameters on the key final-status issues. \nIt's the Middle Class, Not the Middle East \nSpoiler alert: Barack Obama might still be \na consequential foreign-policy president if \nhe's lucky, willful, and skillful. But it's his \ndomestic legacy that will make or break his \npresidency. Health care -- his signature \nlegacy issue -- will look much better if the \neconomy improves, driven by a revived \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025049 \nhousing market and rising employment, \nand of course if some broader deal can be \nstruck on entitlements and taxes. \nImmigration reform and gun-control \nlegislation driven by a functional \nbipartisanship would cement that legacy. \nHe'd be an historic rather than a great \npresident. \nTwo clocks tick down in a president's \nsecond term: the drive for legacy and the \nreality of lame duckery. Obama's political \ncapital will diminish quickly. Where, how, \nand on what he wants to spend it is critical. \nThe Middle East is violent and volatile and \nmay yet suck him in, but if he can avoid it, \nhe'll try. This was a State of the Union \naddress that stressed fixing America's \nbroken house, not chasing around the world \ntrying to fix everyone else's. The future of \nAmerica isn't Cairo or Damascus; it's \nChicago and Detroit. \nAaron David Miller is a distinguished \nscholar at the Woodrow Wilson \nInternational Center for Scholars. \nArticle 3. \nAgence Global \nCan the United States  \nStrike a Deal with Iran?  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025050 \nPatrick Seale \n12 Feb 2013 -- Negotiations with Iran are \nonce more on the international agenda. \nAfter an eight-month break, the five \npermanent members of the UN Security \nCouncil plus Germany -- the so-called \nP5+1 -- are due to hold a meeting with Iran \non 25 February in Kazakhstan. What are \nthe prospects of success? In a nutshell, that \nwould seem to depend more on the climate \nin Washington than in Tehran. Iran is \ngesturing that it wants to negotiate, but \nWashington has not yet signalled any \ngreater flexibility than in the past. \nIn a major speech in Tehran last Sunday, \nPresident Mahmoud Ahmadinejad \naddressed the United States: \"Take your \nguns out of the face of the Iranian nation \nand I myself will negotiate with you,\" he \ndeclared. Meanwhile, the Iranian \nambassador to Paris told French officials \nthat, provided a work plan was agreed, Iran \nwas ready to allow inspectors of the \nInternational Atomic Energy Agency \n(IAEA) to visit Parchin, a military facility \nwhere Iran is suspected of having done \nwork on atomic weapons. Ahmadinejad \nhimself has said repeatedly that Iran was \nready to stop enriching uranium to 20% if \nthe international community agreed to \nsupply it instead to the Tehran research \nreactor for the production of isotopes \nneeded to treat cancer patients. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025051 \nThe only recent encouraging word from the \nUnited States was a hint by Vice-President \nJoe Biden at last week's Munich security \nconference that the time may have come \nfor bilateral U.S.-Iranian talks. Iran's \nForeign Minister Ali Akbar Salehi \nresponded positively to Biden's offer, \nalthough he added that Iran would look for \nevidence that Biden's offer was 'authentic' \nand not 'devious'. \nThe road to a U.S.-Iranian agreement is \nlittered with obstacles -- grave mutual \ndistrust being one of them. There is little \noptimism among experts that a \nbreakthrough is imminent. For one thing, \nIran is almost certain to want to defer any \nmajor strategic decision until a new \nPresident is elected next June to replace the \nsharp-tongued Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. To \nstrike a deal with Iran, the United States \nwould also need to assure its Arab allies in \nthe Gulf that they would not fall under \nIranian hegemony or lose American \nprotection. Guarantees would no doubt \nhave to be given. \nIsrael, America's close ally, poses a more \nsubstantial obstacle. It is totally opposed to \nany deal which would allow Iran to enrich \nuranium, even at the low level of 3.5%. \nWanting no challenge to its own \nformidable nuclear arsenal, Israel's long-\nstanding aim has been to halt Iran's nuclear \nprogramme altogether. To this end it has \nassassinated several Iranian nuclear \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025052 \nscientists and joined the United States in \nwaging cyber warfare against Iranian \nnuclear facilities. Its belligerent prime \nminister, Binyamin Netanyahu, has for \nyears been pressing Obama to destroy \nIran's nuclear programme and -- better still \n-- bring down the Islamic regime \naltogether. \nFaced with these obstacles, it is clear that \nany U.S. deal with Iran would require \ncareful preparation. Obama would need to \nmobilize strong domestic support if he is to \nconfront America's vast array of pro-Israeli \nforces. They include Congressmen eager to \ndefend Israeli interests at all costs (as was \nvividly illustrated by the recent Chuck \nHagel confirmation hearings), powerful \nlobbies such as AIPAC, media barons, \nhigh-profile Jewish financiers like Sheldon \nAdelson, a phalanx of neo-con strategists in \nright-wing think tanks, influential pro-\nIsraelis within the Administration, and \nmany, many others. The cost in political \ncapital of challenging them could be very \nsubstantial. Nevertheless, elected for a \nsecond term, he now has greater freedom \nand authority than before. \nObama is due to visit Israel on March 20-\n21, something he did not do in his first \nterm. This visit will be the first foreign trip \nof his second term -- in itself a sign of its \nimportance. Although the White House is \nanxious to play down suggestions that he \nwill announce a major initiative, either on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025053 \nthe Israeli-Palestinian conflict or on Iran, \nthere are issues he cannot avoid. He may, \nhowever, choose to raise them in private \ntalks with Israeli leaders rather than in \npublic. His message is expected to be \ntwofold: Israel should not delay in granting \nstatehood to the Palestinians, however \npainful that choice may be, and it should be \ncareful not to make an eternal enemy of \nIran. Both conflicts have the potential to \nisolate Israel internationally and threaten its \nlong-term interests, if not its actual \nexistence. \nIn his first term of office, Obama resisted \nNetanyahu's pressure to wage war on Iran. \nThis was no more than a semi-success, \nhowever, since he managed to blunt \nNetanyahu's belligerence only by imposing \non Iran a raft of sanctions of unprecedented \nseverity. They have halved Iran's oil \nexports, caused its currency to plummet \nand inflation to gallop, severed its relations \nwith the world's banks and inflicted severe \nhardship on its population. \nThe key question today is this: What are \nObama's intentions? Is he seeking to bring \ndown Iran's Islamic regime, as Israel \nwould like, or is he simply seeking to limit \nits nuclear ambitions? If 'regime change' is \nhis aim then sanctions will have to be \ntightened even further and extended \nindefinitely. But if Obama's aim is to strike \na deal with Iran over its nuclear programme \nthen he must give it at least some of what it \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025054 \nwants: such as sanctions relief; acceptance \nof its right under the Nuclear Non-\nProliferation Treaty to enrich uranium to a \nlow level for peaceful purposes; \nrecognition of its security interests, of the \nlegitimacy of its Islamic regime born out of \nthe 1979 revolution, and of its place in the \nregion as a major power. \nThe P5+1, which are due to meet Iran later \nthis month, remain so divided that they are \nunlikely to improve substantially on their \nprevious miserly offer, which was to \nprovide Iran with some airplane spare parts \nif it gave up uranium enrichment to 20% --\nits trump card. It is the paralysis of Iran's \ndealings with the P5+1 that has lent \ncredence to the idea that the best hope of a \nbreakthrough may lie in bilateral U.S.-\nIranian talks -- perhaps even a summit \nmeeting between President Obama and \nAyatollah Khomeini. \nFor such a summit to be successful the \nUnited States would have to change its \napproach. Iran's supreme leader has made \nclear that Iran will not negotiate under \nthreat of attack. There would have to be \ngive and take. Above all, Iran wants to be \ntreated with respect. This is the challenge \nfacing Obama. \nIt is worth remembering that there is as yet \nno evidence whatsoever that Iran has \ndecided to build nuclear weapons. Nor has \nit developed a reliable delivery system. \nInstead, it has focussed its efforts on \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025055 \nmedium-range missiles unable to reach \nIsrael. It has no second strike capability. As \nPresident Ahmadinejad stressed during his \nvisit to Cairo last week, Iran has no \nintention of attacking Israel. Its posture is \npurely defensive. \nIf Obama were to act with boldness and \nvision, he could defuse a nagging problem \nwhich has plagued the region for years. It is \nsurely time for the United States to draw \nIran into the regional community of nations \nand put an end to 34 years of unremitting \nhostility. \nPatrick Seale is a leading British writer on \nthe Middle East. His latest book is The \nStruggle for Arab Independence: Riad el-\nSolh and the Makers of the Modern Middle \nEast (Cambridge University Press). \nArticle 4. \nThe Washington Post \nWhat path now for Syria?  \nDavid Ignatius  \nFebruary 12, 2013 -- Syrian opposition \nfighters appear to be making significant  \ngains on the battlefield this week, \nfollowing an offer by their top political \nleader for negotiations with the regime of \nPresident Bashar al-Assad. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025056 \nThis military and diplomatic news may \nappear positive. But Syrian sources caution \nthat the battlefield advances may accelerate \nmovement toward a breakup of the country, \nas Alawite supporters of the regime retreat \nto their ancestral homeland in the \nnorthwestern region around Latakia. And \nthere's no sign that either Assad or his \nRussian patrons are paying any more than \nlip service to a political settlement. \nOne potential game-changer is a request for \nU.S. help in training elite rebel units, which \nhas been drafted by Brig. Gen. Salim Idriss, \nthe new commander of the opposition Free \nSyrian Army. In a letter dated Feb. 4, he \nseeks U.S. assistance in \"training for: (1) \nspecial operations; (2) international \nhumanitarian law; and (3) ... in chemical \nweapons security.\" \nIdriss requested various supplies for these \nelite units, including: \"(1) combat armor; \n(2) night vision goggles; (3) hand held \nmonocular and longer range spotting \nequipment; (4) strategic communications; \n(5) winterization packs; and (6) tactical \ncommunications.\" \nThis request for assistance was made just \nafter the Assad regime had rebuffed an \noffer by Sheik Ahmad Moaz al-Khatib, the \nhead of a new opposition coalition, to \nnegotiate with government representatives. \nThe rebels' recent military successes have \ncome mostly in northern Syria; the attacks \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025057 \nwere made by different battalions that \nappear to operate with little central \ncommand and control. The gains include: \n*The al-Jarrah air base, about 30 miles east \nof Aleppo, which appears to have been \noverrun by fighters from Ahrar al-Sham, a \nbattalion based in Idlib. Videos posted \nTuesday by the rebels showed them \nwalking past derelict Syrian warplanes and \ninside a fortified hangar containing what \nappeared to be two Czech-built ground \nassault planes. On camera, the rebels \ndisplayed dozens of bombs racked in a \nwarehouse, and other ammunition and \nspoils of war. \n*The Thawra hydroelectric dam on the \nEuphrates, which is one of Syria's biggest \npower-generating facilities. Rebel sources \nsaid the Syrian army gave up the strategic \ndam after army positions there were \noverrun. The rebels negotiated a surrender \nwith regime loyalists who remained. These \nsources said the dam continues to operate \nand provide power — a positive sign for \nthose who worry that Syria's infrastructure \nwould collapse if the rebels took over. \n*The Aleppo International Airport, \nsoutheast of the city, is close to falling. \nFree Syrian Army sources said Tuesday \nthat their fighters, including allies in the \nextremist al-Nusra Front, had captured an \naccess point near the airport known as \n\"Liwa 80.\" Syrian sources said rebels there \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025058 \nhad seized large amounts of ammunition, \nincluding some shoulder-fired anti-aircraft \nmissiles. \n*Damascus and its suburbs, where the \nrebels are tightening their squeeze on \naccess points to the capital. Syrian sources \nsaid fighters are converging on Damascus \nfrom different parts of the country, \nexpecting a decisive battle there soon. \n\"Regime forces are suffering from very low \nmorale, whereas FSA soldiers have been \nencouraged by recent positive \ndevelopments,\" asserts one FSA report \nfrom Damascus. \nThe al-Nusra Front has been a catalyst and \nbeneficiary of the rebels' success. \nAccording to Syrian sources, al-Nusra is \ngaining strength in Homs, a city in central \nSyria where the group was never strong. \nOne Syrian source told the State \nDepartment: \"They have money, they are \nhelping people with everything including \ndaily living supplies. I heard that some \nfighters are leaving their [former] brigades \nand joining [Al-Nusra], some of them \nselling their weapons to feed their \nfamilies.\" \nOne Syrian who works closely with the \nFree Syrian Army explained how creating \nan elite commando force could help check \nSyria's drift toward becoming a failed \nstate: \"We still believe FSA on the ground \nis still needed badly to tip the power and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025059 \nsupport other parallel solutions, including \nthe political one. But FSA [has] become a \njungle. ... My recommendation is ... to \nstart working on elite [forces that can] ... \ninitiate key attacks plus help as a buffer \nfrom potential warlords and fights among \nfragmented FSA factions. Plus, this unit \ncan handle other key tasks, like securing \nchemical weapons.\" \nThis Syrian strategist argues in another \nmemo that the rebels must \"speak to the \nsilent majority, many who did not care \nabout the revolution, and they want their \nlife back.\" He said that such a negotiated \nsettlement requires more pressure on the \nUnited States, Russia and the United \nNations \"to find a way out of the \ndeadlock.\" \nArticle 5 \nForeign Policy \nWhy Does Europe  \nPretend Hezbollah Has a  \nGood Side?  \nMatthew Levitt \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025060 \nFebruary 12, 2013 -- Bulgaria's interior \nminister announced on Feb. 5 the result of \nhis country's investigation into the July \n2012 bombing of a bus filled with Israeli \ntourists in the city of Burgas, which killed \nfive Israelis and the vehicle's Bulgarian \ndriver. Two of the individuals who carried \nout the terrorist attack, he said, \"belonged \nto the military formation of Hezbollah.\" \nIt was not by chance that his statement \nfingered only the military wing of \nHezbollah, not the group as a whole. \nWithin the European Union, the findings of \nthe Bulgarian investigation have kicked off \na firestorm over whether to add the \nLebanese militant organization -- in whole, \nor perhaps just its military or terrorist \nwings -- to the EU's list of banned terrorist \ngroups. But are there in fact distinct wings \nwithin the self-styled \"Party of God\"? \nHezbollah is many things. It is one of the \ndominant political parties in Lebanon, as \nwell as a social and religious movement \ncatering first and foremost -- though not \nexclusively -- to Lebanon's Shiite \ncommunity. Hezbollah is also Lebanon's \nlargest militia, the only one to keep its \nweapons and rebrand its armed elements as \nan \"Islamic resistance\" in response to the \nterms of the 1989 Taif Accord, which \nended the Lebanese Civil War. \nWhile the group's various elements are \nintended to complement one another, the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025061 \nreality is often messier. In part, that has to \ndo with compartmentalization of \nHezbollah's covert activities. It is also, \nhowever, a result of the group's multiple \nidentities -- Lebanese, pan-Shiite, pro-\nIranian -- and the group's multiple and \nsometimes competing goals tied to these \ndifferent identities. \nHezbollah's ideological commitment to \nIranian Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's \nrevolutionary doctrine of velayat-e \nfaqih (guardianship of the jurist), which \nholds that a Shiite Islamic cleric should \nserve as the supreme head of government, \nis a key source of conflict. The group is \nthus simultaneously committed to the \ndecrees of Iranian clerics, the Lebanese \nstate, its sectarian Shiite community within \nLebanon, and fellow Shiites abroad. \nThe consequences of these competing \nideological drivers was clear in July 2006, \nwhen Hezbollah dragged Israel and \nLebanon into a war neither state wanted by \ncrossing the U.N.-demarcated border \nbetween the two countries, killing three \nIsraeli soldiers, and kidnapping two more \nin an ambush. They came to the fore again \ntwo years later, when Hezbollah took over \nWest Beirut by force of arms, turning its \nweapons of \"resistance\" against fellow \nLebanese citizens. When the chips are \ndown, Hezbollah's commitment to Iran \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025062 \ntrumps its identity as a Lebanese political \nmovement. \nThe ties that bind Hezbollah's political \nleadership with its international illicit \nactivities are also unmistakable. According \nto a CIA document, even before Hassan \nNasrallah rose to the position of secretary-\ngeneral in 1992, he was \"directly involved \nin many Hizballah terrorist operations, \nincluding hostage taking, airline hijackings, \nand attacks against Lebanese rivals.\" \nTime and again, Hezbollah's political \npersonalities have been tied to the group's \nterrorist and criminal activities. Consider a \nmajor case in the United States: In 2008, \nwhile Hezbollah operative Ali Karaki was \nplanning a Hezbollah attack in Azerbaijan's \ncapital, Baku, his brother, Hasan Antar \nKaraki, was helping lead a broad criminal \nconspiracy to sell counterfeit and stolen \ncurrency in Philadelphia. Luckily, Hasan \nAntar Karaki sold his wares to an \nundercover FBI informant posing as a \nmember of the Philadelphia criminal \nunderworld. Hasan Antar Karaki proved to \nbe a major figure in Hezbollah's forgery \noperations, and he provided an FBI source \nwith fraudulent British and Canadian \npassports. \nMeanwhile, in meetings in Lebanon and \nthe United States, Hasan Antar Karaki's \nassociate, Hassan Hodroj, a Hezbollah \nspokesman and the head of its Palestinian \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025063 \nissues portfolio within the group's political \nechelon, sought to procure a long list of \nsophisticated weapons in a black-market \nscheme involving Hezbollah operatives \nacross the globe. According to court \ndocuments, Hodroj wanted \"heavy \nmachinery\" for the \"fight against Jews and \nto protect Lebanon.\" But move forward \nwith caution, Hodroj counseled an \nundercover FBI source, because someone \nin the United States could \"go to jail for \n100 years\" if caught dealing with \nHezbollah. \nIn light of cases like this one, in which \npeople overtly affiliated with Hezbollah's \npolitical activities are engaged in criminal \nand terrorist activities, it becomes \nincreasingly difficult to separate \nHezbollah's overt activities from its covert \nbehavior. \"Little is known about [the \nHezbollah military wing's] internal \ncommand hierarchy,\" a Western \ngovernment report noted in 2012, \"due to \nits highly secretive nature and use of \nsophisticated protective measures.\" \nThe structure and manpower of Hezbollah's \nterrorist operation, which is responsible for \nits financial and logistical activities as well \nas its terrorist operations abroad, are \nsimilarly opaque. We do know, however, \nthat Hezbollah's terrorist network, the \nIslamic Jihad Organization (IJO), was \nformally founded in 1983 when Hezbollah \nmaster terrorist Imad Mughniyeh fled to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025064 \nIran after orchestrating the October 1983 \nbombing of the U.S. Marine Corps and \nFrench military barracks in Beirut with his \nbrother-in-law, Mustafa Badreddine. \nThis much is clear: Since its founding, \nHezbollah has developed a sophisticated \norganizational and leadership structure. \nThe overall governing authority, the Majlis \nal-Shura (Consultative Council), wields all \ndecision-making power and directs several \nsubordinate functional councils. Each \nfunctional council reports directly to the \nMajlis al-Shura, which, as Hezbollah \nDeputy Secretary-General Naim Qassem \nwrote in his book, is \"in charge of drawing \nthe overall vision and policies, overseeing \nthe general strategies for the party's \nfunction, and taking political decisions.\" \nU.S. assessments echo Qassem's \ndescription. \"Hezbollah has a unified \nleadership structure that oversees the \norganization's complementary, partially \ncompartmentalized elements,\" reads a \nCongressional Research Service report. \nThe secretary-general, currently Nasrallah, \npresides over the Majlis al-Shura and \nfunctions as the group's leader under the \nauthority of the \"jurist theologian\" \nAyatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's supreme \nleader. Five administrative bodies, \norganized around thematic responsibilities, \nrun Hezbollah's political, military (jihad), \nparliamentary, executive, and judicial \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025065 \nactivities. The Majlis al-Shura considers all \nelements of the group's activities, including \nits political and military wings, as part of \none holistic entity. \nAccording to Hezbollah's top officials, this \nunity of purpose among the group's diverse \nactivities is essential to its success. \"If the \nmilitary wing were separated from the \npolitical wing, this would have \nrepercussions, and it would reflect on the \npolitical scene,\" Qassem told a Lebanese \npaper in 2000. \"Hezbollah's secretary-\ngeneral is the head of the Shura Council \nand also the head of the Jihad Council, and \nthis means that we have one leadership, \nwith one administration.\" \nThe Jihad Council is the functional council \nunderneath the Majlis al-Shura responsible \nfor all military matters. Qassem writes that \nit \"comprises those in charge of resistance \nactivity, be that in terms of oversight, \nrecruitment, training, equipment, security, \nor any other resistance-related endeavors.\" \nTo accomplish its mission, the council is \ndivided into several smaller units in charge \nof protecting the leadership and carrying \nout internal and external surveillance, as \nwell as overseas operations. The party's \nsecurity branch is further broken down into \nthree subgroups: central, preventive, and \noverseas security. In 2000, a dedicated \ncounterintelligence branch was reportedly  \nfounded as well. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025066 \nUnder this structure, Hezbollah's militia \nand terrorist activities, along with its \nsecurity organ, all report to the Jihad \nCouncil. Until he was killed, Mughniyeh \nwas Hezbollah's top militant commander \nand reportedly led the Jihad Council \nhimself By some accounts, he also held a \nseat on the Majlis al-Shura, which would \nbe typical for the party's standing military \ncommander. \nUnlike its sister councils, however, the \nJihad Council enjoys strategic ambiguity. \nNeither the majority of Hezbollah officials \nnor the party's elected parliamentarians are \naware of the details of their party's covert \nmilitary and terrorist activities, which are \ndecided on by the most senior leadership. \nAccording to the U.S. government, these \nactivities are \"executed\" by the leadership \nof Hezbollah's military apparatus, known \nas the Islamic Resistance and led by \nBadreddine, and by the IJO, led by Talal \nHamiyah, and they are \"overseen\" by \nNasrallah. \nEurope's approach to Hezbollah has been \nvaried. Many European governments have \nresisted international efforts to designate \nthe organization as a terrorist group by \ndistinguishing between Hezbollah's \npolitical and military wings. Britain \ndistinguishes among Hezbollah's terrorist \nwing (the Islamic Jihad Organization), \nmilitary wing, and political wing, and the \ncountry banned the IJO in 2000 and the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025067 \nmilitary wing in 2008. The Netherlands, \nhowever, designated Hezbollah a terrorist \nentity in 2004 without distinguishing \nbetween the group's political and military \nwings. A 2004 Dutch intelligence report \nhighlighted investigations that show \n\"Hezbollah's political and terrorist wings \nare controlled by one co-ordinating \ncouncil.\" \nThe European Union has taken action \nagainst Hezbollah's interests in the past. In \nMay 2002, the European Union froze the \nassets of a non-European terrorist group for \nthe first time by adding seven Hezbollah-\naffiliated individuals, including \nMughniyeh, to its financial sanctions list \nfor terrorism. It did not, however, sanction \nHezbollah as an organization. On March \n10, 2005, the European Parliament passed a \nnonbinding resolution recognizing that \n\"clear evidence exists of terrorist activities \non the part of Hezbollah\" and calling on the \nEuropean Council to take \"all necessary \nsteps to curtail them.\" \nBut the necessary steps did not occur. \nInstead, most European countries preferred \nto make convenient distinctions between \nthe different parts of Hezbollah, even when \nthe group's own leadership does not. \nToday, as European leaders consider \nwhether to label Hezbollah a terrorist \ngroup, they should judge the group by the \ntotality of its actions. Hezbollah cannot be \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025068 \nforgiven its criminal, terrorist, or militant \npursuits simply because it also engages in \npolitical or humanitarian ones. As the \nBurgas bus bombing demonstrates, the \nParty of God can and has mobilized \noperatives for everything from criminal \nenterprises to terrorist attacks well beyond \nLebanon's borders. \nAnd though Hezbollah is composed of \nmultiple committees and branches, it \noperates as a single entity. Hezbollah, the \nU.S. intelligence community has \ndetermined, is \"a multifaceted, disciplined \norganization that combines political, social, \nparamilitary, and terrorist elements\" and is \none in which decisions \"to resort to arms or \nterrorist tactics [are] carefully calibrated.\" \nHezbollah's Qassem, speaking in October \n2012, concurred: \"We don't have a military \nwing and a political one; we don't have \nHezbollah on one hand and the resistance \nparty on the other.... Every element of \nHezbollah, from commanders to members \nas well as our various capabilities, are in \nthe service of the resistance, and we have \nnothing but the resistance as a priority,\" he \nsaid. \nMaybe it is time Western leaders finally \nlistened to him. \nMatthew Levitt directs the Stein program \non Counterterrorism and Intelligence at the \nWashington Institute for Near East Policy. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025069 \nHe is author of \"Hizballah and the Qods  \nForce in Iran's Shadow War with the West\" \nand the forthcoming book Hezbollah: The \nGlobal Footprint of Lebanon's Party of \nGod. \nArticle 6. \nThe Atlantic \nA Middle-Class Paradise  \nin Palestine?  \nArmin Rosen \nFeb 11 2013 -- The sole outlet to Rawabi  \nsits off a dizzying two-lane highway \nflanked by round, scraggly hills. In this part \nof the West Bank, just north of where the \nJerusalem suburbs thin into a dry, granite-\ngray wilderness, the mountains seem to aid \nin the illusion that Israeli and Palestinian \nspheres of authority can remain perfectly, \neven harmoniously separate. Arabs use the \nroad to get to the Palestinian-controlled \ncities of Bir Zeit and Ramallah, for Jewish \nIsraelis, the road connects the Jerusalem \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025070 \narea to settlements deep inside the northern \nhalf of the West Bank. \nRamallah's skyline is barely discernible on \na hazy day. Ateret, a red-gabled settlement \nof about 90 families that sits high above the \nRawabi junction -- a community which \nwould likely either be vacated or \nincorporated into a Palestinian state under a \nfuture peace agreement -- flickers in and \nout of view with every delirious knot in the \nroad. Even a concrete pillbox looming over \nthe highest point along the highway is \nabandoned, its connection to the territory's \noddly invisible occupying army marked \nonly by a tattered Israeli flag that no one \nhas bothered to steal or replace. \nLast year was the first since 1973 in which \nno Israeli citizen was killed in a terrorist \nattack originating from the West Bank. As \non the newly-pacified Gaza-Israel border, a \ntense quiet pervades things here, although a \nbright red sign at the junction reminds one \ncategory of motorist not to feel too \ncomplacent. \"This road leads to Area 'A' \nUnder the Palestinian Authority,\" it reads \nin Arabic, Hebrew, and broken English. \n\"The entrance for Israeli citizens is \nforbidden, dangerous to your lives and is \nagainst the Israeli law.\" At the Rawabi \njunction these warnings of latent danger are \nalmost comically off-base, partly because \nof the only other marker at the turnoff: a \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025071 \nlight-green arrow sagging off of a nearby \npost. \nNo one lives at the end of the road, which \nis every bit as wavy and disorienting as the \nadjoining highway. It empties into a scene \nthat seems engineered for maximum \nbewilderment: three high-rise cranes, \ntopped with fluttering Palestinian flags, \ntower over massive stone and concrete \nbuilding frames. Cement-mixers, painted \nthe same shade of light green as the arrow \nat the turnoff and marked with the project's \nlogo -- a wiry oval with a cute little convex \nloop at the end, like a child's drawing of a \nheart that could also be a tree -- line up to \nreceive material from a buzzing, state-of-\nthe-art plant. The construction site, a \ncouple turns up-road of the cement factory, \nis swarming with workers in green \nhardhats. Spotless SUVs with the Rawabi \nlogo on the door speed from one side of the \nsite to another. \nRawabi, which will be the first Palestinian \nplanned city in the West Bank, runs from \nthe top of the mountain to the valley below, \nwith its highest point sitting at an elevation \nslightly higher than Ateret, which is now \nconstantly visible. In contrast, the chaos of \nRamallah, stronghold of an insolvent and \nsclerotic Palestinian Authority, feels distant \nin more senses than one. \nRawabi represents something totally new --\na visionary Palestinian-directed private \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025072 \nsector project, with support from both \nIsraeli businesses and a major Arab \ngovernment. It has the potential to shift the \nconversation on the region's future on both \nsides of the Green Line. It could convince \nPalestinians -- and the rest of the world --\nthat the future of the West Bank shouldn't \nbe shackled to Ramallah or Jerusalem's \nvacillating willingness to hash out \nfundamental issues. It could prove that \nthere's an appetite, both among Palestinian \nconsumers and foreign donors, for the \ncreation of a social and economic existence \nin the West Bank that's de-coupled, \ninsomuch as currently possible, from the \nMiddle East's tense and labyrinthine \npolitics. \nIt would also help solidify the benefits of \nthe current cessation in hostilities. Indeed, \nPalestinian leader Mahmoud Abbas's \nprogress in fostering the end of violent \nresistance in the West Bank in the years \nafter the bloody Second Intifada, coupled \nwith Palestinian Prime Minister Salaam \nFayyad's widely-respected institution-\nbuilding initiative, could get a crucial \nprivate sector assist through Rawabi's \neventual success. \nAnd Rawabi gets at something even more \nfundamental. \"It touches upon all of the \ncore issues of control and sovereignty,\" \nsays Robert Danin, a fellow at the Council \non Foreign Relations who, as head of the \nQuartet mission in Jerusalem from 2008 to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025073 \n2010, witnessed some of the political \ndiscussions that accompanied the project's \ncreation. \"This could be a huge, iconic \nvictory for the whole strategy of building \nPalestine from the bottom up rather than \ntrying to build it at the negotiating table,\" \nhe says. \nIts success would prove just how much \npower Palestinians can, and indeed already \ndo, have in shaping their future. And its \nfailure could prove the exact opposite. \nI visited Rawabi two weeks ago with a \ngroup of national security professionals, as \npart of a trip organized by the Foundation \nfor Defense of Democracies, a Washington, \nDC-based think tank. (All of the photos in \nthe body of the article are mine.) We were \ntaken around the construction site by a \nyoung Palestinian engineer who conveyed \nthe vast ambition underlying the project: \nWhen the city is completed, she said, it will \nhouse 45,000 people in 23 distinct \nneighborhoods with innocuous, nature-\nbased names like \"Flint,\" and \"Hard Rock\". \n(Rawabi is Arabic for \"Hills\".) There will \nbe eight schools -- some of them built with \nthe help of the U.S. Agency for \nInternational Development -- a \"huge \npark,\" a convention center, an 850-seat \nindoor theater, and a 20,000-seat \namphitheater carved into a hillside. \nMost ambitiously, there will be a \ncommercial center that developers hope \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025074 \nwill bring in between 3,000 and 5,000 \npermanent jobs within the next five years --\nhopefully, we were told, in the \ninformational technology sector (an \naspiration that might imply a certain \ncooperation with the burgeoning tech \nindustry on the other side of the Green \nLine). The engineer said that Rawabi had \nalready created 3,000 construction jobs for \nWest Bank Palestinians. The city is \nPalestinian-designed and Palestinian-built - \n- making the surfeit of Qatari flags at the \nconstruction site somewhat puzzling at \nfirst. And while the project does not \npurchase materials from Jewish settlements \nin the West Bank, the engineer was hardly \nshy in explaining that Rawabi would add \nan estimated $85 million to the Israeli \neconomy. \nAs we drove around the construction site, \nthe engineer's talk made few demands on \nthe imagination. The sheer scale of the \nproject is already obvious. Within the next \n18 months, the first phase, which includes \nsix neighborhoods, a mosque, the \namphitheater, and two-thirds of the city's \ncommercial center, will be complete, and \n3,000 people are scheduled will move into \nRawabi by the end of 2013. Apartment \nblocks built of a local white stone --\n\"Rawabi stone,\" the engineer called it -- are \nalready rising out of a network of \nconcentric ring-roads centered on the top of \nthe hill. Most of these roads have already \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025075 \nbeen paved, and there are terraced retaining \nwalls, built out of thick stacks of local \nsandstone, running all the way to the \nbottom of the valley. No bleachers have \nbeen installed in the amphitheater yet, but \nit's fairly far along, with the future seating \narea fanning into a wide notch in the \nmountainside. There are attractive stone \nsigns bearing the stylized Arabic names of \nneighborhoods that haven't been built yet. \nThe future commercial center is also well \non its way to completion. Situated on a \nshelf slightly below the summit of the hill, \nthe complex of office buildings, hotels, \ntheaters, and a convention center will \nhuddle around a broad outdoor plaza, \nwhich will be connected to the lower \nneighborhoods through a wide flight of \nstairs. The stairs, plaza, and central \nbuildings are already past their skeletal \nphase, and the high-rise apartments ringing \nthe city center look like they're almost \ncomplete. For now, the commercial core is \na jumble of dust and brutal concrete \nsurfaces, but in the future, someone \nlingering in the cafés near the staircase will \nenjoy phenomenal views of the rugged hill \ncountry, and perhaps even glimpses of the \nJordan River Valley on a clear day. \nIt is still possible to remain unconvinced of \nRawabi's reality -- doubtful as to whether \nthat café will ever be built, or whether any \nmiddle class-Palestinian desirous of a \ngeneric middle class existence will ever \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025076 \nlinger there. There's abundant reason for \nskepticism. The project's future depends on \nthe Israeli authorities' willingness to allow \nfor the construction of access roads in \n\"Area C,\" or West Bank territory under the \ndirect control of Israel. The sole existing \nroute into the city only exists because the \nIsraeli government, after years of \nbureaucratic and high-level diplomatic \nwrangling, granted Rawabi's developers a \npermit for a \"temporary\" road. Technically, \nthey will have to destroy the road when the \ncurrent permission expires. And even if the \nIsraelis agree to make the road permanent, \none two-lane route is hardly adequate for a \ncity of 45,000 people. Developers claim it \nisn't even adequate to the needs of the \ncurrent construction site. \nWater is another challenge. Negotiations \nwith Israel and the Palestinian Water \nAuthority are ongoing, and developers say \nthey have held in excess of 100 meetings \nwith Israeli officials on water-related issues \nalone. Developers admit that they aren't \nsure where the city's water resources will \neventually come from, and the construction \nsite only got running water two months \nago. \nAnd they'll admit that attracting jobs to the \nsite is an even bigger challenge than Israel's \nWest Bank regime. Rawabi isn't meant to \nbe a bedroom community of Ramallah. It's \nmeant to be a self-contained city, with \noffice and retail space. The jobs haven't \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025077 \nquite materialized yet (although the \ndevelopers have a slight head start: \nbetween 200 and 300 call center-type jobs \ncurrently based in Ramallah are scheduled \nto move into Rawabi when the first phase \nof construction is complete). If the political \nor security situation seriously deteriorates - \n- if the checkpoints return, if the Israelis are \nforced to re-occupy urban areas ceded to \nthe Palestinian Authority under the Oslo \nAccords, as happened during the Second \nIntifada; if Hamas wages a violent takeover \nof the Palestinian government -- all bets are \noff The developers don't seem to be \nbothered by those possibilities right now. \nAt the showroom, built at the very top of \nthe hill, the future is nothing but bright. \nI chatted with another site engineer as we \nwalked through a scale-model mock-up of \na typical Rawabian street, where happy \nfamilies in western dress waved from little \nvideo screens inset in plastic apartment \nwindows. I asked her about the Qatari flags \nI had seen around the construction site. \nQatar's state investment fund is footing two \nthirds of the nearly $1 billion project bill, \nshe said. \"This is the biggest investment in \nthe history of Palestine,\" she explained as \nwe stepped over a fake valley in the next \nroom, walking past a mock-up of a \nstunning hilltop view contained inside a \nmock-up of a future apartment suite. The \nRawabians will apparently own large flat-\nscreen TVs and stylish coffee tables, and \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025078 \ntheir living spaces will be kept mercilessly \nclean. \nWhat, of that $1 billion investment, was \ngoing to Israel, I asked? Israeli companies \nwere providing cement powder and sand, \nshe said, and the project had consulted with \n\"Israeli experts.\" \"In some cases, you have \nto do that,\" she said, alluding to the \ncomparative difficulty of importing \nbuilding materials through neighboring \nJordan. In other words, working with the \nIsraelis was a necessary business decision \nfor a project this large and complex. \nThe fake street, fake valley, fake \napartment-display ended in a pleasant sky-\nlit lobby, where representatives of the \nCairo Amman Bank, Arab Islamic Bank, \nand Arab Bank sat in logoed glass cubicles, \navailable to discuss financing for future \npurchases. And for the still-skeptical, \nthere's a six-minute 3-D movie, where the \ncity appears in its completed glory -- a \nplace where families picnic, men in \nbusiness dress greet each other amid \nbustling plazas, and fireworks crest over \nsoaring apartment towers topped with solar \npanels. The architecture is tasteful. These \naren't dachas plunked on fake islands off \nthe coast of Dubai. It's the kind of place \nwhere I, or just about anyone in the world \nwith middle or even upper-middle class \naspirations, would want to live. And it \nlooked weirdly familiar. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025079 \nThe group had a chance to visit with \nBashar Masri, the Nablus-born founder and \nCEO of Massar International, the \nPalestinian conglomerate financing a third \nof Rawabi. Massar and Qatar Diar, the real \nestate investment arm of the government of \nQatar's sovereign wealth fund, jointly \ncreated Bayti Real Estate Investment \nCompany -- Palestine to build and market \nRawabi. But if two-thirds of the project's \nmoney is coming from Qatar, the vision \nbehind Rawabi is Masri's. \nMassar owns a private equity fund that \ninvests in Palestinian agriculture and \nnatural gas distribution. It runs travel \nagencies in Jordan and brokerage firms in \nSerbia. Massar invests in Harvest Export, \nwhich sells Palestinian produce to \nconsumers in Russia and Western Europe --\nas well as in Israel. Two years ago, Masri \nmade headlines when he attempted to  \npurchase a bankrupt Jewish housing \ndevelopment in East Jerusalem. He helped \ncreate an online trading and brokerage \nplatform for Palestine's stock exchange. \nMasri has lived outside of Palestine for \nperiods of his life, and is, by all accounts, \nlargely untainted by connections to the \nPA's notoriously rent-seeking inner circle. \nHe's a trim middle-aged man, smartly-\ndressed, friendly and approachable. There \nseemed no more appropriate a place to talk \nto him one-on-one than on a wide terrace \noverlooking the construction site, with \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025080 \nhills, valleys, and rising apartment blocks --\nthe future he was in the process of building \n-- stretched out in front of him. \n\"On a good, clear day, you can see Tel \nAviv, Ashdod, and Ashkelon,\" he told me. \n\"One-third of Palestine and Israel.\" Rawabi \nis in the second-largest, yet most sparsely-\npopulated Area A in the West Bank -- from \nthe terrace, which faces away from Ateret, \nyou can see expanses of mostly-empty \nhills. Perhaps in Masri's mind, they are \nawaiting Rawabis of their own. When I \nreturned to Washington, I asked him in a \nphone interview if he viewed his project as \nthe first of many such planned cities in \nPalestine. \"I always say our success is \nmeasured not by how many homes we sell. \nIt is measured when a second Rawabi is \nestablished,\" he told me. \nStanding on the terrace, I asked him if his \nwillingness to undertake such a massive \nproject reflected any optimism about the \ncoming years -- no one invests this much \ntime, money, and energy into something if \nthey expect war is on the horizon. \"This \nproject is built for today's politics,\" he \nreplied. \"If it gets a little worse, or a little \nbetter -- fine. If it gets really bad, we're in \ntrouble. If it doesn't, then great. We're not \nwaiting on a breakthrough.\" \nHe estimated that Israeli obstruction had \ndelayed the project by a year and a half \nThe bureaucratic inertia could continue: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025081 \nFor instance, developers were surprised to \nfind out that, by a quirk in the West Bank's \nnotoriously Byzantine and palimpsestic \nlegal codes, they required the approval of a \njoint Israeli-Palestinian water commission \ncreated through the Oslo Accords to build a \nsewage treatment plant in an Area A, \napproval that they recently received. \nThere's also the still-unresolved matter of \nthe access road. But thus far, Rawabi had \nflourished in spite of delays and \ninconveniences. \nCould it survive its isolation, though --\ncould this hilltop off of a two-lane highway \nget enough water and electricity to support \n45,000 people living at a middle class \nstandard? \"There is nothing here at all. \nWe're out in the boondocks,\" he conceded. \n\"We're building everything from scratch.\" \nOne needed only to glance at the busy \nconstruction site below to understand that \nMasri considers this a point of pride, far \nfrom a potential death-sentence for his \nproject. \nI asked Masri about something that had \njumped out at me during the 3-D video. \nThe finished Rawabi, I'd noted, had the \nsame terraced garden parks, stoic, modular \napartment design, and concentric hilltop \nroads that I had seen in Talpiyot Misrach, a \nnew neighborhood on the fringes of West \nJerusalem. His city looked very, well, \nIsraeli. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025082 \n\"This place is influenced by Reston, \nVirginia,\" he said -- Masri is a Virginia \nTech alumnus, and had lived in the \nWashington, DC area earlier in life. It was, \nhe said, influenced by planned suburbs \noutside of Cairo. \"And it's influenced by \nModi'in,\" he added, explaining that the \nsite's engineers and designers (who were \nentirely Palestinian, we had been told \nearlier), had traveled to the Israeli city, \nwhich is built around similar topography, \nfor inspiration. \nPalestinians have long understood that a \nwestern-style standard of living was \npossible in their part of the world. They \nknew that places like Rawabi already \nexisted minutes from their own homes, but \ndidn't think that the quality of life \nepitomized by hilltop settlements and cities \nin Israel -- places they weren't allowed to \nvisit without an official permit from the \nmilitary -- was accessible to them. \nDuring our phone interview, Masri talked \nabout the astonishment that Palestinians \nfeel when they visit the construction site. \n\"When [Palestinians] come to Rawabi, and \nthey go through the showroom and they see \nwhat we have planned for them, and they \nsee it actually being built, they say, 'Wow, \nthis can't be for us. This is not for us. This \nis too high of a standard for us because we \nare supposed to live miserably under the \noccupation'. Then they come to the other \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025083 \nside of the showroom and see the city being \nbuilt, and reality starts sinking in.\" \nIt's a type of living closely associated with \nthe Palestinians' neighbors in Israel. \"They \nknow very well that just a 20-minute drive \naway, there's a community with a much \nhigher standard of living. And that \ncommunity happened to be one \nrepresenting the occupier, quote-unquote \nthe 'enemy.' But they would love to live \nlike that. And that's why when they come \nto Rawabi some of them don't believe this \nis for them initially. The first thing that \ngoes through their mind is that this could \nbe for the Israelis.\" \nBut it is for them. Rawabi's significance \ncould lie in something more mundane than \nbasic issues of sovereignty and control in \nthe West Bank. It lies in the common, \nhuman desire -- powerful on either side of \nthe Green Line -- for a comfortable and \ndignified existence. \nIn some quarters, this idea of working \nwithin the present and less-than-ideal \npolitical and economic framework to \nachieve this goal is nothing short of \ninflammatory. The U.S.-based, anti-peace \nprocess website Electronic Intifada has \nsmeared Masri as an Israeli collaborator, \nand there have been scattered accusations \nthat the project actually legitimizes Israeli \ncontrol over the West Bank. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025084 \nDanin says that Masri is faced with a \ndifficult balancing act. \"On the one hand \nyou're denying the occupation, and you're \nsaying you do not accept its legitimacy,\" he \nsays. \"But that doesn't mean you won't \nwork with Israel in order to improve the \nPalestinian situation with the goal of \nremoving the occupation. That's a difficult \nmessage to convey successfully.\" \nMasri rejects the notion that he abetting a \nproblematic status quo. \"The vast majority \nof Palestinians understand and know \nreality,\" he said. \"There is no home in \nPalestine without Israeli cement and parts. \nEvery construction project in Palestine \nmust have components from Israel. So it's \nnot like I'm doing something different.\" \nOf course, he doesn't like that Israel has so \nmuch control over Palestinian imports, and \nthe West Bank economy in general. \"This \nis the occupation,\" he said. \"I'm not happy \nabout that and that's why we strive for a \nstate of our own.\" But he likened \nboycotting Israeli products to boycotting \nproducts from the United Kingdom, the \nUnited States, or other countries supportive \nof Israel -- something he wouldn't consider. \nThe only people he won't buy from are the \nWest Bank settlers. \nLuckily, Masri's vision has the backing of a \npowerful regional government -- one that \ndoes not officially recognize Israel, and \nwhose actions have often had the effect of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025085 \nstrengthening some of the Jewish State's \nsworn enemies. \nThe Gulf kingdom of Qatar has done more \nthan simply buy into the Rawabi paradigm: \nIt's also funding two-thirds of the project, \nto the tune of over $600 million. This is \nenough money to single-handedly finance \nthe Fatah-dominated Palestinian Authority \n-- which is effectively broke, thanks to \npenalties imposed by the Israeli and U.S. \ngovernments after Mahmoud Abbas's \nsuccessful push for a U.N. General \nAssembly vote on Palestinian U.N. \nmembership, and a freeze in financial aid \nfrom Gulf State donors, most notably Saudi \nArabia -- for the better part of a year. \nInstead, the Qataris have not only bypassed \nthe PA, but channeled money into a project \nthat seems to prove the PA's uselessness. \n\"It's like an island inside the traditional \ninfrastructure of the PA,\" says Jonathan \nSchanzer, vice president of research at the \nFoundation for Defense of Democracies \nand author of a book on Palestinian internal \npolitics. \"It shows everyone what you can \ndo if you don't go through the PA. The PA \nreceives $600 million a year [in foreign \naid] and they have not done something like \nthis.\" \nMasri says that the leadership of the PA has \nbeen fully supportive, but that Rawabi has \nbeen hurt by the Palestinian government's \nlack of capacity. \"We should not be \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025086 \nbuilding public schools. We should not be \nbuilding a waste water treatment plant or \nwaste water networks or water reservoirs,\" \nhe told me. \"Unfortunately we have to do \nthat because the Palestinian Authority does \nnot have the funding and the donors let [the \nPA] down.\" \nThere might be a political calculation \nbehind Qatar's decision to throw an amount \nof money equivalent to two years of U.S.  \nfinancial aid to the PA behind a single \nprivate-sector figure like Masri. Qatar \nrecently announced plans to invest nearly  \n$400 million in the Hamas-controlled Gaza \nStrip, and in October of 2012, Qatari Emir \nSheikh Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani \nbecame the first head of state to visit the  \nStrip  after the Islamist militant group's \n2007 takeover. Hamas politburo chief \nKhaled Meshaal lives in Doha, and Qatar \nDiar is financing a major development in  \nSudan, whose cash-strapped government \nenjoys close relations with Iran, and has \nfacilitated the transfer of long-range \nrockets to Hamas. In short, Qatar supports \nan E.U. and U.S. listed terrorist \norganization bitterly opposed to both Israel \nand the current PA leadership. And it also \nhas no problem investing in Rawabi. \nAccording to Kamran Bokhari, vice \npresident of Middle Eastern and South \nAsian affairs for Stratfor, Qatari support for \nHamas is part of the sheikhdom's larger, \npost-Arab Spring strategy of siding with \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025087 \nthe Middle East's Islamists, and specifically \nthe Muslim brotherhood, whom the Qataris \nview as the region's rising power. \"The \nQatari strategy is that the situation has \nchanged, and we need to fend for ourselves \nand ensure that the regional anarchy is not \ngoing to impact us,\" says Bokhari. The \nQatari investment in Rawabi -- which feeds \nan $85 million investment in the Israeli \neconomy, and which could not have \nhappened without some degree of official \nIsraeli approval -- is an example of this \nlarger geopolitical strategy, which is driven \nmore by perceived self-interest than by an \nideological affinity for political Islam. \n\"Investments in the region are about the \nreturn on political influence,\" adds Gregory \nGause, a professor at the University of \nVermont and a non-resident senior fellow \nat the Brookings Institution-Doha. He \nnoted the presence of a large American \nairbase in Qatar, and the country's close \nrelations with the United States. \nIn the Palestinian territories, as in the \nbroader region, the Qataris are supporting \nsecular and religious forces in a way that \nwill maximize their influence and keep the \nregional balance as favorable for them as \npossible. In a sense, the same strategic \ncalculus that convinces Qatar to support \nHamas allows them to cooperate with Israel \nand the West Bank private sector as well. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025088 \n\"I think Qatar is going by the ground \nreality,\" says Bokhari. \"Fatah, the ruling \nfaction of the PA, is essentially tanking. It's \nreally in a state of decline because of \ncorruption and charges of embezzlement. \nIt's got an aging leadership. There's no \ndynamism left in the group. There's a lot of \nfactionalism. It's almost like an oligarchy.\" \nRawabi could be Qatar's way of \nencouraging the currently-calm status quo \nin the West Bank, but without obviously \nupgrading their ties to Israel, or throwing \ntheir money behind a political \nestablishment that they don't fully trust. \n\"On one end they need to make sure Fatah \ndoes not completely collapse or weaken to \nthe point where they're no longer coherent,\" \nsays Bokhari, \"and Hamas needs to be \nshaped and contained and shepherded in a \nway that it doesn't grow into anything \nlarger.\" \nThough there are politics underlying \nQatar's investment in Rawabi, it is still, \ninevitably, a financial decision. \"You have \nserious people who have a lot at risk here,\" \nDanin says. \"Their goal is not primarily to \nmake a political point. Their goal is to \nrecoup their investment and make some \nmoney.\" Even resource-rich Qatar, which \nwants to diversity its holdings in order to \nhedge against long-term shifts in the oil \nand natural gas market, cares whether its \ninvestment choices pay off \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025089 \nDanin believes that Rawabi's Palestinian \nand Qatari investors made a wise decision. \nHousing in Ramallah is expensive, and \nDanin says that there is a sizable and \nhighly-educated Palestinian middle class in \nneed of an alternative to the West Bank's \nde-facto capital. He expressed little doubt \nwhen I asked him if the West Bank \neconomy could support Rawabi. \"This is a \nPalestinian national project,\" he said. \"It is \nthe best of what is possible in that it's \nprivate sector-led, and it's profit-making \nled.\" \nAnd it has supporters in high places. When \nPresident Barack Obama met with Israeli \nofficials in Washington in September of \n2010, Rawabi was on the agenda. \nFrom one perspective, Rawabi is a historic \ninvestment in Palestine, as well as an \nunusually open point of cooperation \nbetween Israel and an Arab government. It \ncould improve the lives of Palestinians, \nwhile convincing Israelis that they have \nnothing to fear from their neighbors' \nprosperity. But any attempts to change \nthe status quo in the West Bank are fraught \nwith difficulties. \nThere's Israeli bureaucracy to overcome. \n\"In Israel, if the Minister of Defense says I \nwant something, it's not that the system \nthwarts it. But the system is so \ndecentralized that ultimately it takes a lot \nof steps to get it translated into action,\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025090 \nsays Danin. Israeli officials are positively \ndisposed towards Rawabi, but it's still taken \nyears to resolve sovereignty and \ngovernance issues around necessities like \nwater, and a single access road. Such \nIsraeli inertia was apparently at the heart of \nObama's concerns back in 2010, and \nsources say that the president has discussed \nthe issue of the access road with Israeli \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on \nmultiple occasions. \nBack in Washington, I asked Masri if he \nbelieved the Israelis understood the \npotential importance of Rawabi. \"I really \ndon't know,\" he said. \"Their statements are \nneutral to positive. But their actions are \nneutral to negative.\" \nAnd then there's the larger inertia. What \nmeaning does a place like Rawabi have if it \nsits in the middle of a still-unresolved \nconflict, or if Palestinian economic self-\nimprovement stands in contrast to an all-\npervading political stasis -- or even \npolitical backsliding? Today, Rawabi is \nsignificant because of its novelty. But if \nthere's a breakthrough in the Israeli-\nPalestinian peace process, perhaps enabled \nby a growing West Bank economy and a \npermanent end in terrorism, it could take on \nan importance much larger than itself \nOn the drive out of the valley, where the \nhighway swerves past the pillbox with the \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025091 \nbeaten Israeli flag and past the turnoff for \nAteret, the picture is still mixed. \nArmin Rosen writes for and produces The \nAtlantic's International Channel. \n',11:4142, \nClick here to Reply or Forward \nWhy this ad?Ads — \nTeach English Worldwide  \nBecome an English Teacher Overseas Earn Your TESOL Online \nat USC. \nrossieronline.usc.edu \n22.3 GB (10%) of 210.1 GBManage  \n©2013 Google - Terms & Privacy \nLast account activity: 0 minutes ago \nDetails \nTeach English Worldwide \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025092 \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
