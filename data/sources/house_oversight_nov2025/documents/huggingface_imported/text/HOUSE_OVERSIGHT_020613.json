Now Canada is debating that\nissue, despite the fact that the firm has established a vast network of relationships with\nall of Canada’s major telecom carriers and Canada’s leading research universities. Two\nformer directors of the Canadian Security Intelligence Service—Richard Fadden and\nWard Elcock—as well as John Adams, the former head of the Communications Security\nEstablishment (CSE), told the Globe and Mail in August that Canada should also ban\nHuawei from supplying equipment for a 5G network.\"\n\nUniversities\n\nAn example from academia suggests the efficacy of Canadian efforts to combat China’s\ninfluence operations. At one West Coast Canadian university with large numbers of\nstudents from the PRC in undergraduate humanities and social science courses, where\npotentially divergent views of China and Chinese political behavior regularly form\npart of the curriculum, there has been no observation of the pressures documented\nin Australia, where professors are often openly criticized by Chinese students for\nproposing less flattering ways of looking at China. However, at that university’s for-\nprofit “international transition program,” which offers international students who\ndid not qualify for admission the chance (for a fee) to prepare to meet entrance\nrequirements, university administrators have generally failed to integrate the students\nwho are overwhelmingly PRC Chinese with poor English ability into the broader\ncampus community. The result is that, even without PRC consular pressure, there is a\nstrong pro-PRC culture of “political correctness” that conforms to United Front goals\nwithout the effort to promote it. It appears that social isolation is the driving factor in\nthis case.\n\nConclusion\n\nMuch of China’s influence activities in Canada are a legitimate extension of the\npublic diplomacy in which all nations engage. The pressing issue is when and where\nChina crosses the line between influence and interference. Canadian experience so\nfar suggests more influence work than interference. However, there are clear examples\nwhere such influence has become interference. So far, it would appear that the key\nvariable for the relatively low impact of Chinese state efforts (or proxies) turns out to\nbe Canadian practice more than Chinese state efforts. That is, the internal diversity\nof the Canadian Chinese community blunts political efforts by any one political\nparty (including the CCP). More generally, Canadian practices of multiculturalism,\n\nAppendix 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020613",
