By the time Shimon Peres, the\nNobel Prize-winning prime minister\nof Israel who helped resolve many of\nthe more intangible issues, died more\npeacefully aged 93 in 2016, he had\nbecome one of the most accomplished\nstatesmen of our age.\n\nBut perhaps the greatest casualty\nfrom that era - when there were\ngenuine expectations on both sides of\nthe Israeli-Palestinian divide that the\nconflict might be resolved peacefully\n— has been the peace process itself,\nwhich today is almost nonexistent.\nWhen, for example, I told an Arab\nambassador acquaintance I was\ngoing to see a preview of the play,\nhe simply remarked: “No one talks\nabout the peace process any more. It\ndoesn’t exist.”\n\nThis makes Roger’s examination of\none of the most unlikely diplomatic\ndialogues ever undertaken all the\nmore poignant, as it harks back to\nan era when reconciliation seemed\ngenuinely possible.\n\nThe task facing the rival delegates\nwhen they first meet is a daunting\none. For the Israelis, if the fact became\nknown that they were talking to the\nPLO, the government would most\nlikely fall. For the Palestinians, it\nwould mean an assassin’s bullet.\n\nAt the heart of this danse macabre\nstands Red-Larsen, whom I met on\nseveral occasions in Jerusalem in the\nNineties when the hard work had\nbegun on implementing the deal. A\nquiet, patient man, he never seemed\nto be entirely comfortable with the\nrough-house atmosphere of the\nregion, where disputes were often\nmore likely to be resolved through\nrocks and rubber bullets than rational\npersuasion.\n\nToby Stephens’s portrayal of Red-\nLarsen gives him a great deal more\nzest and personality than I recall, but\nthis neatly nuanced performance is\nkey to the pace of this fast-moving,\nentertaining take on the events (Rogers\nhas said that, in order to liven up what\nmight otherwise seem a prosaic and\nconvoluted political process, he studied\n\nthe plays ot Noél Coward).\nMy favourite scene from the play\n\nFriday 15, September 2017\n\nThe Daily Telegraph {Main}\n\nGorkana\n\nA CISION» Company\n\n996 sq. cm\nABC 477927 Daily\n\npage rate £46,000.00, scc rate £214.00\n020 7931 2000\n\nNational Theatre (National)\n\nis the one where the lead Israeli\nnegotiator, taking a break from\n\nthe negotiations, entertains his\nPalestinian counterparts by giving\nan impersonation of Arafat as an\neffeminate narcissist, a portrayal I\nfound entirely plausible from my\nown encounters with the PLO leader,\nwhose vanity knew no bounds.\n\nUri Savir, who was deputed by\nPeres to run the Israeli side of the\nnegotiations, was someone else I\ngot to know during that period. An\nurbane multi-linguist of an academic\ndisposition, I generally found Uri to\nbe softly spoken and thoughtful when\ndiscussing regional issues. Philip\nArditti’s portrayal of him in the play,\nthough, makes him out to be more\nlike the uncompromising, muscular\nIsraeli type, more usually found in the\nranks of the security forces than in the\ndiplomatic service.\n\nDepictions in theatre of almost\nanything to do with the Middle East\ntend to stir strong passions among\naudiences. I was particularly struck by\nRogers’ sympathetic understanding\nof the Palestinian predicament. “I was\nvery anxious about the combustibility\nof it,” said Rogers in a recent\ninterview. “I assumed there would be\ncontroversy lin America] only because\nsomeone would be enraged that I had\nallowed the ‘other side’ to have their\nsay.” Certainly Peter Polycarpou’s\ndepiction of Ahmed Qurei, the\nPalestinian finance minister sent\nby Arafat to make peace, admirably\ncaptures the conflicting emotions\nof enduring the pain of exile while\nseeking to wreak terrible vengeance\non the Israeli occupiers.\n\nIndeed, for all the quips and\nlight-hearted banter, Os/o is, at heart,\na deeply emotional drama. When the\nIsraelis finally strike a deal with the\nPalestinians during a telephone call to\nArafat’s headquarters in Tunis, they\nthink they can hear music playing\nin the background. In fact it is the\nbattle-hardened veterans of the PLO\nsobbing at the prospect of being\nallowed to return to their homeland.\n\nUltimately, the play is an implicit\ntragedy about the failure of both sides\nto build a lasting peace on the basis of\nthe painful concessions made during\n\nReproduced by Gorkana under licence from the NLA (newspapers), CLA (magazines), FT (Financial Times/ft.com) or other copyright owner.
