Interview each\nprovider you consider to understand the options and costs involved.\n\nThe former is a good option if you give the product price in an advertisement (hard offer), are offering\nfree information (lead generation), or don’t need trained salespeople who can overcome objections. In\nother words, your ad or website is pre-qualifying prospects.\n\nThe latter would more appropriately be called “sales centers.” Operators are commissioned and trained\n“closers” whose sole goal is to convert callers to buyers. These calls are often in response to “call for\ninformation/ trial/sample” ads that don’t feature a price (soft offers). Expect higher costs per sale.\n\n» LiveOps ( www.liveops.com )\n\nPioneer in home-based reps, which often ensures more calls are answered. Provides comprehensive\nservice with agents, [VR, and Spanish.
