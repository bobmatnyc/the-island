Jane Doe No. 2 is now -\n\n19.and living in Virginia, Her\nman said,\n\nBoth lawsuits contend\nthat Epstein, 55, targeted\n“economically disadvantaged\ngirls from western Palm\nBeach County” who were\nperceived as less likely to\ncomplain to authorities, or\nwhose credibility would be\nquest:oned if they did.\n\n“Both complaints are full of\nlies,” said Guy Lewis, former\nUS. attorney in Miami and\n‘one of Epstein’s many attor-\nneys. Jane Doe No. 2's lawsuit\n“is an outrageous, defamatory\ncopycat of the first.”\n\nThere has been a twist in\nthe first Jane Doe lawsuit. Her\nmother in Georgia contends\nthat her former husband\n— Jane. Doe's father — con-\nsulted with neither of them\nbefore filing the lawsuit. She\n\n. is asking a judge to. halt the\n\nlitigation until her daughter\nturns 18 in May and can make\nher own decisions.\n\nThe mother asked in court\nfilings to be added to the law-\nsuit, saying she “has suffered\nand will continue to suffer\nsevere mental anguish and\npain’ as a result of Epstein’s\n“reckless conduct.”\n\nJane Doe “just didn’t want\nthe lawsuit ‘going forward\nwith the fathers involve-\nment,” said Ted Leopold,\nthe mother’s attorney. “She\nwanted to pursue it on her\nown. The father essentially\ndid this on his own.”\n\nJane Doe has’ béen es-\n\ntranged from her father since\n\nThanksgiving, Leopold said.\n“That's why it's even stranger\nwhat he did,” he said.\n\n.

He was the target of\na lengthy investigation into\nhis activities with girls by the\nPalm Beach Police Depart-\nment that resulted in his in-\ndictment in July 2006 on one\ncount of felony solicitation\nof prostitution. That case is\npending. ; ’\nEpstein has been sued in\nNew York by a woman who\nsays he had sex with her\n\nwhen she was 16. Herman :\n\nsaid he has received calls\n\nfrom others making the same |\n\nassertions in that state.\n\nHetman convened a news\nconference Wednesday on\nthe middle bridge connecting\nWest Palm Beach and Palm\nBeach.\n\n“This is the bridge... these |}\n\ngirls were recruited to come\nover and give a massage,” he\nsaid. “When they crossed this\nbridge, they had no idea what\n\nwas in store for them, This is_\n\na bridge of tears.”\n\nHerman has described\nboth Jane Does as typical\nteenage girls Epstein robbed\nof their innocence.\n\nBut Harvard University law\nProfessor Alan Dershowitz,\nanother Epstein attorney, pro-\nvided the state attorney's of-\nfice with information gleaned\nfrom the myspace.com Web\nsite two years ago showing\nthat some of Epstein’s alleged\nvictims boasted of their alco-\nhol and marijuana use.\n\nHerman said the girly\n\nbackgrounds aren’t relevant {|\n\nto Epstein’s purported. be-\nhavior. “They don’t have the\nmental capacity to consent\nto something like this with a\ngrown man,” he said.\n\n@larry_keller@pbpost.com\n\nve\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021524",
