As a percentage of revenue, School Partnerships accounts for 3.3% of total pro forma\nrevenue in 2005, and is projected to grow to 6.0% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in the School\nPartnerships business will be primarily driven by growth in the SES market (more school districts required\nto offer supplemental services), and an increase in the number of parent pay locations in the U.S.\n\nKC Distance Learning\n\nKCDL is projected to grow from $10.0 million in pro forma revenues in 2005 to $41.6 million in 2011, Asa\npercentage of revenue, KCDL accounts for 0.7% of total pro forma revenue in 2005, and is projected to\ngrow to 1.8% in 2011. KLC OpCo projects that growth in this line will predaminantly come from the\nexpansion of KCDL's direct to family business (which currently accounts for approximately 90% of pro\nforma revenue) and the expansion of states to digital high school courses (which KLC believes it is in a\nposition to provide on an outsourced basis).\n\nGross Margin\n\nKLC OpCo's pro forma gross profit is projected to increase from $244.4 million in 2005 to $501.3 million\nin 2011. The growth in gross profit is projected to be largely driven by increased center efficiency as a\nresult of improved Utilization, continued tuition increases and the closure of underperforming centers and\nshift in the revenue mix to more profitable business lines (/.e., more employer-sponsored centers, KCDL,\nancillary products and services). KLC OpCo's gross margin is projected to improve from approximately\n16.5% of total revenues in fiscal year 2006 to 21.9% in fiscal year 2011 as a result of these factors.\n\nSelling, General and Administrative Expenses\n\nDue to the relatively fixed nature of KLC OpCo's selling, general and administrative (GG&A) expenses,\nKLC OpCo projects that SG&A will increase at a rate of 4.5% annually after 2006. Additionally,\nmanagement estimates that there will be a one-time increase of $2.0 in SG&A related to the expansion of\nthe SES business in 2007.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA Margins\n\nKLC OpCo projects improving pro forma Adjusted EBITDA from $149.9 million in fiscal year 2005 to\n$320.1 million in fiscal year 2011.
