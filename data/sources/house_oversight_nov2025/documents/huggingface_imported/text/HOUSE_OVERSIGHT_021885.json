What the Palm Beach Police Department had\ndiscovered was brazen, notorious, repetitive activity\nsometimes occurring as often as three times in a\nparticular day. And so that led me to believe that the\nsexual activity that was going on in Florida was such\nthat someone who was a regular house guest there would\nhave immediately come to the conclusion that, well,\nlook, gee, there are these underage girls coming in here\nand they seem to be -- you know, they don't seem to be\nhere to be doing business activities, they might be here\ndoing other kinds of activity.
