He said the agency will know by early September whether the system will be ready in time.\n\nIf not, he said, customers will still be able to log on to the Web site and peruse insurance plans and view prices. When they\nget to the final step, however, they will not be able to sign up. They will have to contact a customer service representative to\ncomplete the final enrollment step.\n\nOfficials with the District of Columbia’s Health Link decided to put off building a Spanish version of its Web site until later this\nyear, giving its staff bandwidth to complete other tasks they see more critical to the launch.\n\nUntil then, the District will have bilingual call-center workers and in-person helpers who will be able to help Spanish speakers\nnavigate the site.\n\nThe hiccups are troubling to advocates, who worry that there will be mistakes that result in people being erroneously\nrejected by Medicaid or denied subsidies to which they are entitled. They are concerned that impediments will discourage\nthe uninsured from signing up for coverage.\n\n“There will be something up and running, but there will be serious, serious difficulties with it” that could result in delays and\nerrors initially, said Robert H. Bonthius Jr., a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland. “It’s an extremely ambitious\nprogram, well-intentioned, that is going to be very difficult to accomplish, and it’s going to be months and maybe years\nbefore it really gets sorted out.”\n\nMuch of the difficulty stems from the information the federal government needs to determine who qualifies for which health-\nlaw program, including data on citizenship, income, residence and employment. State systems will need to communicate\nseamlessly with a federal data hub that pulls in information from the Department of Homeland Security and the Internal\nRevenue Service, among others.\n\nPresident Obama has predicted “bumps” and “glitches” in the initial launch of the exchanges. Health and Human Services\nSecretary Kathleen Sebelius has acknowledged a very tight time frame that has required the government to test the hub in\nimperfect conditions, but she has said it will still launch on time.\n\n“Ideally what you would do if you were building a data hub that needs this kind of information, you’d put a piece together and\ntest that. You test it, if you will, sequentially,” she said in an interview. “We have to build and test simultaneously. ... It’s a big\noperational issue, but all systems are a go for the first of October.”\n\nSixteen states decided to build their own health-insurance marketplaces, with the rest leaving all or much of the task to the\nfederal government. Those states are now in the process of, or have completed, testing to share data back and forth with the\ndata hub.\n\n“There were times when the hub had to be taken offline. .. . So we couldn't test until they got it back online,” said Jon Hager,\nexecutive director of Nevada’s Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. “But | think the end result, and everything I’ve seen,\n\nsays it will be ready.”\n\nHager has invested significant time preparing contingency plans for his state, including one for a situation in which the\nfederal data hub does not work, though he said he believes that to be a relatively unlikely scenario.\n\n“If there’s a new rule, that could throw us into a quandary,” Hager said. “You could have, | don’t know, a disaster ora fire. |\nthink we’ve got backup and contingency plans for everything.”\n\nThe federal government handles all testing of these connections for states that did not build a portal and chose instead to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019426",
