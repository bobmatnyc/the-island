The case of Norway\nhas relevance for the Gulf Cooperation Council countries (GCC), including Saudi Arabia,\nespecially since oil discovery (late 1960s) and oil production (1970s) timelines were not\nthat sensibly different from the GCC.\n\nThat being said, outcomes were widely different as well as the starting point since\nNorway was already a developed country with mature social, economic and political\ninstitutions at the time of the discovery of oil. This allowed a distinction between the\nmanagement and ownership of natural resources uncommon in the GCC and several\nother resource-based economies, in our view.\n\nFour ways in which the supply-side matters for economic diversification\nWe believe that there are four lessons to learn from Norway’s outperformance:\n\n1) The importance of human capital\nNorway’s priorities from early on were to build human capacity, investing in education,\nincreasing labor force participation and supporting productivity growth.\n\n2) Prudent conduct of fiscal policy\n\nCurrent Norwegian oil revenue management puts considerable emphasis on stabilizing\nthe economy and facilitating a gradual phase-in of oil revenues over time (which crowds\nout trophy projects and put onus on achieving productivity gains in the non-oil sector).\nFollowing the 1970-80s boom-bust sequence and expansion of the welfare state,\nNorway established in 1991 a Government Petroleum Fund to receive and invest oil\nrevenue (it received its first net transfer in 1996). The fiscal rule adopted in 2001\ntargets a central government structural non-oil budget deficit equal to 4% of GPF assets\n(the latter assumed to be its estimated long-run real rate of return). That being said,\nSaudi Arabia’s infrastructure requirements could have prevented adapting this part of\nNorway’s model for long, in our view.\n\n3) Institutional experience\n\nNorway’s development has been characterized by continuous development and\nintegration of resource-based export-oriented industries, some of which were active\nsince 1950. While Norway is the world’s third largest exporter of natural gas and the\nsixth largest of crude oil, it is also the second largest exporter of seafood, possesses the\nfourth largest shipping fleet, is the sixth largest exporter of aluminium and the first\nexporter of sub-sea technology products and services.\n\n32 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016142",
