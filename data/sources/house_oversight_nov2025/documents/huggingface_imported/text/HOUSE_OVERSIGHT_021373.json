  "text": "when they hold such beliefs? Can they\nbe made to feel less lonely by calling\nthem to mind? More specifically, how\ndoes the influence of this construal on\nfeelings of social isolation compare with\nthat of other construals—for example, a\nconstrual that directly associates God’s\ncreative influence with the irredeemable\nbad? How might the stronger sense of\nGod’s presence in the hardships one\nsuffers balance out in the latter case\nagainst the unhappy quality of the\nconnection? Might one feel oneself to be\nbetter off alone, in other words, if God is\nas much one’s tormentor as one’s\nbenefactor? Finally, comparable\nproblems to the ones for belief surface in\nthe more experience-driven God-as-\nfriend outlook in Christianity, and make\nexperimental testing pertinent.” If the\nproblem in both cases is that a strong\nsense of connection with God is hard to\nsustain—because God is invisible in the\none case or crowded out by more\nobviously pressing matters in the\nother—how is the imaginative force of\nthe idea of relationship with God better\nshored up? By imagining that one is ona\ndate with God, or by imagining that God\nis always all around one like the air one\nbreathes or the sun that shines? And\nwhat works for the greater number of\npeople? What if the former imaginative\ncapacities are hard to cultivate, and\nrequire in any case exceptional abilities\nof concentration or inward focus that\nmany people lack? Might beliefs be\neasier for most people to hold in mind\nwithout sustained or disciplined\npractice? A simple visit to church or\noccasional perusal of a prayer book\nwould do?\n\nReferences\n\n* For the general importance of belief for such\ninvestigation, see the essays by W.
