Among other things,\nthe episode shattered the old political establishment,\nwhich had been more or less equally divided between\nparties that were friendly to Russia and parties that\nfavored independence from the Kremlin and an\norientation toward Europe. For the foreseeable future,\npro-Russian parties were unlikely to play a major role\nin Ukrainian political life.\n\nRussia responded by seizing and illegally annexing\nCrimea and fomenting a frozen conflict in eastern\nUkraine. But the Kremlin also stepped up its campaign\nto demonize color revolutions more broadly as Amer-\nicas favored instrument of regime change, though no\nserious evidence of U.S. involvement in the Maidan\nrevolution was put forward. The color revolution threat\nbecame a major theme of Russian domestic propa-\nganda and political discourse. It even became a focus\nof the country's military planning.\n\nWhen speaking of color revolutions, Russian officials\nand commentators have struck several common\nthemes:\n\n1. Color revolutions are a U.S. strategy to break\nRussia's influence over its neighbors.' Nikolay\nPatrushev, secretary of Russia's Security Council\nand a longtime director of the Federal Security\nService (FSB), has described color revolutions\nas an American scheme to bring down gov-\nernments through the financing of opposition\ngroups and economic sanctions “under the pre-\ntext of human rights protection and the neces-\nsity to form civil society institutions.”? Russian\nofficials in 2015 warned that Electric Yerevan, an\nArmenian protest movement against electricity\nprice hikes, could be a provocation by the West\ndedicated to toppling a Moscow-friendly admin-\nistration?\n\n2. The threat of military action is an integral part of\nthe strategy. While color revolutions by definition\nemploy nonviolent tactics, Russian strategists\nclaim that the military dimension can be indirect,\nembedded in democratic governments’ warnings\nnot to use force against protesters. In other words,\naccording to the Kremlin, the United States and\nits allies stoke uprisings and then threaten to in-\ntervene if the authorities defend themselves. Rus-\nsias own response to the Maidan revolution was a\nreflection of this distorted image: It orchestrated\n\nseparatist revolts in parts of Ukraine and then\nused its military to defend them.*\n\n3. Color revolutions pose a danger to Russias allies\naround the world. To communicate its concerns\non this front, the Kremlin has invited military\ndelegations from China, Iran, Egypt, and other\nauthoritarian regimes for meetings at which\ncountering color revolutions is an important\ntheme.® Russian propaganda encourages gov-\nernments to do what is necessary to put down\ncivil society challenges, and praises incumbents\nwho succeed.\n\n4. Russia itself is under threat. “The aim is obvi-\nous,” Putin said of protests and social media ac-\ntivity in 2015, “to provoke civil conflict and strike\na blow at our country's constitutional founda-\ntions, and ultimately even at our sovereignty.”®\n\n5. Incumbents are ‘legitimate’ rulers. Russian offi-\ncials have stressed the legal and constitutional\nlegitimacy of authoritarian leaders facing major\nprotests, regardless of their crimes and blatant\nabuses of human rights and democratic norms.\nMoscow insisted that Yanukovych remained the\n“legitimate” president even after he had aban-\ndoned his post to escape punishment for his\nrole in the crackdown on demonstrators.\n\n6. Russia reserves the right to intervene in defense\nof ethnic Russians. By asserting this right, the\nKremlin is effectively saying that any color rev-\nolutions in neighboring states—many of which\nhave Russian-speaking minorities—could trigger\na Russian invasion, as in Ukraine. It could also\nbecome a self-fulfilling prophecy, whereby the\ngovernments of neighboring countries come\nto mistrust and mistreat their ethnic Russian\ncitizens, providing the Kremlin with an excuse to\nget involved.’\n\nThe Russian leadership's reaction to the color revolu-\ntions, with its paranoid obsession with sinister outside\nforces, is a clear indication of the lack of self-confidence\nthat is shared by all authoritarian powers. Whether the\nstate is led by a strongman, a politburo, or a supreme\nreligious leader, the world’s most repressive regimes\nunderstand that their systems offer few regular outlets\nfor public frustration with government performance.\n\nFear of color revolutions has intensified since the 2014\nevents in Ukraine, with a particular focus on the alleged\n\n24\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019258",
