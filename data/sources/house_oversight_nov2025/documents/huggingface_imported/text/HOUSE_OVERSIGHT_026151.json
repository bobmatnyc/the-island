  "text": "possibly around 0.8, with 0.5x being the floor. An indicative amount for buying the\n90% of the shares with EBRD holding the remaining 10% should be in the region\nof EUR 110 million.\n\nI expect that an IRR greater than 25% can be achieved considering the profitability\nof the current assets at c. EUR 50 million excluding trading gains, the additional\nprofitability from organic expansion in lending at the levels assumed by IMF for\nthe banking market and assuming that the exit from the investment will be\nachieved at the same multiple as that of the entry level (0.8x).\n\nI am available at any time to discuss the above. Should your investors be interested\nin the project I would be more than happy to meet them and arrange their meeting\nwith EBRD. The next step following our meeting with EBRD would be to meet\nBNP and, in case they accept a bilateral process, to arrange and manage the deal\nprocess. As discussed my main objective is to lead manage the bank with a\ncompetent management team, to be compensated by “sweat equity”, and looking\nforward to be a major participant in the consolidation of the industry.\n\nI will also send to you the latest benchmarking review of the banking sector we are\npreparing for your perusal.\n\nBest regards,\n\nYannis\n\n18\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026151",
