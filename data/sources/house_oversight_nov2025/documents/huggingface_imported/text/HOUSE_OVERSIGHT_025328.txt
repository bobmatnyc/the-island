For Radio Host
Of the Counterculture,
It Was a Strange Trip

By COREY KILGANNON

For a half century, Bob Fass, 85,
has presided over the late-night
airwaves of New York City with a
radio show named “Radio Un-
nameable,” which has aired since
1963 on WBAI-FM, the listener-
supported haven for the radical
left.

As a self-described “midwife at
the birth of the counterculture,”
Mr. Fass, in his time behind the
microphone, has borne witness to
some unusual episodes.

The second night his show
aired, a listener set the tone by de-
livering marijuana to the station.
There was the time, in 1966, when
Bob Dylan showed up in the studio
and began taking callers and
cracking jokes. In 1971, Mr. Fass
essentially talked a caller out of
committing suicide while on the
air.

But lately, Mr. Fass’s life has be-
gun imitating the craziness of his
show, ever since he and his wife,
Lynnie, attempted to move out of
their Staten Island home to a new
house in Danbury, Conn., setting
off a misadventure worthy of one
of his distressed late night callers.

Last month, moments after he
entered his new home, as the
movers were carrying in his be-
longings, Mr. Fass casually flicked
on a gas fireplace, which promptly
malfunctioned and set the house
on fire.

It was a two-alarm blaze that
left Mr. Fass, who uses a wheel-
chair, inhaling smoke for several
minutes until the movers rushed
in and carried him out.

“I could have been roast D.J.,”
said Mr. Fass. “Have you ever
heard the Warren Zevon song ‘I
was in the House When the House
Burned Down?’”

And so the “Unnameable” radio
host now faces an unknowable fu-
ture.

Even in adversity, though, Mr.
Fass, whose show airs Thursday
nights at midnight, can be counted
on for a pithy take on things. His
improvisational monologues and
his mix of guests and music
helped pioneer free-form radio,
and his show was a vital forum for
activists, musicians, and every-
day people to come together
around issues including the Viet-
nam War, drugs and social justice.

After the fire, with nowhere else
to stay, the Fasses returned to
their empty house on Lake Ave-
nue on Staten Island, near the
Bayonne Bridge, where they live
with their 10 or so adopted feral
cats.

A single couch now serves as
their shared bed as they sort out
their future. Most of their belong-
ings either remain in storage or
were damaged by the fire.

The bulk of Mr. Fass’s radio ar-
chive was recently acquired by
Columbia University, with pay-
ment for the acquisition going to-
ward the new house, he said.

But numerous boxes of radio re-
cordings that Columbia had not
acquired were damaged in the
fire, Mr. Fass said.

“There’s a lot of history in
there,” said Mr. Fass, who is no
stranger to dealing with tumul-
tuous events: His show became
both acommunications and cover-
age hub for Yippie events, the 1963
March on Washington, the 1968
Democratic National Convention
in Chicago and the 1988 Tompkins
Square Park riot.

His callers have ranged from
Black Panthers to John Lennon to
ordinary New Yorkers. One of Mr.
Dylan’s first broadcast appear-
ances was on Radio Unnameable.
The Yippie movement leader Ab-
bie Hoffman was a regular guest,
as were Hunter S. Thompson, Al-
len Ginsberg and Timothy Leary.

The Danbury house fire oc-
curred just before the Fasses were
set to close on both the sale of the
Staten Island house and the pur-
chase of the Danbury home. So
the fate and details of both trans-
actions are in limbo, he said.

The Fasses said they signed an
agreement with the developer
buying their house stipulating
that they vacate by the original
move-out date last month or face
daily monetary penalties.

A lawyer for the buyer did not
respond to messages.

Even if they had the money to
rent a place, it might be hard to
find a landlord who would wel-
come a colony of cats, said Mr.
Fass, who had already taken two
of the cats to the Danbury house.
During the fire, one of them,
Plutarch, escaped and remained
missing for several weeks, until
Ms. Fass found him.

Mr. Fass recently completed a
three-month hospital stay and is
recovering from heart problems.
The smoke inhalation from the
fire has added a chronic cough to
his health concerns.

Mr. Fass, a native of Brooklyn
who lived for decades in Manhat-
tan, moved to Staten Island 25
years ago, but said he had grown
weary of the increasing truck traf-
fic at a warehouse across the
street.

The Danbury house was an af-

fordable option that allowed Ms.
Fass to continue to commute to
her paralegal job in Brooklyn. Mr.
Fass had been broadcasting his
show remotely in recent years
from a studio in his house, and
planned on doing so from Dan-
bury.

In interviews, the Fasses’ bro-
ker and the lawyer handling the
purchase of the Danbury house
both insisted that the Fasses will
be able to move into the house af-
ter a renovation covered by the
seller’s homeowners insurance.

But the Fasses said they have
no guarantee of this, and with
much of the purchase price for the
Danbury house in escrow, they
are being pressured to close on
the property.

“This type of thing is really not
my area, and I have no money for
a lawyer to figure it out,” said Mr
Fass, whose radio career was de-
picted in a 2012 documentary, “Ra-
dio Unnameable.”

The seller of the Danbury home
did not respond to an email, and
her lawyer, Lawrence M. Rief-
berg, said he could not comment
without her permission.

In a poetic reversal, Mr. Fass re-
cently called in to his own show —
which is being temporarily han-
dled by a colleague, Bill Propp —
and. described the fire story on
WBAI (where this reporter is an
unpaid co-host of a weekly talk
show).

Mr. Fass said he stopped receiv-
ing a salary from WBAI in 1977
and relies on Social Security bene-
fits. Over the years, some of his lis-
teners have donated to a retire-
ment fund for him.

After the fire, some of his long-

Tal ie

time listeners — the Fass “cabal,”
as he has always called them — or-
ganized pages, which have raised
roughly $2,000.

On the radio, Mr. Fass often
helped raise funds for demonstra-
tions and for legal defenses for
such figures as the boxer Rubin
“Hurricane” Carter, the activist
Wavy Gravy and Mr. Hoffman, not
to mention institutions like the
East Village Other newspaper.

“Bob’s been a voice for the peo-
ple for so long, and so many listen-
ers have called in to his show in
their time of need,” said Jessica
Wolfson, who with Paul Lovelace,

produced and directed the “Radio
Unnameable” documentary. “And
now he has a chance to move to a
comfortable living situation and
the whole thing literally goes up in
flames.”

Resting on his couch in the liv-
ing room, next to his walker and
his oxygen tanks, Mr. Fass dis-
posed of a telemarketer by feign-
ing a heart attack while on the
phone. Then he sighed.

“[’m just overwhelmed by ev-
erything that’s happening,” he
said. “It might sound amusing, but
not when it’s happening in your
own life.”

The Cold-Case Specialist Who Wants to Put Robert

By CHARLES V. BAGLI

LOS ANGELES — When
Robert A. Durst was asked why he
had talked to the makers of “The
Jinx” — the 2015 HBO documenta-
ry about the suspicions that had
dogged him for years over the un-
timely deaths of his first wife, a
close confidante and a cantanker-
ous neighbor in Texas — he said
he had thought it was low risk.

It was unlikely, he said, that any
prosecutor would “commence a
major, budget-busting investiga-
tion” for a couple of cold cases.

But shortly before the last
episode was broadcast, John
Lewin, a deputy district attorney
in Los Angeles, proved Mr. Durst
wrong. Mr. Lewin, who has a long
record of winning guilty verdicts
in cold murder cases, had him ar-
rested in New Orleans.

Mr. Lewin would eventually
charge Mr. Durst with the execu-
tion-style murder in Los Angeles
in 2000 of his confidante, Susan
Berman. Preliminary hearings in
the case were held in a courtroom
here last week.

The prosecution contends that
Mr. Durst, the alienated scion of a
New York real estate family, killed
Ms. Berman with a gunshot to the
back of the head to prevent her
from revealing her role in helping
him cover up the murder of his
first wife, Kathie Durst, to investi-
gators who had reopened that
case.

In a sense, Mr. Lewin must
prove two cold cases, not just one.
“It is important to understand
that all of the defendant’s subse-
quent criminal conduct can be
traced back to his original killing
of his wife Kathie decades earlier,
and his subsequent efforts to
avoid criminal culpability for her
death,” he said in court papers.

Mr. Lewin, who declined to be
interviewed for this story, has
talked to virtually every witness
in the case, which covers 40 years
and has a cast of dozens. During
court hearings over the past year,
he has displayed an encyclopedic
knowledge of Mr. Durst, his his-
tory, his friends and his alleged
victims.

Mr. Lewin has conducted pun-
ishing examinations of Mr. Durst’s
friends and even of the now-re-
tired detective who first looked
into the disappearance of Ms.
Durst.

JABIN BOTSFORD/LOS ANGELES TIMES:
John Lewin, a prosecutor in Los Angeles, has an encyclopedic
knowledge of Robert Durst and a reputation as a “pit bull.”

“He’s a pit bull” said Kathie
Durst’s brother, Jim McCormack.

There is little doubt by either
side that the hearings, which ad-
journed after four days of testi-
mony and argument, will con-
clude in October with Judge Mark
Windham binding Mr. Durst over
for trial, starting probably early
next year.

But that does not mean that Mr.
Lewin has a clear path to another
guilty verdict. Mr. Lewin and his
colleagues will still have to con-
tend with hazy, in some cases 40-
year-old memories; the lack of the
weapon in Ms. Berman’s shoot-
ing; and the absence of a body or
even a crime scene in the disap-
pearance and presumed death of
Ms. Durst, for which no one has
ever been charged.

Mr. Durst, 75, frail and worth
$100 million, has said repeatedly
that he did not kill his first wife,
nor does he know who killed Ms.
Berman. And despite the cer-
tainty of a trial, Dick DeGuerin,
the Texas lawyer who leads Mr.
Durst’s defense team, insists that
the prosecution has still not prov-
en that Mr. Durst killed either
woman.

As for the hard-charging pros-
ecutor with whom he has repeat-
edly clashed, “He’s a bully, but
that’s not unusual for prosecu-
tors,’ Mr. DeGuerin said of Mr.
Lewin. “And he’s not used to peo-
ple standing up to him.”

Both sides have already in-
vested an enormous amount of
time and money in the case. Mr.

Durst’s defense is expected to cost
well in excess of $10 million, ac-
cording to two people briefed on
the matter who requested ano-
nymity because they were not au-
thorized to discuss it publicly.

Mr. Lewin, 54, looks like an out-
of-shape football lineman with a
modified crew cut. He tells jokes
at his own expense one minute
and rails at the defense the next.
But he is always about the case.

“T’m like the sloth,” he told Los
Angeles Magazine, referring to
the mammal that spend most of its
time hanging upside down in
trees. “I have this one skill.”

Since he won his first cold case
in 2002, Mr. Lewin has stacked up
16 guilty verdicts or pleas, the
magazine said.

His first cold case resurfaced
this year when a state panel ruled
that William Bradford, whom Mr.
Lewin successfully tried for the
murder of his wife after the case
lay dormant for 12 years, and who
is now 84, deserved parole,a move
that Mr. Lewin vehemently op-
posed.

Mr. Lewin’s decision to pick up
the Berman case was propelled, in
part, by the producers of “The
Jinx,” Andrew Jarecki and Marc
Smerling, who brought the au-
thorities what they believed was
new evidence about Ms. Berman’s
murder and the disappearance of
Ms. Durst.

On Dec. 24, 2000, the police
found the body of Ms. Berman, a
sometime screenwriter, in her
Benedict Canyon home in Los An-

geles, shot in the back of the head.
Someone had sent a note to the
Beverly Hills Police Department
alerting them toa “cadaver” at the
address.

Suspicion quickly passed from
Ms. Berman’s landlady to her
manager before landing on Mr
Durst. But once again, little came
of it.

In interviews with “The Jinx”
producers, Mr. Durst admitted
that he had lied to police in 1982
about his whereabouts at the time
his wife disappeared and de-
scribed how his marriage had be-
come a series of “half arguments,
fighting, slapping, pushing,
wrestling.”

In a scene depicted in “The
Jinx,’ Mr. Durst could not distin-
guish between the handwriting on
the envelope of the “cadaver”
note, which misspelled Beverly
Hills as “Beverley,” and a note he
had sent to Ms. Berman with the
same misspelling.

The documentary ended fa-
mously with Mr. Durst muttering
off camera, “What the hell did I
do? Killed them all of course.”

Mr. DeGuerin has dismissed the
documentary as a Hollywood con-
coction.

After having Mr. Durst arrested
on a murder warrant and gun
charges, Mr. Lewin hopped a
plane to New Orleans and man-
aged to interview him for three
hours before he was arraigned. In
the interview, Mr. Lewin compli-
mented and cajoled Mr. Durst,
suggesting he would never be a
free man, although he might be
able to negotiate a plea.

The defense challenged the in-
terrogation as “improper and de-
ceptive.” Mr. Lewin responded an-
grily in a brief to what he de-
scribed as “baseless allegations,”
along with a video and transcript
of the entire encounter.

With no witnesses and no mur-
der weapon, Mr. Lewin has been
building a case out of tiny puzzle
pieces. He may have set a record
for the use of what are known as
conditional hearings, in which a
prosecutor can question wit-
nesses 65 or older who could die or
become ill before trial — he
brought 20 witnesses to the stand
for them. A judge must determine
whether any of the testimony is
admissible at trial.

In response to a 12-page motion
from the defense to exclude any

Durst Away

statements Ms. Berman allegedly
made to her friends as hearsay,
Mr. Lewin responded in March
with what has become known as
“Big Boy”: a 77-page brief accom-
panied by 316 pages of exhibits.

At times, the space between the
defense and prosecution tables
has crackled. Mr. Lewin once
made a remark about “these law-
yers being paid millions of dol-
lars.” It was not long before Mr.
DeGuerin bounced back with a
crack about Mr. Lewin driving a
Porsche.

Mr. Lewin’s full-court press has
occasionally rankled Judge Wind-
ham, particularly when he contin-
ues to argue a motion after the
judge has ruled in his favor.
“Youre interrupting my think-
ing,” the normally Zen-like judge
said at one point last Thursday.
“Please be quiet.”

The prosecution scored two vic-
tories last week when Judge
Windham ruled that he would ac-
cept testimony from 13 friends
who say Ms. Berman confided to
them that she assisted Mr. Durst
in the cover-up and had been ex-
pecting him to visit her around the
time of her murder. The judge also
accepted testimony and records
concerning incidents of domestic
violence in the Durst marriage,
pending challenges by the de-
fense.

Karen Minutello, the former
manager of the Manhattan build-
ing where the Dursts had an
apartment in 1982, testified dur-
ing last week’s hearing that Ms.
Durst had called her shortly be-
fore her disappearance, saying
that she was looking for another
apartment in the building because
“she needed to get away” from her
husband.

A week after Ms. Durst disap-
peared, Ms. Minutello said, she
saw the porters pulling her note-
books, textbooks, makeup and
clothing from a jammed trash
compactor in the basement of the
building. Ms. Minutello deter-
mined that it had all been shoved
down the chute from the Dursts’
15th-floor apartment.

“Who does that?” Ms.
Minutello said. “Their loved one
missing and you throw out their
stuff”

She said she expected to be
questioned by the police. She “al-
ways expected them to” call, she
went on, “and they never did.”

INTERNATIONAL

An article on Monday about the
number of women and Afro-Cu-
bans chosen to serve under Cuba’s
new president referred incor-
rectly to research about the racial
balance among college students in
Cuba and the United States in the
1980s. A study by Alejandro de la
Fuente found that the proportion,
not the number, of black Cubans
with degrees compared with white
Cubans was close, and that the
proportion, not the number, of
white college degree holders in
the United States was twice that of
African-Americans. The study
also referred to graduation rates,
not attendance.

Anarticle on Monday about pro-
tests against social security
changes in Nicaragua misstated
the legal changes that allowed
Daniel Ortega to win a presiden-
tial election in 2007. He was al-
lowed to win by a plurality, not a
simple majority.

An article on Sunday about the
reception of Miguel Diaz-Canel
Bermidez, Cuba’s new president,
described incorrectly adjust-
ments to immigration policy un-
der the Obama administration.
President Barack Obama ended
“wet foot dry foot,” a rule that al-
lowed Cubans who arrived with-
out visas to remain in the United
States. He did not end the Cuban
adjustment act.

Anarticle on Saturday about the
actress Natalie Portman’s deci-
sion to skip the Genesis Prize cer-
emony in Jerusalem referred in-
correctly to Scarlett Johansson’s
departure from the charity Oxfam.
She resigned as a spokeswoman;
she was not dropped.

Because of an editing error, an
article on Saturday about an auc-
tion to sell historical objects in
Heathrow Airport misstated how
many passengers Heathrow’s Ter-
minal 1 could accommodate when
it was dedicated in 1969. It was
nine million passengers a year, not
aday.

BUSINESS DAY

An article on Sunday about
Campbell Brown’s role as Face-
book’s head of news partnerships
erroneously included a reference
to Palestinian actions as an exam-
ple of the sort of far-right conspir-
acy stories that have plagued
Facebook. In fact, Palestinian offi-
cials have acknowledged provid-
ing payments to the families of
Palestinians killed while carrying
out attacks on Israelis or con-
victed of terrorist acts and impris-
oned in Israel; that is not a con-
spiracy theory.

An article on Saturday about
President Trump’s criticism of
OPEC and rising oil prices mis-
stated, in one reference, a recent
increase in gasoline prices. They
have risen 33 cents in the last year,
not the last month.

An article on Wednesday about
budget airlines reinvigorating
smaller airports on the outskirts
of major cities misstated the dis-
tance between Seattle Tacoma In-
ternational Airport and Paine
Field. They are about 37 miles
apart, not 12.

SPORTS

An article on Friday about the
hesitance of the International As-
sociation of Athletics Federations
to allow Russian athletes to com-
pete in major track and field
events misstated Sebastian Coe’s
title within the organization dur-
ing an extortion scheme. He was
vice president, not senior vice
president.

THE ARTS

A picture caption with an article
on Saturday about the Actors’ Eq-
uity Association’s decision to re-
tire the term “Gypsy Robe”
misidentified the “Cats” cast
member wearing the garment. He
is Jeremy Davis, not Jeremy Ford.

An opera review on Monday
about “The Metromaniacs” by Da-
vid Ives, using information from a
publicist, misstated the number of
French plays from the 17th and
18th centuries that David Ives has
translated. It is four, not three. The
review also misstated the number
of plays that were collected for “All
in the Timing.” It is six, not three.

OBITUARIES

Anobituary on Friday about the
record producer and songwriter
Ronald Dunbar omitted the name
of one of his survivors. In addition
to those named, he is survived by
a daughter, Ginger Atherton.

An obituary on April 15 about
the actor Tim O’Connor misidenti-
fied the county in New Jersey
where Glen Wild Lake, the site of
an island where he and his wife
lived for many years, is located. It
is Passaic, not Essex.
