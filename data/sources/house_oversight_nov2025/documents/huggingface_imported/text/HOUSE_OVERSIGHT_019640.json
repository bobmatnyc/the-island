  "text": "Lb 2 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nnections. Making the task even more risky, according to my Booz\nAllen source, there were closed-circuit cameras. The only way he\ncould mitigate the risk of detection was by having someone help\nhim build this network.\n\nEven if Snowden had managed to obtain all the necessary pass-\nwords from colleagues, he would have had to transfer the files to an\nexternal storage device. This was not a matter of simply attaching\na thumb drive or other external device to a port, because, unlike in\nmovies such as Mission: Impossible, the ports on the computers at\nthe NSA were ordinarily sealed shut. This measure was taken spe-\ncifically to prevent any unauthorized downloading by NSA workers.\nThe only people at the center who had the authorization, and the\nmeans, to open these ports and transfer data were system admin-\nistrators, according to the former Booz Allen executive. System\nadministrators needed to have this privilege to deal with glitches\nin the computers. Snowden was no longer a system administrator\nand had no such privileges. So again, he would have needed help.\nHe would have needed to either borrow a system administrator’s\n\n® credential or forge his own. ®\n\nThe credential he would need is called a public key infrastructure,\nor PKI, card with its authentication code embedded in a magnetic\nstrip. When I asked the former Booz Allen executive if Snowden\npossessed the skill set to forge such a card, he said that he strongly\ndoubted any NSA employee would be capable of such a forgery\nwithout special equipment. Just asking such a favor could “set off\nalarms,” my source said.\n\nThe unwitting accomplice scenario had another stumbling block:\ntime. We know from Poitras that Snowden told her in early April\n2013 that he planned to deliver documents to her in six to eight\nweeks (which he in fact did). But he had not yet started working for\nBooz Allen at the center until that same month. It does not seem\nplausible that in making such a commitment he was merely count-\ning on his ingenuity in the face of strangers to fulfill it. The only way\nhe could have known for certain that he would be able to borrow a\nPKI card and obtain the passwords, whether by trickery, by observa-\ntion, or by a key router, before he had begun working at the center\nwas that he already knew someone there who would help him.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 152 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019640",
