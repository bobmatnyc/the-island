  "text": "Knowledge 135\n\nThe 80 characters of this poem versus the 52 playing cards and the\ngreater choice offered by 26 letters increases the problem geometrically.\nTaken together the probability of accidentally getting this poem is vastly\nless than a perfect hand of bridge, 1 in 10® against the perfect bridge\nhand of 1 in 10”. That’s the difference between the number of atoms\nin the known universe and the number of atoms in a jug of water!\nNumbers get big very quickly when we are looking at the permutation\nof information. And there is another problem with our bridge analogy.\nAll the bridge players in the world are part of the machine finding the\nperfect hand. When a human sees a perfect bridge hand they are amazed.\nIt is an event that usually hits the local newspapers and a couple of years\nago one reached the national papers in Britain. Each bridge player looks\nat every hand, they play so there is a huge amount of processing going on\nduring every bridge game. To replicate this for our poem, we would need\nmillions of poetry classes spending hours each evening reading through\ncomputer printouts of gibberish.\n\nI should also add that sightings of perfect bridge hands are almost\ncertainly hoaxes. The probability of it happening even once would\nrequire everyone on Earth to play bridge continuously for a thousand\nyears. It is reported somewhere in the world about two or three times a\nyear. If we are charitable, we might assume people failed to shuffle the\ndeck properly but I suspect some mischief is going on! The numbers\ndon't stack up...\n\nYou might think the problem is one of improving the efficiency of\nthe filter so humans would only have to examine a smaller number of\npossibilities. Surely I could improve things by writing a simple program\nto ban all non-English characters, words and poor grammar; things that\ndon't pass the Microsoft Word grammar checker. This would generate a\nmore manageable number of potential poems.\n\nLewis Carroll shows this does not work; my idea to use a grammar\nand spelling checker to filter out gibberish just eliminated Jabberwocky,\none of the most famous verses in the English language. Take a look at\nwhat Microsoft Word thinks of it.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015825",
