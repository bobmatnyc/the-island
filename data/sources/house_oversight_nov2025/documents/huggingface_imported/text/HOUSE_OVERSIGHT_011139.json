  "text": "reading “pay less prior claims on pay equals earned pay equals gross realized work\n\nequals realized work plus realized (recovered) human depreciation”.\n\nPrior claims means outflow (transfer out), from sources other than the direct\nreceiver of revenue, which are recovered in it and owed back to them. Maintenance\nconsumption can be defined as any transfer out from any asset of either factor,\noutside the human capital of the earner, which supports pay in the sense that any\n\nless maintenance consumption would have realized less pay. This meets every\n\ncriterion of prior claims but one. Maintenance consumption is the prior claims\n\nmeant by z, in (A5.5) if and only if it is actually recovered in pay or so intended.\n\nI gave my arguments that it is neither, but is rather exhausted in satisfying our taste\n\nfor survival, in Chapter 6 and elsewhere. If I am right, (A5.4) gives\n\nm,.=0 and = W, +D(H), = W, gross , (A5.5)\n\nso that pay would measure and compensate gross realized work. This is the pay rule.\n\nBy (A3.3), positive cash flow is gross realized output less plowback from revenue.\n\nThat comes to\n\nF(H), = W, gross 1, =a-T, . (A5.6)\n\nNow we have\n\nF(H)=F(H), -F(H)_ =2-2,-(C,-2,)=2-2,-C.+m,=2-C, , (A5.7)\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011139",
