  "text": "— The ECE industry generates approximately $54 billion in total spending in the U.S. and has grown\nat a compound annual growth rate of 10% since 1982. It is expected to grow at a 3.4%\ncompounded annual rate through 2010 according to Harris Nesbitt research. The ECE industry’s\ngrowth has been driven by several favorable social and demographic trends including: the increase\nin working mothers and single-parent or dual-income families, historically high birth rates, and\nincrease in popularity of center-based care.\n\nNet opening of new centers as the integration of KinderCare winds down and the number of center\nopenings starts exceeding the number of closures.\n\nLeverage of KLC OpCo's footprint to market additional educational products and services to the\nmore than 300,000 children KLC OpCo interacts with each year, their parents, grandparents and\nother child care providers. Selected incremental revenue opportunities include: foreign language or\nmusic lessons, educational materials and financial services (life insurance, health insurance, tuition\nfinancing, etc.).\n\nGrowth through acquisitions and industry consolidation\n\n—- Consolidation strategy supported by the highly fragmented early childhood industry, with for-profit\nchains representing only approximately 5% of the market In aggregate, and small independent\nproviders representing 60% of the market.\n\n— Management has demonstrated an ability to grow through acquisitions, as evidenced by the three\nnetworks acquired by KLC since inception, of sizes up to 1,000 centers.\n\nMultiple drivers of expected double-digit growth at k12\n— Existing school enrollment rates at k12 expected to continue to increase at double digit rates for at\n\nleast the next three years, as k12 further penetrates its existing markets through commercial and\nmarketing push.\n\n— ki2 currently operates virtual public schools in 11 states and the District of Columbia. As\nlegislatures in other states permit the formation of virtual public schools, k12 expects to have\nopportunities to expand into new states.\n\n\"4 Utilization is calculated as the total actual child care revenues earned af centers that are open at the calcufation date divided by the total potential\nchild care revenue (based upon the center’s undiscounted pre-school fuition rate and the center's fotal ficensed capacity) during the related ime\neriod,\n\" Source: Harris Nesbitf, Education and Training, September 2005.\n\n26\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024459",
