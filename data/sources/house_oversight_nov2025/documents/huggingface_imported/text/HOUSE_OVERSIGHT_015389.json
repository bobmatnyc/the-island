  "text": "caution on his part because | promised if he fucked around with me, |’ d\nlet on that he caught his herpes from Nancy Reagan.”\n\nDigby Diehl concluded, “Harlan’ s only fear is that he’ Il get in a\ncar accident and have to re-live this event. And in the true tradition of\nroasting, that tradition being to talk dirty and mention a big name, thank\nyou all for coming. And join us next week when our guest roaster will be\nMother Teresa.”\n\n| blurted out, “I fucked her.”\n\nThe audience screamed, hooted, stomped, and Robin jumped out of\nhis chair and ran around in a circle. Then he said, “Gandhi is going,\n\n‘Who is this man? He may not get through the gates of heaven for that\nline’ ”\n\nHarlan said, “Thank God Krassner got off one good one.”\n\n| explained, “I guess | just fell into the insult mode.”\n\n“Basically,” said Robert Silverberg, “the roast is a really ugly,\nrepugnant, immature and childish art form. | hate it. And | will only do one\nif Harlan is the target.”\n\nAnd on our way home, Nancy summed up the irony: “A\ncompliment was originally perceived as an insult, and consequently we’ ve\n\nhad an evening of insults which were really compliments.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015389",
