  "text": "\"Antigua is still a very limited economy,\" Mendel said.\n\nAs recently as Friday, the U.S. and Antigua were still talking about settlement options, Nkenge\nHarmon, a spokeswoman for the U.S. government, told me in an email. And, she wrote:\n\n...lf Antigua does proceed with the unprecedented plan for its government to authorize the theft\nof intellectual property, it would only serve to hurt Antigua's own interests. Government-\nauthorized piracy would undermine chances for a settlement. It also would serve as a major\nimpediment to foreign investment in the Antiguan economy, particularly in high-tech industries.\n\nWith warm regards,\n\nCecile\n\nDISCLAIMER: The information contained in this e-mail may be privileged,confidential, and protected from disclosure.
