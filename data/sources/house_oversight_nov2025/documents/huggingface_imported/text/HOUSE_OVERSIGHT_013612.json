That is, Var(E(r)) = = 2.03. From these\n\n=-0.140. We conclude that\n\nthree terms, we compute srs =\n\nrandom than the expected random behavior of a fair coin.\n\nRecall from the last chapter that Karen Selz, Martin Paulus and others have\nshown that various personality types and psychiatric diagnoses are associated with\ncharacteristic deviations of srs from zero. When the winners of the 2002 Annual\nWorld Rock, Paper Scissors Championships held in Montreal Canada were\ninterviewed, they said that sensing their opponent’s characteristic style of deviations\nfrom randomness in what we would call the continuum from maximal to minimal\nentropy determined their successes. We characteristically use all of these measures\nto estimate quantitate the deviation from randomness standard run score, Srs,\nalgorithmic complexity, AC, as well as H; and Hy,, the topological and metric\nentropies.\n\nThe encounter with mystical Absolute Reality, though sought by arduous\ncontemplative and other practice, emerges spontaneously, most often during times\nof apparent mental emptiness, detachment, a state in which rationally instructive\nthought and the choral background of brain voiced, emotion-ladened, commentary\nhave disappeared into the entropic soup of formless silence. It is this indescribable,\nineffable, stillness that we think serves as the psychophysiological anlage of\nmystical experience. The mathematical systems yielding quantitative metaphors,\ndescriptive ideas about dynamical entropic statistical emptiness and form inspire the\nuse of mathematical structures in place of localized lumps in brain meat as\npersonalized icons of doing.\n\nOur wedding of well-defined mathematical objects to metaphoric elements of\n\nmore general nonverbal intuition has a long tradition.
