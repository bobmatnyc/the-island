Then they decided whether the person should be praised for a particular moral act such as\nreturning a wallet, considered responsible for an immoral act such as breaking a promise, helped out for\nmistreatment such as being pushed out of line by a person in a hurry, and punished or rehabilitated for\nwrongful behavior.\n\nHaslam’s results generated a landscape of humanness very much like Gray and Wegner’s. Those\ngroups rated highly in terms of agency, were more likely to be blamed and punished. Those groups rated\nhigh in experience were more likely to be praised, protected, and placed into rehabilitation. Those groups\nperceived as more emotional, compassionate and warm — components of experience — were praised\nmore, whereas those perceived as more civil and rational — components of agency — were praised less.\nOverall, the more a group tilts toward the experience end of the spectrum, the more we see them as moral\npatients, deserving of our care and compassion. The more a group tilts toward the agency end of the\nspectrum, the more we see them as moral agents, having responsibilities and duties to act morally.\n\nHaslam’s findings are not only of great conceptual interest, shaping our understanding of the\ndefining qualities of being human, but also figure into everyday political and legal decision making.\nWhen do we believe a person has the right to vote, drive responsibly, drink alcohol reasonably, and serve\nan adult as opposed to a youth sentence for a crime? In the United States, the age cut off for considering\nthe punishment of a crime under the jurisdiction of a juvenile court proceeding ranges from 16-19 years.\nJuvenile sentences are lighter than adult sentences, and rarely include life in prison or the death penalty.\nThough there is an arbitrariness to these age cut offs, and no good reason why states should differ, the\ndecision to treat youths differently not only maps on to our intuitions but to the attributes that\npsychologists such as Haslam, Gray and Wegner have discovered. Treating an individual as a youth is\nmore likely to trigger the dimension of experience in jury members and thus, more likely to trigger a\nsense that the individual should be protected and given the opportunity to change through rehabilitation.\nThis fits with scientific evidence that an immature brain is a more plastic brain, capable of change. It also\nfits with the evidence that an immature brain is a brain with less self-control and critical reasoning —\nboth components of the agency dimension. These less than fully human qualities on the agency\ndimension, balanced by more qualities on the experience dimension, provide youths with an automatic\nentry ticket into the arena of moral patients.\n\nMoving outside of the arena of moral patienthood and into that of moral agency requires a change\nin perception. It requires us to see individuals as acting responsibly, controlling temptation, and\nunderstanding the distinction between right and wrong. It is for these reasons that our legal system, and\nthe courts that carry out its principles, must consider psychological differences. Classifying individuals\nas adults or juveniles drags with it a massive psychology that is biased toward responsibility, blame and\n\npunishment on the one hand and protection, intervention, and rehabilitation on the other. The same biases\n\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 92\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012838",
