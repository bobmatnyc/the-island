  "text": "Felony rioting is defined in D.C. law by at least five people who use “tumultuous and violent conduct of the\nthreat thereof” to cause “serious bodily harm” and instigate more than $5,000 in property damage.\n\nSix local officers were injured by protesters during Trump’s big day. The glass windows of several businesses\nwere shattered in downtown D.C. including Bank of America, McDonald’s and Starbucks.\n\nAll of the people who have already been charged were released on their own recognizance and given their next\ncourt appearance dates.\n\nAt least one of those arrested was a Vocativ journalist covering the protests, and he was defended by heavy-\nhitter and former White House attorney Kathryn Ruemmler, Buzzfeed reported.\n\nThis email may contain material that is confidential, privileged and/or attorney work product for the sole use of\nthe intended recipient.
