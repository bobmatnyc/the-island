Jeffrey

Just got off the phone with Vinit.
DB stopped marketmaking OTC oil options - for short dated I'd go for exch traded - better liquidity and lower
transaction costs in and out.

My central scenario - Kerry Lavrov meeting Friday will be a bust and the Crimea referendum this weekend
will result in "yes" given the 59pct ethic Russian makeup. Sunday/ Monday sanction rhetoric from ranging
from g8 expulsion to Iran-style bank embargo is raised a notch. Russia follows with more threats of counter-
sanctions. My sense is the Obama 5m of 696m SPR release is to show Merkel and co he will step in. He needs
to because there are 8 small European and Baltic countries that rec 70%+ of their gas from Russia. Germany
gets 30%.

Cross asset correlations outside of the US are increasing past few days - eg copper and the Turkish lira hourly

charts are on top of each other past 4 days. I'm worried there is a 30-40pct(?) chance of a hard risk off move in
markets in first half of next week - more focused on European equities, copper, EM FX (Turkey, ZAR, Ruble

etc) than SPX. In that scenario oil is way up.
