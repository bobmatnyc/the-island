  "text": "Insurance premiums have increased significantly in the past and may increase in the future because of\nmarket conditions in the insurance business generally, conditions in the child care industry more\nparticularly or KLC's situation specifically. KLC cannot be certain of the cost or coverage it will obtain with\nreplacements of existing policies, which will depend on the factors described above.\n\n6.1.16 Factors beyond the Company’s control, such as economic conditions, may\nadversely affect the demand for child care services\n\nDemand for child care services is subject to fluctuations in general econemic conditions, and the\nCompany's revenues depend, in part, on the number of working mothers and working single parents who\nrequire child care services. Recessionary pressure on the economy, and a consequent reduction in the\ngeneral labor force, may adversely impact the Company because out-of-work parents tend to stop using\nchild care services. In addition, certain demographic trends which are favorable to the Company's\nbusiness, including the increasing percentage of mothers in the workforce and the growth in population of\nchildren of the age needing child care, as well as trends in the preference of working parents and\nemployers for center based child care, may not continue. Other factors beyond the Company's control\ncould adversely affect demand, such as terrorism, natural disasters and epidemics.\n\nChildren attending KLC’s facilities are generally enrolled on a weekly basis. Accordingly, any change in\neconomic conditions or other external factors affecting demand will impact us more quickly than\nbusinesses with longer contractual periods.\n\n6.1.17 Aloss or reduction of government funding for child care assistance programs or\nfood reimbursement programs could adversely affect KLC\n\nFederal and state child care assistance programs accounted for approximately 20% of KLC's revenues\nduring the one year period ended December 31, 2005. These funds are primarily from the Child Care\nand Development Block Grant and At Risk Programs, which are designed to assist low-income families\nwith child care expenses and are administered through various state agencies. Although additional\nfunding for child care may be available for low income families as part of welfare reform and the\nreauthorization of the Child Care and Development Block Grant and At Risk Programs, KLC may not\nbenefit from any such additional funding.\n\nKLC is eligible to participate in the Child and Adult Care Food Program, or CACFP, which provides\nreimbursement for meals and snacks that meet certain USDA approved nutritional guidelines. Centers\ncan qualify to participate in the CACFP by meeting one of two tests: 25% or more of the enrolled students\nreceive child care assistance funding or 25% or more of the center's customers have household incomes\nthat are at or below state specified Income levels. Reimbursement is calculated based on the percentage\nof the center's customers thai fall into a “free” or \"reduced\" income category established by the state.\n\nFederal or state child care assistance programs may not continue to be funded at current levels,\nparticularly with large budget deficits putting pressure on discretionary spending programs. In addition,\nmany states have recently experienced fiscal problems and have reduced or may in the future reduce\nspending on social services. A termination or reduction in funding of child care assistance programs\ncould have a material adverse effect on KLC's business.\n\nAdverse changes to the national or local economies may result in an increase in the number of families\neligible for child care assistance. In order to compensate for such increases, state or jocal governments\nhave in the past, and may in the future, increased parent co-payments required under such programs or\nchange the eligibility requirements to reduce the number of families eligible to participate in such\nprograms. An increase in the required parent co-payments may discourage parents from sending their\nchildren to KLC's centers, An increase in required parent co-payments also increases KLC's exposure to\nthe risk of non-payment by these parents.\n\nIn addition, states which reduce funding for child care may be unable to qualify to receive funds under the\nTemporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF, program. Such states may utilize funds under the\n\n51\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024484",
