  "text": "exception: temperate to tropics)—it is Mexicans and people further south who are coming\ninto the US, not Canadians and Eskimos. So Trump is erecting a barrier against\nDarlington’s Rule—migration is always tropics outward. Africa is the center of the\ntropics in the entire globe. Before that it was part of Gondwanaland (Africa, South\nAmerica, Antarctic) but it was the center of that super-continent, and therefore most\n\ntropical section, so Darlington’s rule held back then, as we know from fossils.\n\nBTW it is striking that there is strong evidence that selection from parasites has\nbeen increasing over the past 40,000 years with an acceleration of positive selection to a\nstriking degree—before agriculture and animal husbandry which added further\nacceleration associated with orders of magnitude (5 Or 6) increases in density. There are\n“signatures” that genes show of recent strong positive selection, basically comparing\nneutral sites (change in DNA has no effect on structure of associated protein) with non-\n\nneutral sites and seeing if the latter evolve while the former show a random walk.\n\nAnd what are the chief “selected variants”? Parasite-resistant genes.\n\nNow these are automatically selected when density increases because parasites LOVE\ndensity--consider people packed in a room breathing on each other, or water-born\nparasites traveling quickly to others, or vector-borne parasites, e.g. malaria--if one in ten\nhumans are sick but widely dispersed a mosquito biting the sick person rarely passes on\nthe Plasmodium but if dense, every tenth person gives it to the mosquito who quickly\n\npasses it on\nLikewise parasites like mobility--which increases density of contacts--so Haitians acquired\n\nHIV-1 because their middle class served as the middle class of emerging French-speaking\n\nAfrican nations with high HIV, and they brought back the disease with them when they\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025144",
