Thrift theory makes the opposite\nprediction @—1 and g—>0. The point is to compare simultaneous changes in\nacceleration and thrift, and then find the long-term average of these simultaneous\nobservations, rather than compare long-term changes in the first place. If free\ngrowth is right, they will prove uncorrelated. That is exactly what the charts and\ntables show whenever data are available. Acceleration is as likely to coincide with\n\nunthrift, meaning increase in consumption rate C/K, as with thrift.\n\nDivision of (A9.1) by acceleration was not essential to the logic. It added the\n\nconvenience of index numbers totaling unity.\n\nThe test should be as fine-grained as practical. If the Piketty-Zucman website\nshowed quarterly or monthly data revealing any two of r , f and g,I would have\n\naveraged the largest number of shortest periods. What I try to compare is ex ante\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011145",
