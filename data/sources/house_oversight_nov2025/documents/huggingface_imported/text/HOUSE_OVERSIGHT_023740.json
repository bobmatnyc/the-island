In school, teach usually means helping the stu-\ndent to know something that the teacher told him. Milo doesn’t know\nabout that definition of teaching yet since he hasn’t been to school,\nbut, unfortunately, he soon will.\n\nI have been thinking about teaching for more than 50 years. First\nI thought about it when my father said that was what I was going to\nbe. Then I thought about it as I watched my teachers teach me and, no\nless important, watched my father teach me.\n\nMy father eventually retired from his civil service job and became\na junior high school teacher in Harlem. He loved his new job and, I\nhave to assume, became a good teacher. I say it that way because he\nwas certainly not a good teacher for me, at least not when he thought\nhe was trying to teach me. I remember him trying to teach me algebra\nand it making no sense to me whatever. I remember him teaching me\nsports and I mostly think of him as being totally frustrated with my\ninability to perform as well as he had hoped. (Being a jock was a big\nthing to my father.)\n\nI did fine in algebra without his help and, in fact, became a math\nmajor in college. But, as I look back at it, my father was my first and\nbest teacher. Why do I say this after all the bad things I have just said?\nBecause my father was at his best when he wasn’t teaching but was\njust saying what was on his mind and arguing. He often talked about\nhistory because he liked history. And when he talked about history\nand I asked questions, he became a good Socratic teacher. He forced\nme to think and question in our discussions. The conversations were\noften very heated but also were a highlight of my intellectual life at\nthat time. My father didn’t teach me anything except how to think.\nThat’s better than algebra, actually. For this I am grateful.\n\nSo, I thought about teaching then and I thought about it again\nwhen I went to college. As part of my father’s conversations with\nme about life, he talked a great deal about his own experiences. His\nmother sent him to New York City to live with his aunt in Brooklyn\nand to go to college. He was 15 and had, until that time, spent his\nentire life on a farm/hotel run by his parents in upstate New York.\nHe was unprepared for the city, had no money, missed his family,\nand had no idea why he wanted to go to college at all. Did I mention\nthat he was 15? He had graduated first in his class (a class of 16, I\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023740",
