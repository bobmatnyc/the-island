  "text": "54 3 A Patternist Philosophy of Mind\n\nThis degree is called the pattern intensity of P in X. It quantifies the extent to which P\nis a pattern in X. Supposing that F(P) = X, then the first factor in the definition equals 1,\nand we are left with only the second term, which measures the degree of compression obtained\nvia representing X as the result of P rather than simply representing X directly. The greater\nthe compression ratio obtained via using P to represent X, the greater the intensity of P as a\npattern in X. The first time, in the case F(P) #4 X, adjusts the pattern intensity downwards to\naccount for the amount of error with which F(P) approximates 4 X. If one holds the second\nfactor fixed and thinks about varying the first factor, then: The greater the error, the lossier\nthe compression, and the lower the pattern intensity.\n\nFor instance, if one wishes one may take c to denote algorithmic information measured on\nsome reference Turing machine, and F(X) to denote what appears on the second tape of a\ntwo-tape Turing machine ¢ time-steps after placing X on its first tape. Other more naturalistic\ncomputational models are also possible here and are discussed extensively in Appendix 1 of\n[Goe06a].\n\nDefinition 2 The structure of X € M is the fuzzy set Stx defined via the membership\nfunction\nXstx(P) =e\n\nThis lets us formalize our definition of “mind” alluded to above: the mind of X as the set\nof patterns associated with X. We can formalize this, for instance, by considering P to belong\nto the mind of X if it is a pattern in some Y that includes X. There are then two numbers\nto look at: .% and P(Y|X) (the percentage of Y that is also contained in X). To define the\ndegree to which P belongs to the mind of X we can then combine these two numbers using\nsome function f that is monotone increasing in both arguments. This highlights the somewhat\narbitrary semantics of “of” in the phrase “the mind of X.” Which of the patterns binding X to\nits environment are part of X’s mind, and which are part of the world? This isn’t necessarily\na good question, and the answer seems to depend on what perspective you choose, represented\nformally in the present framework by what combination function f you choose (for instance if\nf(a,b) = a™b?” then it depends on the choice of 0 <r < 1).\n\nNext, we can formalize the notion of a “pattern space” by positing a metric on patterns, thus\nmaking pattern space a metric space, which will come in handy in some places in later chapters:\n\nDefinition 3 Assuming M is a countable space, the structural distance is a metric dst\ndefined on M via\n\ndst(X,Y) =T(xstx,Xsty)\nwhere T is the Tanimoto distance.\nThe Tanimoto distance between two real vectors A and B is defined as\n7 A-B\nAl? + (|B? -— A: B\n\nand since M is countable this can be applied to fuzzy sets such as Stx via considering the\nlatter as vectors. (As an aside, this can be generalized to uncountable M as well, but we will\nnot require this here.)\n\nT(A, B)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012970",
