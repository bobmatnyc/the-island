If the MRS in fitness\ndid not equal that in preferences, then the isograms of the fitness function F would cross those of\nthe utility function U, as shown in the figure. There would then exist consumption bundles, X and\nY, such that X is preferred to Y although Y confers the higher fitness. This preference ordering\ncannot be evolutionarily stable because a mutation that reversed the preference between X and Y\nwould be favored by selection.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011158",
