The Syrian uprisings may have already deepened\nthe sectarian divide in Lebanon, raising once more the specter of civil\nwar and making more difficult the task of forming a new government,\na job President Michel Suleiman has entrusted to the Tripoli notable,\nNajib Mikati. If Syria were overrun with internal strife, Hezbollah\nwould be deprived of a valuable ally -- no doubt to Israel's great\nsatisfaction.\n\nMeanwhile, Turkey is deeply concerned by the Syrian disturbances:\nDamascus has been the cornerstone of Ankara's ambitious Arab\npolicy. Turkey-Syria relations have flourished in recent years as\nTurkey-Israel relations have grown cold. Prime Minister Recep\nTayyip Erdogan and his foreign minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, have\nactively sought to mediate local conflicts and bring much-needed\nstability to the region by forging close economic links. One of their\nbold projects is the creation of an economic bloc comprising Turkey,\nSyria, Lebanon, and Jordan -- already something of a reality by the\nremoval of visa requirements as well as by an injection of Turkish\ninvestment and technological know-how. A power struggle in Syria\ncould set back this project; and regime change in Damascus would\nlikely put a serious dent in further Turkish initiatives.\n\nTurkey's loss, however, may turn out to be Egypt's gain. Freed from\nthe stagnant rule of former President Hosni Mubarak, Cairo is now\nexpected to play a more active role in Arab affairs. Instead of\ncontinuing Mubarak's policy, conducted in complicity with Israel, of\npunishing Gaza and isolating its Hamas government, Egypt is\nreported to be pushing for a reconciliation of the rival Palestinian\nfactions, Hamas and Fatah. If successful, this could help defuse the\ncurrent dangerous escalation of violence between Israel on the one\nside and Hamas and still more extreme Gaza-based Palestinian\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030034",
