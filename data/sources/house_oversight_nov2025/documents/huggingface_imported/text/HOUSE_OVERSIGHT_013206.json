So one must seek approximations. Toward this end\nwe have embodied OpenCogPrime in non-player characters in video game style virtual worlds,\nand carried out preliminary experiments embodying OpenCogPrime in humanoid robots. These\nare reasonably good options but they have limitations and lead to subtle choices: what kind of\ngame characters and game worlds, what kind of robot environments, etc.?\n\nOne conclusion we have come to, based largely on the considerations in Chapter 11 on\ndevelopment and Chapter 9 on the importance of environment, is that it may make sense to\nembed early-stage proto-AGI and AGI systems in environments reminiscent of those used for\nteaching young human children. In this chapter we will explore this approach in some detail:\nemulation, in either physical reality or an multiuser online virtual world, of an environment\nsimilar to preschools used in early human childhood education. Complete specification of an\n“AGI Preschool” would require much more than a brief chapter; our goal here is to sketch the\nidea in broad outline, and give a few examples of the types of opportunities such an environment\nwould afford for instruction, spontaneous learning and formal and informal evaluation of certain\nsorts of early-stage AGI systems.\n\nThe material in this chapter will pop up fairly often later in the book. The AGI Preschool\ncontext will serve, throughout the following chapters, as a source of concrete examples of the\nvarious algorithms and structures. But it’s not proposed merely as an expository tool; we are\nmaking the very serious proposal that sending AGI systems to a virtual or robotic preschool is\nan excellent way — perhaps the best way — to foster the development of human-level human-like\nAGI.\n\n16.1.1 Contrast to Standard AI Evaluation Methodologies\n\nThe reader steeped in the current AI literature may wonder why it’s necessary to introduce a\nnew methodology and environment for evaluating AGI systems. There are already very many\ndifferent ways of evaluating AI systems out there ... do we really need another?\n\nCertainly, the AI field has inspired many competitions, each of which tests some particu-\nlar type or aspect of intelligent behavior. Examples include robot competitions, tournaments of\ncomputer chess, poker, backgammon and so forth at computer olympiads, trading-agent compe-\ntition, language and reasoning competitions like the Pascal Textual Entailment Challenge, and\nso on. In addition to these, there are many standard domains and problems used in the AI liter-\nature that are meant to capture the essential difficulties in a certain class of learning problems:\nstandard datasets for face recognition, text parsing, supervised classification, theorem-proving,\nquestion-answering and so forth.\n\nHowever, the value of these sorts of tests for AGI is predicated on the hypothesis that the\ndegree of success of an AI program at carrying out some domain-specific task, is correlated\nwith the potential of that program for being developed into a robust AGI program with broad\nintelligence. If humanlike AGI and problem-area-specific “narrow AI’ are in fact very different\nsorts of pursuits requiring very different principles, as we suspect, then these tests are not\nstrongly relevant to the AGI problem.\n\nThere are also some standard evaluation paradigms aimed at AI going beyond specific tasks.\nFor instance, there is a literature on “multitask learning\" and “transfer learning,” where the\ngoal for an AT is to learn one task quicker given another task solved previously [Car97, TM95,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013206",
