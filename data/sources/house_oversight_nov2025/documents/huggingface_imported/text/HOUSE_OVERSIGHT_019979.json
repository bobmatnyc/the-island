  "text": "CPAC\n\nn February 23, a 75-degree day in Washington, the president woke up complaining\n() about an overheated White House. But for once, the president’s complaints were not\nthe main concern. The excited focus in the West Wing was organizing a series of car pools\nout to the Conservative Political Action Conference, the annual gathering of conservative\nmovement activists, which had outgrown the accommodations of Washington hotels and\nmoved to the Gaylord Resort on Maryland’s National Harbor waterfront. CPAC, right of\nright-of-center and trying to hold steady there, ambivalent about all the conservative\nvectors that further diverged from that point, had long had an uncomfortable relationship\nwith Trump, viewing him as an unlikely conservative, if not a charlatan. CPAC, too, saw\nBannon and Breitbart as practicing an outré conservatism. For several years Breitbart had\nstaged a nearby competitive conference dubbed “The Uninvited.”\n\nBut the Trump White House would dominate or even subsume the conference this year,\nand everybody wanted to turn out for this sweet moment. The president, set to speak on\nthe second day, would, like Ronald Reagan, address the conference in his first year in\noffice, whereas both Bushes, wary of CPAC and conservative activists, had largely\nsnubbed the gathering.\n\nKellyanne Conway, a conference opener, was accompanied by her assistant, two\ndaughters, and a babysitter. Bannon was making his first official pubic appearance of the\nTrump presidency, and his retinue included Rebekah Mercer, the pivotal Trump donor and\nBreitbart funder, her young daughter, and Allie Hanley, a Palm Beach aristocrat,\nconservative donor, and Mercer friend. (The imperious Hanley, who had not met Bannon\nbefore, pronounced him “dirty” looking.)\n\nBannon was scheduled to be interviewed in the afternoon session by CPAC chairman\nMatt Schlapp, a figure of strained affability who seemed to be trying to embrace the\nTrump takeover of his conference. A few days before, Bannon had decided to add Priebus\nto the interview, as both a private gesture of goodwill and a public display of unity—a sign\nof a budding alliance against Kushner.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019979",
