EDWARDS and PAUL G.\nCASSELL,\nCASE NO.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs,\nvs.\nALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,\nDefendant.\n/\nPLAINTIFFS/COUNTERCLAIM DEFENDANT EDWARDS AND\nCASSELL'S RESPONSE TO DERSHOWITZ'S MOTION TO DETERMINE\nCONFIDENTIALITY OF COURT RECORDS\nPlaintiffs/Counterclaim Defendants Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, by and\nthrough their undersigned attorneys, hereby file this response to Dershowitz's Motion to\nDetermine Confidentiality of Court Records. The records at issue are not confidential, and so the\nCourt should deny Dershowitz's motion in its entirety.\nThe court records at issue are three court filings by attorneys Edwards and Cassell\nin which they recite their client's (Mr. Virginia Giuffre's) allegations that she was sexually\nabused by Dershowitz. These records are hardly \"confidential\" in this defamation case,\nwhere the parties have claims and counterclaims about these sexual abuse\nAllegations. Rather, these records are an important part of this case, since they not only\nsupport the conclusion that Dershowitz abused Ms. Giuffre, but also indisputably establish\nEdwards and Cassell's strong basis for filing the allegations on her behalf. Moreover,\ncontrary to assertions made in Dershowitz's motion, these documents have never been\nfound to be \"confidential\" by any other court. And Dershowitz has repeatedly referred to\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 2 of 20\nthese documents, not only in defamatory statements broadcast worldwide, but also in his\npleadings before this Court and in recent depositions. Indeed, Dershowitz said in his\nmedia interviews that he wants \"everything to be made public\" and implied that Edwards\nand Cassell had something to hide. Accordingly, Dershowitz has failed to carry his heavy\nburden to justify sealing these presumptively-public documents.\nI. DERSHOWITZ HAS NOT JUSTIFIED SEALING ALLEGED\nDEFAMATORY RECORDS THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO THIS\nDEFAMATION CASE.\nIn his motion, Dershowitz never recounts the heavy burden that he must carry to seal the\nrecords at issue. To be sure, Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420 allows for the sealing\nof \"confidential\" materials. But the Rule begins by recounting the overarching principle that\n\"[t]he public shall have access to all records of the judicial branch of government, except as\nprovided below.\" Fla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(a). This rule is a codification of the Florida\nSupreme Court's admonition that a \"a strong presumption of openness exists for all court\nproceedings. A trial is a public event, and the filed records of court proceedings are public\nrecords available for public examination.\" Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, Inc., 531\nSo.2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988) (emphasis added). In light of this presumption of openness, \"[t]he\nburden of proof in [closure] proceedings shall always be on the party seeking closure.\" Id. To\nobtain a sealing order, the party seeking sealing must carry a \"heavy burden.\" Id.\nRemarkably, Dershowitz fails to acknowledge these well-settled principles. More\nimportant, he even fails to cite (much less discuss) the limited substantive exceptions to this\ngeneral principle of access — and which specific exception he believes applies to this\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 3 of 20\ncase. Accordingly, it is impossible for Edwards and Cassell to respond with precision to his\nmotion.\nThe exceptions that might arguably be in play in this case permit records to be maintained\nas confidential in order to:\n(i)\n(ii)\n(iii)\n(iv)\n(v)\n(vi)\nPrevent a serious and imminent threat to the fair, impartial, and orderly\nadministration of justice;\nProtect trade secrets;\nProtect a compelling governmental interest;\nObtain evidence to determine legal issues in a case;\nAvoid substantial injury to innocent third parties;\nAvoid substantial injury to a party by disclosure of matters protected by a\ncommon law or privacy right not generally inherent in the specific type of\nproceeding sought to be closed;\nComply with established public policy set forth in the Florida or United\nStates Constitution or statutes or Florida rules or case law ....\nFla. R. Jud. Admin. 2.420(c)(9) (codifying the holding in Barron v. Florida Freedom\nNewspapers, Inc., 531 So.2d 113 (Fla. 1988)). The only exception that seems to even arguably\napply here is exception vi, which itself specifically provides that confidentiality is appropriate\nonly where disclosure is \"not generally inherent in the specific type of proceeding sought to be\nclosed\" (emphasis added). Of course, this lawsuit is a defamation action — involving\na defamation claim by Edwards and Cassell and a defamation counterclaim by\nDershowitz. Disclosure, discussion, and debate about the defamatory statements at issue lies at\nthe heart of the case. Accordingly, disclosure of these materials is \"inherent\" in the case itself.\nThe principle that defamatory material in a defamation case cannot be sealed is recognized\nin Carnegie v. Tedder, 698 So.2d 1310 (2d DCA 1997). Carnegie involved a claim and\ncounterclaim between two parties (Carnegie and Tedder), one of whom alleged that disclosure of\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 4 of 20\nthe materials in the records would be harmful to his professional\nreputation. Carnegie recited subsection vi's restriction on release of materials involving a\nprivacy right, but noted that \"statements Tedder alleged were defamatory and damaging were\nallegations in Carnegie's counterclaim for which she seeks damages.\nThese matters were not peripheral to the lawsuit; they were inherent to it.\" Id. at 1312. Of\ncourse, exactly the same principle applies here: sexual abuse allegations filed by attorneys\nEdwards and Cassell for their client Ms. Virginia Giuffre are not peripheral to this lawsuit — they\nare inherent to it.\nTo see how \"inherent\" the sexual abuse allegations are to this lawsuit, the Court need\nlook no further than Dershowitz's counterclaim in this case. Count I of Dershowitz's\nCounterclaim (styled as \"False Allegations in the Joinder Motion) contends that Edwards and\nCassell should pay him damages because they \"filed a pleading in the Federal Action titled 'Jane\nDoe #3 and Jane Doe #4's Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 for Joinder in Action' . . . .\" Dershowitz\nCounterclaim at 11 14. Dershowitz's Counterclaim then goes on to quote at length from the\nJoinder Motion. His counterclaim contains, for example, this paragraph recounting the\nallegations:\nThe Joinder Motion then goes on to allege — without any supporting evidence — as\nfollows:\nOne such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to\nhave sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan\nDershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's and well-known criminal defense\nattorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with\nDershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida\nbut also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 5 of 20\nIslands. In addition to being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other\nminors, Dershowitz was an eye-witness to the sexual abuse of many other\nminors by Epstein and several of Epstein's coconspirators. Dershowitz would\nlater play a significant role in negotiating the [Non-Prosecution Agreement] on\nEpstein's behalf. Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that\nprovided immunity from federal prosecution in the Southern District of Florida\nnot only to Epstein, but also to \"any potential coconspirators of Epstein.\" Thus,\nDershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a provision that provided\nprotection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for sexually\nabusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity wouldhave been\ncontroversial if disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein's\ndefense team) and the Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret\nfrom all of Epstein's victims and the general public, even though such secrecy\nviolated the Crime Victims' Rights Act.\nDershowitz Counterclaim at 1115 (quoting Joinder Motion at 4).\nRemarkably, having quoted at length from the Joinder Motion in his Counterclaim in this\ncase, Dershowitz now seeks to have that very same language from the Joinder Motion deemed\n\"confidential\" and sealed. Compare Counterclaim at ¶15 (block quotation above) with Motion to\nDetermine Confidentiality, Exhibit A at 4 (composite exhibit with proposed \"confidential\"\ndocument that includes paragraph beginning \"[o]ne such powerful individual that Epstein forced\nthen-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan\nDershowitz, a close friend of Epstein's . . . .\"). Dershowitz cannot come before this Court and\nfile a counterclaim seeking damages from Edwards and Cassell for alleged defamatory\nstatements and then ask to have those very same statements placed under seal as\n\"confidential.\" See Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers, 531 So.2d at 119 (\"although\ngenerally protected by one's privacy right, medical reports and history are no longer protected\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 6 of 20\nwhen the medical condition becomes an integral part of the civil proceeding, particularly when\nthe condition is asserted as an issue by the party seeking closure\" (emphasis added)).\nH. JUDGE MARRA'S ORDER IN HIS CASE DOES NOT REQUIRE THAT\nTHE RECORDS BE SEALED IN THIS CASE.\nDershowitz also appears to contend that Judge Marra's order striking some of the\nmaterials from the records at issue somehow requires that these stricken materials be kept\nconfidential in this case. Dershowitz's argument misunderstands both the scope of Judge\nMarra's order and its effect in this case. His argument rests on a truncated — and misleading --\ndescription of the events surrounding Judge Marra's ruling striking certain documents. A more\ncomplete description makes clear that Judge Marra has not determined the documents are\nsomehow \"confidential\" even in the federal Crime Victims' Rights Act case — much less in this\nseparate state defamation action.\nEdwards and Cassell filed the federal case pro bono on behalf of two young women who\nwere sexually abused as underage girls by Dershowitz's close personal friend — Jeffrey\nEpstein. In 2008, Edwards and Casell filed a petition to enforce the rights of \"Jane Doe No. 1\"\nand \"Jane Doe No. 2\" under the Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771, alleging\nthat the Government had failed to provide them rights with regard to a plea arrangement it was\npursuing with Epstein. Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736\n(S.D. Fla.). In the course of that case, on October 11, 2011, the victims filed discovery requests\nwith the Government, including requests specifically seeking information about Dershowitz,\nPrince Andrew, and others. Further efforts from the Government to avoid any discovery\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 7 of 20\nfollowed (see generally Docket Entry or \"DE\" 225-1 at 4-5), ultimately leading to a further\nCourt ruling in June 2013 that the Government should produce documents. DE 189. The\nGovernment then produced about 1,500 pages of largely irrelevant materials to the victims (DE\n225-1 at 5), while simultaneously submitting 14,825 pages of relevant materials under seal to the\nCourt. The Government claimed that these pages were \"privileged\" for various reasons,\nattaching an abbreviated privilege log.\nWhile these discovery issues were pending, in the summer of 2014, Edwards and Cassell,\ncontacted Government counsel to request their agreement to add two additional victims to the\ncase, including Ms. Virginia Giuffre (who was identified in court pleadings as \"Jane Doe No.\n3\"). Edwards and Cassell sought to have her added to the case via stipulation, which would have\navoided the need to include any detailed facts about her abuse. Weeks went by and the\nGovernment — as it had done on a similar request for a stipulation to add another victim — did not\nrespond to counsel's request for a stipulation. Finally, on December 10, 2014, despite having\nhad four months to provide a position, the Government responded by email to counsel that it was\nseeking more time, indicating that the Government understood that victims' counsel might need\nto file a motion with the court on the matter immediately. DE 291 at 3-5. Rather than file a\nmotion immediately, victims' counsel waited and continued to press the Government for a\nstipulation. See id. at 5. Finally, on December 23, 2014 — more than four months after the initial\nrequest for a stipulated joinder into the case — the Government tersely indicated its objection,\nwithout indicating any reason: \"Our position is that we oppose adding new petitioners at this\nstage of the litigation.\" See DE 291 at 5.\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 8 of 20\nBecause the Government now contested the joinder motion, Edwards and\nCassell prepared a more detailed pleading explaining the justification for granting the\nmotion. One week after receiving the Government's objection, on December 30, 2014, Ms.\nGiuffre (i.e., Jane Doe No. 3) and Jane Doe No. 4 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion)\nseeking to join the case. DE 279 and DE 280. (Note: DE 280 is the first of the three documents\nDershowitz seeks to have declared \"confidential\" in this case.) Uncertain as to the basis for the\nGovernment's objection, the motion briefly proffered the circumstances that would qualify\nthe two women as \"victims\" eligible to assert rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. 3771(e)\n(defining \"crime victim\" protected under the Act). With regard to Ms. Giuffre, the motion\nindicated that when she was a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz and Prince\nAndrew (among others) for sexual purposes. Jane Doe No. 3 stated that she was prepared to\nprove her proffer. See DE 280 at 3 (\"If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe No. 3 would prove\nthe following .... \"). The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3's\nparticipation was relevant to the case, including the pending discovery issues regarding\nDershowitz and Prince Andrew. DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining several reasons participation of new\nvictims was relevant to existing issues).\nAfter the motion was filed, various news organizations published articles about\nit. Dershowitz also made numerous media statements about the filing, including calling Jane\nDoe No. 3 \"a serial liar\" who \"has lied through her teeth about many world\nleaders.\" http ://vvww cnn . co m/2015/01/06/us/dershowi tz-sex -all e gati on/. Dershowitz also\nrepeatedly called Edwards and Cassell \"two sleazy, unprofessional, disbarable lawyers.\" Id. On\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 9 of 20\nJanuary 5, 2015, Dershowitz filed a motion to intervene to argue to have the allegations\nstricken. DE 282. Dershowitz also argued that Ms. Giuffre had not provided a sworn affidavit\nattesting to the truth of her allegations. On January 21, 2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a\nresponse for Ms. Giuffre and Jane Doe No. 4. DE 291. (Note: This is the second of the three\ndocuments Dershowitz seeks to have kept under seal here.) The response enumerated nine\nspecific reasons why Ms. Giuffre's specific allegations against Dershowitz were relevant to the\ncase, including the fact that Ms. Giuffre needed to establish that she was a \"victim\" in the case,\nthat pending discovery requests concerning Dershowitz-specific documents were pending, and\nthat Dershowitz's role as a defense attorney in the case was highly relevant to the motive for the\nGovernment and defense counsel to conceal the plea deal from the victims. DE 291 at 17-26 &\nn.17. The response included a detailed affidavit from Ms. Giuffre about the sexual abuse she had\nsuffered from Epstein, Dershowitz, and other powerful persons. DE 291-1. On February 6,\n2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a further pleading (and affidavit from Ms. Giuffre, see DE 291-\n1) in support of her motion to intervene. (Note: this affidavit is the third of the three documents\nDershowitz seeks to have declared confidential.)\nOn April 7, 2015, Judge Marra denied Ms. Giuffi-e's motion to join the case. Judge\nMarra concluded that \"at this juncture in the proceedings\" details about the sexual abuse she had\nsuffered was unnecessary to making a determination \"of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4\nshould be permitted to join [the other victims'] claim that the Government violated their rights\nunder the CVRA. The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does engaged in\nsexual activities are impertinent to this central claim (i.e., that they were known victims of Mr.\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 10 of 20\nEpstein and the Government owed them CVRA duties), especially considering that the details\ninvolve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government.\" DE 324 at 5 (emphasis\nin original). While Judge Marra struck those allegations, he emphasized that \"Jane Doe 3 is free\nto reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof, should [the victims]\ndemonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a matter presented\nfor the Court's consideration. Judge Marra then denied Ms. Giuffre's motion to join the case,\nbut allowed her to participate as trial witness: \"The necessary 'participation' of [Ms. Giuffre] ...\nin this case can be satisfied by offering ... properly supported — and relevant, admissible, and\nnon-cumulative — testimony as needed, whether through testimony at trial ... or affidavits\nsupported in support [of] the relevancy of discovery requests.\" DE 324 at 8 (emphasis\ndeleted). In a supplemental order, Judge Marra stated that the victims \"may re-refile these\ndocuments omitting the stricken portions.\" DE 325. The victims have recently refiled the\ndocuments.\nIn light of this history, Dershowitz is flatly incorrect when he asserts that \"Judge Marra's\nOrder appropriately precludes the unredacted documents from being re-filed in this case on the\npublic docket.\" Confidentiality Motion at 3. To the contrary, the Order specifically permits\nfactual details about Dershowitz's sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre to be presented in regard to\npertinent matters in the federal CVRA case. And certainly nothing in Judge Marra's Order could\nrender those documents confidential in this state defamation case, where the central issues swirl\naround Edwards and Cassell's good faith basis for filing the allegations. Indeed, the order is not\nbinding in any way in this case, because it is res judicata only as to Ms. Giuffre (the moving\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 11 of 20\nparty in that case), not as to her attorneys Edwards and Cassell. See Palm AFC Holdings, Inc. v.\nPalm Beach County, 807 So.2d 703 (4th DCA 2002) (\"In order for res judicata to apply four\nidentities must be present: (1) identity of the thing sued for; (2) identity of the cause of action;\n(3) identity of persons and parties; and (4) identity of the quality or capacity of the persons for or\nagainst whom the claim is made.\").\nIII. EDWARDS AND CASSELL WILL BE PREJUDICED IF THEY ARE\nBARRED FROM QUOTING FROM THE RECORD WHILE\nDERSHOWITZ IS PERMITTED TO FREELY REFER TO THEM\nWHENEVER HE FINDS IT CONVENIENT.\nDershowitz is also incorrect when he asserts that no prejudice will befall Edwards and\nCassell if the records are placed under seal. To the contrary, placing the documents under seal\nwould permit Dershowitz to continue to misrepresent and distort what is contained in those\nrecords while preventing Edwards and Cassell from correcting those misrepresentations.\nDershowitz has repeatedly referred to details in the records when he has found it convenient to\ndo so — treating the records as not confidential in any away. One clear example comes from\nDershowitz's recent deposition, where he gratuitously injected into the record a reference to a\nportion of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit about him watching Ms. Giuffre perform oral sex on\nEpstein. And then, having injected that gratuitous reference into the record, he proceeded to try\nto rebut the reference with confidential settlement discussions — but did so by mispresenting what\nanother attorney (David Boies) had said during the settlement discussions. So that the Court may\nhave the full flavor of the exchange, the narrow question to Dershowitz (by attorney Jack\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 12 of 20\nScarola) and Dershowitz's extended answer are quoted in full — including Dershowitz's\nreference to the oral sex allegation that he now argues this Court should treat as \"confidential\":\nQ. [Y]ou [are] aware that years before December of 2014, when the\nCVRA pleading was filed, that your name had come up repeatedly in\nconnection with Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, correct? . . .\nA. Let me answer that question. I am aware that never before 2014,\nend of December, was it ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any\nway inappropriately with regard to Virginia [Giuffre], that I ever\ntouched her, that I ever met her, that Ihad ever been with her. I was\ncompletely aware of that. There had never been any\nallegation. She claims under oath that she told you that secretly in\n2011, but you have produced no notes of any such conversation.\nYou, of course, are a witness to this allegation and will be deposed\nas a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an entirely false\nallegation that she told you in 2011 that she had had any sexual\ncontact with me. I think she's lying through her teeth when she\nsays that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any such\ninformation.\nBut if she did tell you that, she would be absolutely, categorically\nlying. So I am completely aware that never, until the lies were put\nin a legal pleading at the end of December 2014, it was\nnever alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia Roberts.\nI know that it was alleged that I was a witness to Jeffrey Epstein's\nalleged abuse and that was false. I was never a witness to any of\nJeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you, something\nthat you have falsely denied. And I stand on the record. The record\nis clear that I have categorically denied I was ever a witness to\nany abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing anybody.\nAnd -- and the very idea that I would stand and talk to Jeffrey\nEpstein while he was receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts,\nwhich she swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so preposterous,\nthat even David Boies said he couldn't believe it was true.\nMS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm not going to allow you to reveal\nany conversations that happened in the context of a settlement discussion.\nTHE WITNESS: Does she have standing?\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 13 of 20\nMS. McCAWLEY: I have a standing objection and, I'm objecting again. I'm\nnot going to\nTHE WITNESS: No, no, no. Does she have standing in this deposition?\nMR. SCOTT: Let's take a break for a minute, okay?\nTHE WITNESS: I'm not sure she has standing.\nMR. SCAROLA: Are we finished with the speech?\nMR. SCOTT: No. If he --\nMR. SCAROLA: I'd like him to finish the speech so that we can get to my\nquestion\nand then we can take a break.\nA. So the question -- the answer to your question is --\nMR. SIMPSON: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Please don't\ndisclose something that she has a right to raise that objection if she wants to.\nMR. SCOTT: Exactly.\nDeposition of Alan Dershowitz (Oct. 15, 2015) at 93-95 (attached as Exhibit 1); see\nalso Deposition of Alan Dershowitz (Oct. 16, 2016) (attached as Exhibit 2) (also containing\ndiscussion of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit).\nThe Court should be aware that within approximately two hours of this exchange, Ms.\nMcCawley (David Boies' law partner) released a statement on his behalf, which stated that\nDershowitz was misrepresenting what happened: \"Because the discussions that Mr. Boies had\nwith Mr. Dershowitz were expressly privileged settlement discussions, Mr. Boies will not, at\nleast at this time, describe what was actually said. However, Mr. Boies does state that Mr.\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 14 of 20\nDershowitz description of what was said is not true.\" Statement of Ms. McCawley on Behalf of\nDavid Boies (Oct. 15, 2015).\nMore broadly, the Court can readily see from this passage how Dershowitz is willing to\ninject into the record a part of Ms. Giuffre's affidavit whenever it serves his purpose — and,\nindeed, to characterize the part of the affidavit as \"preposterous.\" But then he asks this Court to\nplace the underlying affidavit under seal, so that the Edwards and Cassell stand accused having\nfiled a \"preposterous\" affidavit without anyone being able to assess the validity of Dershowitz's\nattack.\nDershowitz has referred to the court records that he now wishes to have the Court declare\nconfidential not only in his deposition, but also in his widely-broadcast media attacks on\nEdwards and Cassell. For example, Dershowitz appeared on the British Broadcasting\nCorporation (the BBC) and was asked about the allegations:\nWell, first of all they were made in court papers that they don't even ask for a hearing\nto try to prove them. They put them in court papers in order to immunize themselves\nfrom any consequences from a defamation suit. The story is totally made\nup, completely out of whole cloth.\nI don't know this woman. I was not at the places at the times. It is part of a pattern of\nmade up stories against prominent people and world leaders. And the lawyers in\nrecent statement challenged me to deny the allegations under oath. I am doing that. I\nam denying them under oath, thus subjecting me to a perjury prosecution were I not\ntelling the truth. I am now challenging them to have their client put these charges\nunder oath and for them to put them under oath. I am also challenging them to repeat\nthem outside of the context of court papers so that I can sue them for defamation. . . .\nAnd I will prove beyond any doubt not only that the story is totally false, but it was\nknowingly false: that the lawyers and the client conspired together to create a false\nstory. That is why I am moving for their disbarment in challenges to be provided to\nthe disciplinary committee.\nBBC Radio 4 - Sarah Montague (Jan. 3, 2015) (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02g7qbc).\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 15 of 20\nSimilarly, Dershowitz appeared on NBC's Today Show the morning after Edwards and\nCassell made a filing for Ms. Giuffre, to say that the Edwards and Cassell — and Ms. Giuffre —\nwere all \"lying\" in the court documents:\nQuestion from Savannah Guthrie: In legal papers from the lawyers, they say you've\nhad, in fact, the opportunity to be deposed.\nAnswer from Alan Dershowitz: They're lying. They're lying.\nQuestion: They show letters in which they offered to depose you.\nAnswer: And they didn't show my letters in response saying, (a), if you ask me about\nmy legal relationship with Epstein and I'll be happy to answer. . . . And I responded\nthat I would be happy to be deposed if you could give me any indication that I would\nbe a relevant witness . . . . They will be proved — all of them [i.e., Cassell, Edwards,\nand Ms. Giuffre] — to be categorically lying and making up this story. And it will be a\nterrible thing for rape victims. . . . We [Epstein and Dershowitz] had an academic\nrelationship. I was never in the presence of a single, young, underaged\nwoman. When I was with him, it was with prominent scientists, prominent\nacademics. And they're just — again — lying about this. I never saw him doing\nanything improper. I was not a participant. I was not a witness.\nToday Show, Jan. 22, 2015 (emphases added).\nAs another example, in Miami Herald, Dershowitz called the Joinder Motion that he\nseeks to have sealed the sleaziest legal document I have ever seen. They [Edwards and\nCassell] manipulated a young, suggestible woman who was interested in money. This is a\ndisbarrable offense, and they will be disbarred. They will rue the day they ever made this false\ncharge against me\" — i.e., Edwards and Cassell will \"rue the day\" they ever filed the Joinder\nMotion. Miami Herald (Jan. 3, 2015).\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 16 of 20\nMost remarkably, Dershowitz took the public airwaves to represent that he wanted all of\nthe information surrounding the allegations to \"be made public,\" while implying that Edwards\nand Cassell had something to hide. For example, on the BBC he claimed that he\nwanted\"everything to be made public\":\nQ: Would you encourage that it now be made public?\nA: Of course, of course. I want everything to be made public. I want\nevery bit of evidence in this case to be made public. I want every\nallegation to be made public. I want to know who else she's accused of\nthese horrible crimes. We know that she accused Bill Clinton of being on\nJeffrey Epstein's island and participating in sex orgy with underage\ngirls. The records of the Secret Service will prove that President Clinton\nnever set foot on that island. So that she lied. Now it's possible to have a\ncase of mistaken identification with somebody like me. It's impossible to\nhave a case of mistaken identification with Bill Clinton.\nMy only feeling is that if she has lied about me, which I know to an\nabsolute certainty she has, she should not be believed about anyone\nelse. She's lied clearly about me, she's lied clearly about Bill\nClinton. We know that. We know that she's lied about other public\nfigures, including a former prime minister and others who she claims to\nhave participated in sexual activities with. So I think it must be presumed\nthat all of her allegations against Prince Andrew are false as well.\nI think he [Prince Andrew] should clear the air as well.\nIf you're squeaky clean and if you have never done anything like this, you\nmust fight back with all the resources available to you. And that's what I\nwill do. I will not rest or stop until the world understands no only that I\nhad nothing to do with any of this, but that she deliberately, with the\nconnivance of her lawyer, lawyers, made up this story willfully and\nknowingly.\nBBC Radio 4 - Sarah Montague (Jan. 3, 2015) (http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02g7qbc).\nIn another widely-broadcast interview on CNN, Dershowitz implied that there is no\nevidence supporting the allegations against him:\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 17 of 20\nAsk them [Edwards and Cassell] if they have any evidence . . . . They're doing it for\nmoney. She's getting money for having sold her story. She wants to sell the book.\nThey're trying to get into this lawsuit. They see a pot of gold at the end of the\nrainbow. They're [Edwards and Cassell] prepared to lie, cheat, and steal. These are\nunethical lawyers. This is Professor Cassell who shouldn't be allowed near a\nstudent. This is Professor Cassell, who is a former federal judge, thank God he no\nlonger wears a robe. He is essentially a crook. He is essentially somebody who's\ndistorted the legal profession. . . . Why would he charge a person with a\nsterling reputation for 50 years on the basis of the word alone of a woman who is\nserial liar, who has lied about former Prime Ministers, former Presidents, has lied\ndemonstrably.\nCNN Live (with Hala Gorani) (January 5, 2015). Of course, by placing \"the evidence\" in this\ncase under seal, Dershowitz will be free to continue to try and insinuate that Edward and Cassell\n— and their client, Ms. Giuffre — had no evidence supporting the allegations against him, even\nthough a mountain evidence strongly support Ms. Giuffre 's allegations. See Deposition of Paul\nCassell (Oct. 16, 2015) at 61-117 (Exhibit 3); see also Depo of Pual Cassell (Oct. 17, 2015)\n(Exhibit 4).\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court should deny Defendant/Counterclaim Plaintiff Alan Dershowitz's motion to\nplace documents regarding Ms. Giuffre's allegations against him under seal.\nI HEREBY CERTIFY that a true and correct copy of the foregoing was sent via E-Serve\nto all Counsel on the attached list, this 25f-‘' day of November, 2015.\n/s/ Jack Scarola\nJack Scarola\nFlorida Bar No.: 169440\nAttorney E-Mail(s): jsxasearcylaw.com and\nmep@searcylaw.com\nPrimary E-Mail: scarolateamasearcylaw.com\nSearcy Denney Scarola Barnhart & Shipley, P.A.\n2139 Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard\nWest Palm Beach, Florida 33409\nPhone:(561) 686-6300\nFax:(561) 383-9451\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nEdwards and Cassells Response to Dershowitz's Motion to Determine Confidentiality of Court Records\nPage 18 of 20\nSEAN D.

DERSHOWITZ\nVOLUME 1\nPages 1 through 179\nThursday, October 15, 2015\n9:31 a.m. - 4:13 p.m.\nCole Scott & Kissane\n110 Southeast 6th Street\nFort Lauderdale, Florida\nStenographically Reported By:\nKimberly Fontalvo, RPR, CLR\nRealtime Systems Administrator\n93\n1 people that abused Virginia?\n2 A. I told you I never asked her the question. 11:36:21\n3 Q. Are you aware that years before December 11:36:48\n4 of 2014, when the CVRA pleading was filed, that your\n5 name had come up repeatedly in connection with\n6 Jeffrey Epstein's abuse of minors, correct?\n7 MR. SCOTT: Objection, form, overly broad. 11:37:16\n8 A. Let me answer that question. I am aware 11:37:17\n9 that never before 2014, end of December, was it\n10 ever, ever alleged that I had acted in any way\n11 inappropriately with regard to Virginia Roberts,\n12 that I ever touched her, that I ever met her, that I\n13 had ever been with her. I was completely aware of\n14 that. There had never been any allegation.\n15 She claims under oath that she told you 11:37:48\n16 that secretly in 2011, but you have produced no\n17 notes of any such conversation. You, of course, are\n18 a witness to this allegation and will be deposed as\n19 a witness to this allegation. I believe it is an\n20 entirely false allegation that she told you in 2011\n21 that she had had any sexual contact with me. I\n22 think she's lying through her teeth when she says\n23 that. And I doubt that your notes will reveal any\n24 such information.\n25 But if she did tell you that, she would be 11:38:24\n94\n1 absolutely, categorically lying. So I am completely\n2 aware that never, until the lies were put in a legal\n3 pleading at the end of December 2014, it was never\n4 alleged that I had any sexual contact with Virginia\n5 Roberts.\n6 I know that it was alleged that I was a 11:38:46\n7 witness to Jeffrey Epstein's alleged abuse and that\n8 was false. I was never a witness to any of Jeffrey\n9 Epstein's sexual abuse. And I wrote that to you,\n10 something that you have falsely denied. And I stand\n11 on the record. The record is clear that I have\n12 categorically denied I was ever a witness to any\n13 abuse, that I ever saw Jeffrey Epstein abusing\n14 anybody.\n15 And -- and the very idea that I would 11:39:18\n16 stand and talk to Jeffrey Epstein while he was\n17 receiving oral sex from Virginia Roberts, which she\n18 swore to under oath, is so outrageous, so\n19 preposterous, that even David Boies said he couldn't\n20 believe it was true.\n21 MS. McCAWLEY: I object. I object. I'm 11:39:40\n22 not going to allow you to reveal any\n23 conversations that happened in the context of a\n24 settlement discussion.\n25 THE WITNESS: Does she have standing? 11:39:46\n95\n1\n2\n3\n4\nMS. McCAWLEY: I have a standing objection\nand, I'm objecting again. I'm not going to\nTHE WITNESS: No, no, no. Does she have\nstanding in this deposition?\n11:39:47\n11:39:49\n5 MR. SCOTT: Let's take a break for a 11:39:51\n6 minute, okay?\n7 THE WITNESS: I'm not sure she has 11:39:54\n8 standing.\n9 MR. SCAROLA: Are we finished with the 11:39:57\n10 speech?\n11 MR. SCOTT: No. If he -- 11:39:58\n12 MR. SCAROLA: I'd like him to finish the 11:39:59\n13 speech so that we can get to my question and\n14 then we can take a break.\n15 A. So the question -- the answer to your 11:40:02\n16 question is --\n17 MR. SIMPSON: Wait a minute. Wait a 11:40:04\n18 minute. Wait a minute. Please don't disclose\n19 something that she has a right to raise that\n20 objection if she wants to.\n21 MR. SCOTT: Exactly. 11:40:13\n22 THE WITNESS: Okay. 11:40:14\n23 MR.

Truth has many, many meanings and is a 1 transcript of the interview? wed like to see\n2 continuum. The Supreme Court has held that 2 it.\n3 rhetorical hyperbole cannot be the basis, for 3 MR. SCAROLA: That's exactly what I gave\n4 example, of perjury prosecutions or generally of a 4 you, the photocopy.\n5 defamation prosecution. 5 MR. SCOTT: Were doing it right now.\n6 So it depends on the context. You might 6 Maybe we can move on and come back then.\n7 just look at the dictionary and probably get a 7 MR.

Yes, I do.\n5 A. Why don't we just read back my answer. 5 Q. Do you recall having been interviewed on\n6 BY MR. SCAROLA: 6 CNN Tonight by Don Lemon in early January of 2015,\n7 Q. Because I didn't understand it, so I would 7 where you spoke about matters that have become the\n8 like you to try to give us a direct response to that 8 subject of this litigation?\n9 question if you're able to. 9 A. Yes, I do.\n10 A. I will repeat exactly what I said. A 10 Q. Did you make the following statement\n11 rhetorical means verbal and hyperbole means some 11 during the course of that interview: \"As to the\n12 exaggeration of the facts for political or other 12 airplanes, there are manifests that will prove\n13 reasons, but generally it is truthful in a literal 13 beyond any doubt that I was never on a private\n14 sense but perhaps -- it all depends on context. 14 airplane with this woman or any other underage\n15 And if you tell me the context in which I 15 OW?\n16 used it, I will be happy to describe what I meant in 16 MR. SCOTT: You need to see the\n17 that context. But I don't think you can really 17 transcript?\n18 answer a question about what two words put together 18 THE WITNESS: No. No.\n19 mean without understanding the context. 19 A. That is a truthful statement. I would\n20 Q. Okay. Well, we're going to talk about 20 repeat it right now. I've reviewed the manifests.\n21 some context. 21 First, I know I was never on the airplane\n22 Do you recall having been interviewed on 22 with any underage woman. I know that for a fact. I\n23 CNN Tonight on January 5, 2015? 23 have absolutely no doubt in my mind about that. And\n24 A. I have no current recollection of -- 24 the records that I have reviewed confirm that.\n25 MR. SCOTT: Do you have a copy of the 25 They have Virginia Roberts on a number of\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n3 (Pages 185 to 188)\n1 airplane flights with Jeffrey Epstein. They have me\n2 on a number of flights, none -- let me emphasize,\n3 none within the relevant time period, none within\n4 the relevant time period. That is, there are no\n5 manifests that have me on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane\n6 during the time that Virginia Roberts claims to\n7 have -- falsely claims to have had sex with me.\n8 So, yes, not only recall making that\n9 statement, but I repeat it here today. And it is\n10 absolutely true. And it just confirms what I know,\n11 and that is that Virginia Roberts made up the entire\n12 story.\n13 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n14 Q. Your statement --\n15 MR. SCOTT: What page are you reading\n16 from?\n17 MR. SCAROLA: Page 5.\n189\n18 Q. Your statement was that you were never on\n19 a private airplane with this woman, which I assume\n20 was a reference to Virginia Roberts, correct?\n21 A. It is, yes.\n22 Q. Or any other underage girl?\n23 A. That's right.\n24 Q. All right. How many times --\n25 A. Well, let me be very clear. I have no\n191\n1 to the transcription, the official transcription of\n2 that testimony, was that, quote:\n3 \"Let me emphasize that the manifests that\n4 do exculpate me do not show me flying with Virginia\n5 Roberts, they do not show me flying with any young\n6 women.\"\n7 That was the testimony you gave under\n8 oath. Do you stand by that testimony today?\n9 A. The manifests that I saw corroborate my\n10 own memory -- my own memory is as clear as could\n11 be -- that I never saw any inappropriately aged,\n12 underaged women on any airplane to my knowledge that\n13 were visible to me at any time that l flew. That is\n14 my testimony, yes.\n15 Q. Well, that's not a response to the\n16 question that I asked. Is it your testimony today\n17 that you never flew on a private airplane with,\n18 quote, \"any young women\"?\n19 MR. SCOTT: Objection, form.\n20 A. By young women, I obviously meant in that\n21 context underage women. And underage women in the\n22 context of sexuality. And, yes, I -- I stand by\n23 that statement.\n24 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n25 Q. All right. So your -- your clarification\n190\n192\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nidea who was in the front cabin of the airplane with\nthe pilots. Obviously what I intended to say and\nwhat I say here now is l never saw an underaged\nperson on an airplane.\nNow, when l -- when l flew with Jeffrey\nEpstein to the launch, my recollection is that there\nmay have been a couple on the plane with their child\nwho was going to see the launch. But that was\ncertainly not the context in which I made the\nstatement.\nI never saw any underage, young person who\nwould be the subject or object of any improper\nsexual activities. Had l seen Jeffrey Epstein ever\nin the presence of an underage woman in a context\nthat suggested sexuality, l would have, A, left the\nscene; B, reported it; and, C, never had any further\ncontact with Jeffrey Epstein.\nQ. You have also made the statement that you\nwere never on a private airplane with any underage\nwomen or any young women, correct?\nA. The context was underage women in a sexual\ncontext. If it was a -- you know, a four-year-old\nchild being carried by her mother, that would not be\nincluded in what I intended to say.\nQ. Your sworn testimony yesterday, according\n1 of your earlier testimony is that you never saw any\n2 young women in a sexual context?\n3 A. That's not clarification. I think that's\n4 what I initially said. That's what 1 initially\n5 intended. And that's the way any reasonable — any\n6 reasonable person would interpret what my original\n7 testimony was. So I don't believe my original\n8 testimony required any clarification.\n9 Q.

SCAROLA: I want to know whether the\nlast name is spelled the same or it isn't\nspelled the same on the flight log marked as an\nexhibit and on the photographs. That's a very\ndirect question. It calls for a very direct\nyes or no response.\nAnd this witness has demonstrated a clear\nrefusal to respond directly to direct\nquestions, which will result, when we resume\nthis deposition, in our requesting that the\nCourt appoint a special master so that this\ndeposition doesn't take two weeks to complete.\nMR.

Thank you very much, sir.\n8 Now, that flight log also shows you flying\n9 repeatedly in the company of a woman named Tatiana,\ncorrect?\nA. I've only seen one reference to Tatiana on\nNovember 17.

And if you recall, months\n2 ago I suggested a special master for this\n3 deposition, for your clients' depositions and\n4 for Virginia Roberts' and your response to me\n5 was: I'll consider it, I won't pay for it. If\n6 your client wants to pay for it -- so basically\n7 you blew me off.\n8 So, I appreciate you finally come around.\n9 And your clients.\n10 MR. SCAROLA: Your client's misconduct has\n11 clearly convinced me, having now considered it,\n12 that it is absolutely necessary.\n13 MR. SCOTT: Okay. Now --\n14 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n15 Q. So now could 1 get an answer to my\n16 question --\n17 MR. SCOTT: Now that we have --\n18 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n19 Q. -- whether the last name on the flight log\n20 is spelled exactly the same way as the last name in\n21 the photographs?\n22 MR. SCOTT: Now that all the lawyers'\n23 speeches arc done, read the question back and\n24 the witness will answcr it.\n25 MR. SCAROLA: I will repeat the question.\n1 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n2 Q. Did you state during the same interview,\n3 the CNN Don Lemon interview: \"She has said that\n4 Bill Clinton was with tier at an orgy on Jeffrey's\n5 island\"?\n6 A. I did state that, yes.\n7 Q. Was that statement intended as fact,\n8 opinion, or was it intended as rhetorical hyperbole?\n9 MR. SCOTT: Do you understand the\n10 question?\n11 THE WITNESS: Yes, I do.\n12 A. It was a statement based on what I\n13 believed were the facts at the time I said them.\n14 Various newspapers and blogs had placed\n15 Bill Clinton on, quote, \"orgy island\" on -- in the\n16 presence of Jeffrey Epstein when there were orgies.\n17 And at the time I made that statement, I had a\n18 belief that she had accused Bill Clinton of\n19 participating or being -- as being a part of or an\n20 observer or -- or a witness or a participant in\n21 orgies on what was called Jeffrey Epstein's orgy\n22 island. That was my state of belief, honest belief\n23 at the time I made that statement.\n24 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n25 Q. Yes, sir. And what I want to know is what\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n7 (Pages 201 to 204)\n205 207\n1 the source of that honest belief was? Identify any 1 Clinton on orgy island, things of that kind. I\n2 source that attributed to Virginia Roberts the 2 would be happy to provide them for you. I don't\n3 statement that Bill Clinton was with her at an orgy 3 have them on the top of my head.\n4 on Jeffrey's island. 4 Q. There's a big difference between saying\n5 A. We can provide you about, I think, 20 5 that Bill Clinton was on Jeffrey's island and saying\n6 newspaper articles and blogs which certainly raise 6 that Bill Clinton was at an orgy on Jeffrey's\n7 the implication that Bill Clinton had improperly 7 island, isn't there?\n8 participated in sexual activities on the island 8 MR. SCOTT: Objection --\n9 either as an observer or as a participant. The 9 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n10 issue was raised on Sean Hannity's program. The 10 Q. Do you recognize a distinction between\n11 headlines in various British media had suggested 11 those statements?\n12 that. 12 MR. SCOTT: Form.\n13 Its my belief that Virginia Roberts 13 A. I don't think that distinction was clearly\n14 intended to convey that impression when she was 14 drawn by the media.\n15 trying to sell her story to various media, which she 15 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n16 successfully sold her story to in Britain, that she 16 Q. I'm asking whether you recognize the\n17 wanted to keep that open as a possibility. 17 distinction?\n18 And then when I firmly declared, based on 18 A. Oh, I -- I certainly recognize a\n19 my research, that Bill Clinton had almost certainly 19 distinction.\n20 never been on that island, she then made a firm 20 Q. Oh, so --\n21 statement that she -- which was a -- which was a 21 A. Let me finish. I certainly recognize a\n22 perjurious statement, a firm perjurious statement 22 distinction between Bill Clinton being on the\n23 saying that although Bill Clinton had been with her 23 island, which I believe she perjuriously put in her\n24 on the island and had had dinner with her, the 24 affidavit, and Bill Clinton participating actively\n25 perjurious statement was that Bill Clinton had been 25 in an orgy. I also think its a continuum.\n206 208\n1 on the island with her. 1 And there is the possibility, which I\n2 The lie was that she described in great 2 don't personally believe to be true, that he was on\n3 detail a dinner with Bill Clinton and two underaged 3 the island. There was the possibility, which I\n4 Russian women who were offered to Bill Clinton for 4 don't believe to be true, that he was on the island\n5 sex but that Bill Clinton turned down. 5 when orgies were taking place. There was the\n6 So she then put in her affidavit that 6 possibility that he was on the island and observed\n7 although -- perjuriously, although she had seen Bill 7 an orgy, and there was the possibility that he was\n8 Clinton on that island, she then stated that she had 8 on the island and participated in an orgy.\n9 not had sex with Bill Clinton. To my knowledge, 9 Newspapers picked up those stories. I'll\n10 that was -- to my knowledge at least, that was the 10 give you an example of a newspaper that actually\n11 first time she stated that -- that she not had sex 11 said that that she had placed or that I was on the\n12 with Bill Clinton. She had certainly implied, or at 12 island and -- that I participated in an orgy along\n13 least some of the media had inferred from her 13 with Stephen Hawkings [sic], the famous physicist\n14 statements that she may very well have observed Bill 14 from Cambridge University, that was a newspaper\n15 Clinton in a sexually compromising position. 15 published in the Virgin Islands, which falsely\n16 So, when 1 made that statement to Don 16 claimed that I was at an orgy with Stephen Hawkings.\n17 Lemon, I had a firm belief, based on reading 17 So, many newspapers were suggesting,\n18 newspaper accounts and blogs, that it was true. 18 implying, and I inferred from reading those\n19 Q. Can you identify a single newspaper that 19 newspapers that that's what she had said to the\n20 attributed to Virginia Roberts the statement that 20 media.\n21 Bill Clinton was with her at an orgy on Jeffrey's 21 If I was wrong about that based on\n22 island? 22 subsequent information, I apologize. But I\n23 A. I think there -- I don't have them in my 23 certainly, at the time I said it, believed it and\n24 head right now. But I do recall reading headlines 24 made the statement in good faith in the belief that\n25 that talked about things like, sex slave places 25 it was an honest statement.\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888) 811-3408\n8 (Pages 205 to 208)\n209 211\n1 Q.

So that my characterization of her as\n23 carried these false stories, I received phone calls 23 about 25 years old is absolutely correct.\n24 and I teamed about -- I learned about her encounter 24 And the implication that you sought to\n25 with the criminal justice system. 25 draw by showing me those pictures was not only\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n10 (Pages 213 to 216)\n217 219\n1 demonstrably false, but you could have easily 1 she has a history of lying, knowing that she is\n2 discovered that the implication you were drawing was 2 easily suggestible, and they basically pressured\n3 demonstrably false by simply taking one second and 3 her, according to my sources, into including me when\n4 Googling her name as my wife did. 4 she didn't want to include me, because by including\n5 BY MR. SCAROLA: 5 me, they could make a claim, false as it was, could\n6 Q. And so at 25 years old, she wasn't a young 6 make a false claim that a person who negotiated the\n7 woman? 7 NPA was also criminally involved with her.\n8 A. She was not the kind of woman that I was 8 They also lied -- lied unethically and\n9 describing as underage. She was a mature, serious, 9 unprofessionally by saying that I negotiated that\n10 I think I said in my public statements a model.

And that was one of the bases on which I was\n14 terms, a serious person. 14 certain that they had engaged in unprofessional,\n15 I always saw her dressed when I saw her -- 15 disbarrable and unethical conduct by including that\n16 I saw her maybe on two or three occasions, dressed 16 provision, as well as including a provision that\n17 appropriately. She was a serious adult worker and I 17 Prince Andrew was included because he, Prince\n18 think you insult and demean her when you suggest 18 Andrew, pressured a United States attorney to try to\n19 that anything other than that she was a serious 19 get a good deal for Jeffrey Epstein.\n20 adult when she flew on that airplane. 20 That is so laughable. How any lawyer\n21 Q. You were asked on the occasion of that 21 could put that in a pleading, it doesn't pass even\n22 same Don Lemon CNN interview what possible motive 22 the minimal giggle test. And I'm embarrassed for\n23 the attorneys, Brad Edwards and Paul Cassell, could 23 Professor Cassell that he would have signed his name\n24 have had to have identified you in the pleading that 24 to a pleading that alleges that Prince Andrew would\n25 was filed in the Crime Victim's Rights Act case. 25 pressure the United States attorney for the Southern\n218 220\n1 Do you remember that? 1 District of Florida into giving Jeffrey Epstein a\n2 A.

Did you state the following in that same\n19 MR. SCOTT: Objection, form. Go ahead if 19 interview: \"So they,\" referring to Bradley Edwards,\n20 you can answer it. 20 Paul Cassell and Virginia Roberts, \"sat (town\n21 A. There were multiple motives. One of the 21 together, the three of them, these two sleazy,\n22 motives was crassly financial. They were trying to 22 unprofessional disbarrable lawyers\" --\n23 line their pockets with money. But as I also said, 23 A. Uh-huh, uh-huh.\n24 and I said this over and over again, they profiled 24 Q. -- \"they said\" --\n25 me. They sat down with their client, knowing that 25 MR.

SCOTT: The transcripts we consider to\n8 A. Yes, and I just repeated it under oath. I 8 be work product. If you make a request to\n9 believe that to be the case. 1 think that's exactly 9 produce, we'll provide them.\n10 what happened. And I think that my source has 10 MR. SIMPSON: Just for completeness, they\n3.1 corroborated that. 11 were also after your discovery request.\n12 By the way, can I add at this point -- I 12 MR. SCOTT: Request to produce, we'll\n13 don't mean to distract you, but I think the record 13 consider providing them.\n14 would be more complete if I indicated that I did get 14 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n15 a phone call last night from Michael, who told me 15 Q. Is there an entry in any privilege log\n16 that he had received numerous phone calls and texts 16 that identifies these allegedly privileged work\n17 from Virginia Roberts trying to persuade her not to 17 product documents?\n18 talk to me or cooperate with me and offering the\n18 MR. SIMPSON: We will -- the lawyers will\n19 help of a lawyer.\n19 address the document production issues. But\n20 And I also -- although you didn't ask the 20 two things, Mr. Scarola, first, they postdate\n21 question, Mr. Scarola, I think for completeness and 21 your request and you have said several times\n22 fullness, I do want to say that you asked me whether\n22 there's no duty to supplement. And second,\n23\n24\n25\nor not I knew about what could be taped and what\ncouldn't be taped. I did tape record some of what\nVirginia Roberts [ sic.] told me, with her\n23\n24\n25\nthey're work product.\nMR. SCAROLA: Well, sir, if they postdated\na full and complete production, which we are\n222 224\n1 permission, and I have those tape recordings. 1 now told they do not, then you wouldn't be\n2 Q. Well, you're getting a little bit 2 obliged to supplement the production that had\n3 overexcited, Mr. Dershowitz, because you never tape 3 already been completed. But it is not the date\n4 recorded anything that Virginia Roberts told you. 4 of the request that matters, it is the date of\n5 A. Did I say Virginia Roberts? 5 the production that matters.\n6 Q. You misspoke. 6 And what we're now being told is there are\n7 A. I misspoke. You wouldn't know that. But, 7 allegedly highly relevant transcripts of a\n8 in fact, let me be clear. 8 telephone conversation that occurred months ago\n9 I tape recorded, with her permission, 9 when the last production that we received,\n10 Rebecca's statements to me about what Virginia 10 which we are told still is not complete,\n11 Roberts had told her. And I just want to make sure 11 occurred approximately two weeks ago.\n12 that for completeness, even though you didn't ask 12 So, there's no privilege log entry.\n13 the question yesterday, that's part of the record. 13 There's no production of these documents. And\n14 Q. Well, I actually did ask the question and 14 there is clearly a very significant discovery\n15 my recollection is that you said you didn't even 15 violation if, in fact, such documents exist.\n16 think about tape recording anything -- 16 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to debate it\n17 MR. SCOTT: No, that's not accurate. You 17 here, Mr. Scarola, but your assertions are not\n18 never asked that. 18 accurate.\n19 BY MR. SCAROLA: 19 MR. SCAROLA: All right. There also was a\n20 Q. But can you tell us, please, did you turn 20 subpoena duces tecum that was responded to\n21 over those tape recordings in the discovery that you 21 tomorrow -- I'm sorry, yesterday. Can you tell\n22 were required to make in this case? 22 us whether the documents that are now being\n23 A. The discovery -- these events occurred 23 described are included in response to the\n24 after April of 2015.

SIMPSON: The flash drive is the same 1 A. I know what you know because I'm a logical\n2 as the document production. 2 person and I know that Virginia -- I know that\n3 MR. SCAROLA: So the answer is no, they're 3 Virginia Roberts repeatedly called this -- this\n4 not there; is that correct? 4 woman and her husband, repeatedly text her, and\n5 MR. SIMPSON: Correct. 5 knows her name. And you and Virginia Roberts'\n6 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. And what's the 6 lawyers are operating in privity here. You're\n7 explanation for that? 7 whispering to each other, you're passing notes. You\n8 MR.

Thank you. 10 have to do is ask Sigrid McCawley and she'll tell\n11 BY MR. SCAROLA: 11 you her name. Pm sure you know her name. And if\n12 Q. Which conversation with Rebecca did you 12 you don't know her name, it's because you haven't\n13 tape record? 13 asked.\n1.4 A. I tape recorded a conversation with her 14 Q. Okay. Well, I'm asking you —\n15 permission where she told me that she was pressured, 15 A. Pm not going to tell you --\n16 she didn't -- where Rebecca told me that Virginia 16 Q. -- and I'm telling you I don't know her\n17 was pressured and that she didn't want to name me 17 name.\n18 but she was pressured to name me, that she had never 18 A. Okay.\n19 previously named me. 19 Q. Okay? As an officer of the court, I am\n20 By the way, I told this to Virginia 20 telling you I don't know her name. And you are\n21. Roberts' lawyer. 21 under oath and obliged to answer material and\n22 MS. McCAWLEY: Objection. To the extent 22 relevant questions, and I want to know what her name\n23 you're going to reveal anything that was said 23 is.\n24 during settlement discussions, I'm moving for 24 MR. SCOTT: I will provide you the name\n25 sanctions, period. We're not doing this today. 25 off the record, but Pm not -- if he feels its\n226 228\n1 Please instruct the witness. 1 inappropriate because of what -- he's not going\n2 MR. SCOTT: Avoid that. We discussed that 2 to answer the question. I will provide you the\n3 yesterday. 3 name.\n4 THE WITNESS: That's fine. 4 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n5 BY MR. SCAROLA: 5 Q. Okay. She has still insisted that her\n6 Q. What was the date of the phone 6 name not be revealed; is that correct?\n7 conversation that you tape recorded? 7 A. Her husband asked me to do whatever I\n8 A. 1 don't recall. But it's on the 8 could not to put her name in front of the press, in\n9 transcript. 9 front of the media.\n10 Q. And does it also reflect that the 10 Q. There's no — there's no one from the\n11 recording is being made with her permission? 11 press here today.\n12 A. Uh-huh. 12 MR. SCOTT: Yeah, but they're going to\n13 Q. That's a yes? 13 order the transcript and they're going to see,\n14 A. Yes. Yes, that's a yes. 14 so that's the same thing. And I've already\n15 Q. What is Rebecca's last name? 15 told --\n16 A. You know Rebecca's last name and she has 16 A. You will have her name in five --\n17 asked me not to reveal it to the press. And so I 17 MR.

SCOTT: And, Jack, if you want to take\n20 know her husband's name, you know her phone number, 20 a break now --\n21 and she has been called. But there's no reason for 21 THE REPORTER: I-Iold on. Hold on,\n22 me to reveal it so that it appears in the press that 22 gentlemen. You can't talk at the same time.\n23 she would be called by newspapers and by the media. 23 MR. SCOTT: Let me do the talking at this\n24 Q. Mr. Dershowitz, how do you know what I 24 point.\n25 know if you haven't told me? 25 THE WITNESS: Please.\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n13 (Pages 225 to 228)\n229 231\n1 BY MR. SCAROLA: 1 more accomplished.\n2 Q. What's her phone number? 2 MR. SCAROLA: Let's take it easy and slow.\n3 A. Her phone number is known to Virginia 3 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n4 Roberts and presumably -- and to Virginia Roberts' 4 Q. How did Michael tell you he knew these\n5 lawyers because she received phone calls from 5 people he didn't speak to were lawyers?\n6 Virginia Roberts' lawyers. So all you have to do is 6 A. He told me that he received a phone call\n7 ask your colleagues and you will get that. But I 7 from Virginia Roberts. That then his wife received\n8 think there's no reason to put her phone number in 8 numerous phone calls and texts from her all through\n9 the public record so that she will receive massive 9 the night. And that they received phone calls as\n10 amounts of phone calls from the media. Seems to me 10 well from her lawyers. One of them had a Miami\n11 that any -- that a judge would try to prevent that 11 phone number.\n12 from happening. I would hope so. And I'm -- you 12 And I don't know how he knew they were\n13 can get the name and the phone number from my lawyer 13 lawyers. But that's what he conveyed to me. All I\n14 as long as it's -- 14 can tell you is what he told me, and I'm telling you\n15 MR. SCOTT: We'll provide that. 15 that.\n16 A. -- done off the record, not so that the 16 Q. Did you ask him for the phone number?\n17 media can see it. 17 A. I did not.\n18 BY MR. SCAROLA: 18 Q. Why not?\n19 Q. You just swore under oath that lawyers 19 A. l didn't think it was appropriate or\n20 contacted Rebecca; is that correct? 20 necessary.\n21 A. I swore under oath that I was told by 21 Q. What was inappropriate about asking for\n22 Michael that lawyers contacted Rebecca, yes. 22 the phone number to find out who was attempting to\n23 Q. Which lawyers? 23 contact this witness?\n24 A. I don't know the answer to that. 24 A. I was not particularly interested in that.\n25 Q. Did you ask him? 25 All I was interested in was getting the truth from\n230 232\n1 A. I did. 1 the witness and trying to prevent her from having a\n2 Q. And he said, I — 2 media barrage that would interfere with their lives.\n3 A. He wouldn't answer that. 3 Q. You told Don Lemon on CNN that the flight\n4 Q. -- refuse to tell you? 4 manifests would exonerate you, prove that you were\n5 A. No, he didn't know the answer to that 5 not in the same place at the same time as Virginia\n6 either because he didn't return the phone calls. He 6 Roberts, correct?\n7 said -- 7 A. That's right. And that's true.\n8 Q. How did he know they were lawyers if he 8 Q. You also told Don Lemon, quote, \"I am\n9 didn't return the phone calls? 9 waiving the statute of limitations or any immunity.\"\n10 A. Because they left messages, presumably. 10 A. That's right.\n11 Q. With names that identified them as 11 Q. You were then subsequently asked to waive\n12 lawyers; is that right? 12 the statute of limitations and refused to, correct?\n13 MR. SCOTT: You're arguing with the 13 A. Absolutely false.\n14 witness -- 14 I waived the statute of limitations by\n15 A. I don't know the answer to that. 15 submitting a statement under oath. Had I not\n16 MR. SCAROLA: No, I'm trying to find out 16 submitted that statement under oath, the statute of\n17 whether there's any logical basis for the 17 limitations would have been long gone. But by\n18 stories that the witness is telling. 18 stating under oath categorically that I did not have\n19 MR. SCOTT: And I think he's trying to 19 any sexual contact with her, I waived the statute of\n20 explain it. And I think he's trying to do it 20 limitations and could be prosecuted for the next\n21 in an easy, slow format. So, you know -- 21 five or so years for perjury in what I said was\n22 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, let's take it 22 false.\n23 easy -- 23 But what I said was true, so I have no\n24 MR. SCOTT: -- if we all take -- if we all 24 fear of any statute of limitations or any criminal\n25 take the tension down here, maybe we can get 25 prosecution. So, yes, I did waive the statute of\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n14 (Pages 229 to 232)\n233 235\n1 limitations, yes. 1 Q. And by dropping the dime on the media when\n2 Q. You refused to waive the statute of 2 they filed it, you intended to convey the message\n3 limitations with regard to sexual crimes, correct? 3 that Paul Cassell and Bradley Edwards intentionally\n4 A. I didn't refuse anything. I didn't feel I 4 generated the focus of press attention on that\n5 had any obligation to respond to you. And I did 5 filing; is that correct?\n6 not. 6 A. Absolutely. Absolutely without any doubt.\n7 Q. So, you were asked to waive the statute of 7 Why else would they have brought Prince Andrew into\n8 limitations with regard to your sexual crimes and 8 this filing? Prince Andrew had no connection to the\n9 you refused to respond? 9 NPA, no relevance at all. But they knew that by\n10 A. I was asked by you, utterly 10 including Prince Andrew, this would drag my name\n11 inappropriately, and what I had said -- and if you 11 into every single newspaper and media outlet in the\n12 check what I said, I said if any reasonable 12 world.\n13 prosecutor were to investigate the case and find 13 It was outrageous for them to do this.\n14 that there was any basis, I would then waive the 14 Particularly because they did so little, if any,\n15 statute of limitations. I didn't waive the statute 15 investigation, which will, of course, be determined\n16 of limitations because you, a lawyer, for two 16 when they're deposed. And -- and --\n17 unprofessional, unethical lawyers asked me to do so, 17 Q. Well, you've already made that\n18 what obligation do I have to respond to you? 18 determination, right?\n19 Q. Well, you have no obligation to respond to 19 MR. SCOTT: Wait.\n20 me at all, Mr. Dershowitz, except now while you arc 20 A. I'm convinced that -- that they did little\n21 under oath and I am asking you questions and I would 21 or no investigation. They never even bothered to\n22 greatly appreciate you responding to the questions 22 call me. That would have been --\n23 that I ask. 23 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n24 MR. SCOTT: I think he's trying. 24 Q. We'll get to that in just a moment.\n25 25 A. -- a simple basic thing.\n234 236\n1 BY MR. SCAROLA: 1 Q. But right now — right now could you\n2 Q. You made the further statement in that 2 please tell us was there anything other than your\n3 same interview, \"They dropped the diine on the media 3 inferring that they must have contacted the media to\n4 when they filed it,\" referring to the CVRA 4 support your conclusion that either Paul Cassell or\n5 pleading -- 5 Brad Edwards did, in fact, alert the media at the\n6 A. Right. 6 time of the filing of this pleading?\n7 Q. — in which were you named? 7 A. Yes.\n8 A. Right. 8 Q. What else besides your inference?\n9 Q. What is the basis for that statement? 9 A. When the BBC came to see me, the BBC\n10 A. The basis for that statement was that the 10 reporter showed me an e-mail from Paul Cassell,\n11 filing was done virtually on the eve of New Year's 11 which urged him, the BBC reporter, to ask me a\n12 on a day that the press was completely dead. And 12 series of questions. So I knew that Paul Cassell\n13 nonetheless, immediately upon the filing, I got a 13 was in touch with the British media and was trying\n14 barrage of phone calls that led me to conclude, and 14 to stimulate and initiate embarrassing questions to\n15 led many, many, many other lawyers who called me to 15 be asked of me.\n16 conclude that obviously somebody tipped somebody off 16 And when I spoke to a number of reporters,\n17 that they didn't just happen to file -- to find in 17 they certainly -- obviously reporters have\n18 the middle of an obscure pleading which didn't even 18 privilege, but they said things that certainly led\n19 have a heading that indicated that I was involved or 19 me to infer that they had been in close touch with\n20 anybody else was involved. 20 your clients or representatives on their behalf.\n21 So, I'm certain that a dime was dropped to 21 Q. What was the date of the e-mail —\n22 somebody saying, by the way, you want an interesting 22 A. I don't know.\n23 story, there's -- Prince Andrew of Great Britain and 23 Q. -- that you referenced in that response?\n24 Alan Dershowitz have been accused of sexual 24 A. I don't know.\n25 misconduct. I still believe that. 25 Q. Well --\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n15 (Pages 233 to 236)\n237 239\n1 A. It was whenever -- I'm not sure I ever saw 1 MR. SCOTT: I think he's answered that\n2 the date. He just quickly showed me the e-mail and 2 twice.\n3 1 quickly looked at it. 3 A. It came after. It came after.\n4 Q. The e-mail that you are referencing, in 4 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n5 fact, occurred after you had begun all of your media 5 Q. Thank you, sir. On January 5, you made\n6 appearances with respect to this filing -- 6 another CNN Live appearance in an interview with\n7 A. Let me be very clear about -- 7 Hala Gorani. Do you recall that?\n8 Q. — didn't it, sir? 8 A. I do not recall the name of the person --\n9 A. Let me be very clear about my media 9 Q. Take a look at the transcript, if you\n10 appearances so that I -- 10 would, please, page 15.\n11 Q. How about just answering the questions? 11 MR. SCOTT: Take a moment to review the\n12 A. Pm trying to answer the question. All of 12 transcript, please, Mr. Dershowitz.\n13 my media appearances -- 13 THE WITNESS: Page 15.\n14 Q. The question is: Did it occur before or 14 MR. SCOTT: Take your time to review that.\n15 after your media -- your media appearances? That 15 A. Yeah, that name is not familiar to me but,\n16 doesn't call for a speech — 16 of course, I remember doing an interview, yes.\n17 A. It came -- 17 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n18 Q. — it calls for before or after. 18 Q. All right, sir. And during the course of\n19 A. It came before some and after some. It 19 that interview, you said: \"There are flight\n20 came, for example, before my appearance on the BBC 20 manifests. They will prove I was never on any\n21 because they showed me the e-mail before they 21 private airplane with any young woman.\" Correct?\n22 interviewed me for the BBC. So some occurred -- it 22 A. Yes.\n23 occurred before some and it occurred after some. 23 Q. Go to page 17, if you would.\n24 Q. All right. So it is your assertion that 24 A. Uh-huh.\n25 this single e-mail that you have made reference to 25 Q. At line 4 of transcript of that same\n238 240\n1 where Paul Cassell says \"asks Dershowitz these 1 interview, you said: \"She made the whole thing up\n2 questions\" occurred before your -- your media 2 out of whole cloth. I can prove it by flight\n3 appearances and after your media appearances; is 3 records. I can prove it by my travel records.\"\n4 that correct? 4 Did you make those statements?\n5 MR. SCOTT: Objection, form, argumentative 5 A. Yes, and they're absolutely true.\n6 and repetitious. 6 Q. Okay. I am going to hand you every flight\n7 A. It occurred before some of the media 7 record that has been produced in connection with\n8 appearances, and it occurred after some of media 8 this litigation.\n9 appearances, yes. 9 A. Uh-huh.\n10 BY MR. SCAROLA: 10 MR. SCAROLA: Could we mark that as the\n11 Q. Did it occur before your first media 11 next composite exhibit, please?\n12 appearances? 12 (Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff\n13 A. My first media appearances came as the 13 Exhibit 6.)\n14 result of phone calls I received from -- 14 MR. SCAROLA: And mark this as the next\n15 Q. That's nonresponsive to my question, sir. 15 composite exhibit, which will be 7.\n16 A. -- newspapers -- 16 MR. SCOTT: These are all the flight\n17 Q. I didn't ask you anything about what your 17 manuals?\n18 first media appearances occurred -- 18 MR. SCAROLA: As far as I know.\n19 A. Yes, you did. 19 MR. SCOTT: Okay.\n20 Q. -- as a result of. I asked you -- 20 MR. SCAROLA: They're the only ones that\n21 MR. SCOTT: Let him ask his question. 21 have been produced in discovery. If there are\n22 BY MR. SCAROLA: 22 more, I'm going to be interested to hear about\n23 Q. -- whether the c-mail that you claimed to 23 it.\n24 have seen was sent before or after your first media 24 (Thereupon, marked as Plaintiff\n25 appearance? 25 Exhibit 7.)\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n16 (Pages 237 to 240)\n241 243\n1 (Discussion off the record.) 1 exonerated by any flight logs that were innocent --\n2 THE WITNESS: What's Number 6 then? I'm 2 that were complete and accurate, of course.\n3 confused, there were two. 3 Q. So you made the public statements\n4 BY MR. SCAROLA: 4 repeatedly that the flight logs would exonerate you\n5 Q. Have you ever seen Exhibit Number 6 5 without having examined the flight logs to see\n6 before? 6 whether they were accurate or not; is that correct?\n7 A. Exhibit Number 6. I don't believe so. It 7 A. Well, I knew -- I knew that --\n8 doesn't look familiar to me. 8 Q. Did you say those things without having\n9 Q. No? 9 examined the flight logs?\n10 A. It does not look familiar to me. 10 A. I said those things having looked at some\n11 Q. Did you bother at any time to review 11 of the flight logs at some point in time. But I\n12 discovery that was produced by Bradley Edwards and 12 knew for sure that the flight logs would exonerate\n13 Paul Cassell responding to requests for information 13 me because I knew I was never on Jeffrey Epstein's\n14 that supported the allegations of Virginia Roberts? 14 plane with Virginia Roberts or any other young\n15 A. I'm not clear what you're asking. 15 underage girls. So, I knew that to an absolute\n16 Q. I want to know — 16 certainty. And I was prepared to say it. I'm\n17 A. In which case? In which case are we 17 prepared to say it again under oath here.\n18 talking? 18 And if your clients had simply called me\n19 Q. This case. This case. 19 and told me they were planning to do this, we\n20 A. Right. 20 wouldn't be here today because I could have shown\n21 Q. Did you ever bother to review the 21 them in one day that it was impossible for me to\n22 discovery produced in this case responding to 22 have had sex with their client on the island, in the\n23 requests for all of the information that supported 23 ranch, on the airplanes, in Palni Beach. And they\n24 their belief in the truthfulness of Virginia 24 would have, if they were decent and ethical lawyers,\n25 Roberts' allegations against you? 25 not filed that.\n242 244\n1 A. I don't know if I reviewed everything. 1 And there are cases, legal ethics cases\n2 But I certainly, in preparation for this deposition, 2 that say that lawyers are obliged to make that phone\n3 reviewed some of the documents that were produced in 3 call. Lawyers are obliged to check if it's easy to\n4 discovery. But I can't say I reviewed them all. 4 check. Lawyers are obliged to, particularly when\n5 Q. Well, having placed such substantial 5 they're making extremely heinous charges against a\n6 emphasis during the course of your public 6 fellow lawyer, do very, very, detailed\n7 appearances on the flight logs exonerating you, it 7 investigations. And they didn't do that in this\n8 would certainly seem logical that one of the things 8 case.\n9 that you would want to review would be all of the 9 Q. I will represent to you that I have handed\n10 available -- all of the available flight logs, 10 you all of the available flight logs produced in the\n11 right? 11 discovery of this case. Could you show me, please,\n12 A. No. 12 which of these flight logs exonerates you?\n13 MR. SCOTT: Objection, argumentative. 13 A. The absence of evidence is evidence of\n14 A. No. 14 absence. None of the flight logs have me on an\n15 BY MR. SCAROLA: 15 airplane with Virginia Roberts. None of the flight\n16 Q. No? 16 logs have me on an airplane during the relevant\n17 A. No. Look, I knew I was never on a plane 17 period of time when Virginia Roberts claims that she\n18 with any underage females under any circumstances. 18 had sex with me in the presence of another woman.\n19 I knew that. I knew that as certainly as I'm 19 So, the flight logs clearly exonerate ine.\n20 sitting here today. So, I knew absolutely that if 20 There's absolutely no doubt about that.\n21 the manifests and the flight logs were accurate, 21 Q. Well, the flight logs, in fact, confirm\n22 they would, of course, exonerate me because I am 22 that you were in the same places at the saine time as\n23 totally, completely, unequivocally innocent of any 23 Virginia Roberts, don't they?\n24 of these charges. 24 A. No, they do not.\n25 So of course I knew that I would be 25 Q. Do you -- do you deny that they confirm\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n17 (Pages 241 to 244)\n245 247\n1 that you were in the same place at the same time — 1 I would be very anxious to see any timeframes when\n2 A. First -- 2 Virginia Roberts claims she was with me on the\n3 Q. — as Virginia Roberts? 3 island, claims she was with me on -- at the ranch,\n4 MR. SCOTT: Let him ask the question. 4 claims she was with me on the airplanes, claims she\n5 THE WITNESS: Okay. 5 was with one in Palin Beach. And they will all\n6 MR. SCOTT: Then you answer the question. 6 conclusively --\n7 And Mr. Scarola will try to, you know, keep the 7 Q. You forgot --\n8 emotion down, I'm sure, so we can get through 8 A. -- prove --\n9 this with less acrimony between everybody here. 9 Q. — New York. Didn't you mean New York\n10 A. Your client has adamantly refused, as well 10 also?\n11 as the lawyer -- 11 A. No, I did not mean New York --\n12 BY MR. SCAROLA: 12 Q. Oh, okay.\n13 Q. No, sir, that's nonresponsive to my 13 A. -- because New York is very different. I\n14 question. 14 was, in fact, in New York for large periods of time.\n15 MR. SCOTT: Wait a minute. 15 I was not, in fact, on the island during the\n16 BY MR. SCAROLA: 16 relevant timeframe. I was not in the airplane in\n17 Q. My question is: Do you deny that the 17 the relevant timeframe. I was not in Jeffrey\n18 flight logs corroborate that you were in the same 18 Epstein's Palm Beach home in the relevant timeframe.\n19 place at the same time as Virginia Roberts? 19 And I was once in the ranch but under circumstances\n20 A. So the question includes the word \"time\" 20 where it would have been absolutely impossible for\n21 and, therefore, I must answer in this way. Your 21 me to have had any contact with her.\n22 client -- 22 So if you will give me the timeframe, I\n23 Q. How to build a watch? 23 will be happy to answer your question. But without\n24 MR. SCOTT: Wait a minute, you're cutting 24 timeframes, that question is an absolutely\n25 him off. He's been trying to answer the 25 inappropriate question. And the answer to it is no.\n246 248\n1 question. 1 Q. Well, Mr. Dershowitz, it might be\n2 A. Your client has adamantly refused, and her 2 inappropriate if you had not repeatedly made the\n3 lawyers and your clients have refused to give me any 3 public statements that the flight logs exonerate\n4 timeframes, any timeframes when your client claims 4 you.\n5 that she had improper -- falsely claims, 5 A. They do.\n6 perjuriously claims that she had improper sexual 6 Q. So what I am attempting to find out is the\n7 encounters with me. 7 basis upon which you can contend that the flight\n8 So how can you possibly ask me a question 8 logs exonerate you if you are now telling us you\n9 that includes the word \"timcframcs\" when your client 9 don't even know when it is that you are alleged to\n10 has refused -- when Virginia Roberts has refused to 10 have been in the same place at the same time as\n11 give any timcframcs? How can it be possible that 11 Virginia Roberts.\n12 the flight logs show me being in the same time and 12 A. Okay.\n13 same place with her when she has refused to describe 13 Q. So how -- how can you make both those\n14 any of the times that she claims to have been in 14 statements?\n15 thosc places? 15 A. Very simple, because I know the timeframe\n16 So the answer to the question is 16 that Virginia Roberts, A, knew Jeffrey Epstein. And\n17 categorically no, sir. 17 during that timeframe, I can conclusively prove that\n18 BY MR. SCAROLA: 18 I was never on Jeffrey Epstein's island where she\n19 Q. What is the question that you are 19 claimed to have sex with me. That the only time I\n20 answering no to? 20 was at the ranch was with my wife, with the Ashe\n21 A. Whether or not the timeframe shows that I 21 family, with my daughter, the house was under\n22 could have been in the same place at the same time 22 construction, we just simply stayed outside the\n23 as your client. Absolutely not. Because we don't 23 house and looked around. That the manifests show I\n24 know what times your client -- now, if you know 24 was never on Jeffrey Epstein's plane during that\n25 that, you should have produced them in discovery and 25 period of time. And the manifests show that I never\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n18 (Pages 245 to 248)\n249 251\n1 flew down to Palm Beach during that relevant period 1 Q. Which of the manifests are you referring\n2 of time. 2 to when you claim what you have claimed about the\n3 So 1 have a timeframe not that was 3 manifests, Exhibit Number 6 or Exhibit Number 7?\n4 provided by your client but that was provided by the 4 A. I can only tell you that I have reviewed\n5 externalities of the case. And that timeframe 5 the manifests and they show, to me, that I was never\n6 coupled with the manifests clearly exonerate me 6 on Jeffrey Epstein's airplane during the relevant\n7 without any doubt. 7 period of time. That's all I can tell you now.\n8 Q. 1 want to make sure that I understood what 8 I'm not in a position where I look at all\n9 you just said. \"I never flew down to Palm Beach 9 these documents now. If you point me to any\n10 during the relevant timeframe\"? 10 particular trip that shows that I was on Jeffrey\n11 A. I never flew down and stayed at Jeffrey's 11 Epstein's plane, I would be happy to respond to\n12 house in Palm Beach during that relevant period of 12 that.\n13 time. 13 Q. There are two separate collections of\n14 Q. Okay. So you want to withdraw the 14 documents purporting to be flight manifests for\n15 statement that you never flew down to Palm Beach — 15 Jeffrey Epstein's plane. When you made the public\n16 MR. SCOTT: Objection. 16 statements that you made regarding the flight logs\n17 BY MR. SCAROLA: 17 or manifests exonerating you, were you referring to\n18 Q. — during that relevant period of time -- 18 Exhibit Number 6 or Exhibit Number 7?\n19 A. Let me be -- 19 A. I have no recollection as to which\n20 MR. SCOTT: Objection. 20 particular exhibits, which are fonned for purposes\n21 BY MR. SCAROLA: 21 of the legal case, I had reviewed. I know I had\n22 Q. — and what you want to say is, \"I never 22 reviewed the manifests. Not only had I reviewed the\n23 flew down to Palm Beach and stayed at Jeffrey 23 manifests, but others reviewed the manifests and\n24 Epstein's house during that timeframe period,\" 24 have conclusively told me that their review of the\n25 correct? 25 manifests shows that I was right.\n250 252\n1 MR. SCOTT: Objection, argumentative -- 1 Q. Who else —\n2 A. Let me be -- 2 MR. SCOTT: Avoid any attorney-client\n3 MR. SCOTT: -- mischaracterization. 3 communications either with Ms. -- you know,\n4 A.

I'm just saying he can't go into\n20 manifests show that I was with Virginia Roberts 20 communications with them.\n21 during the relevant period of time. They do not do 21 MR. SCAROLA: Well, he's already said what\n22 that. And if you would testify under oath to that, 22 the communication was. The communication was\n23 I think you could be subject to pretty -- pretty 23 these manifests prove your position.\n24 scathing cross examination. So your statement is 24 MR.

Okay. I want to be sure now. You're not 12 here and because of the personal issues.

Is that what you were referring to? 21 MR. SCAROLA: Let me try the same question\n22 MR. SCOTT: Let me -- objection to the 22 over again.\n23 form, improper cross examination by taking 23 MR. SCOTT: I think he was defending\n24 excerpts out of depositions of witnesses. 24 his -- his position.\n25 25 THE WITNESS: Right.\n278 280\n1 BY MR. SCAROLA: 1 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n2 Q. Is it your contention that that testimony, 2 Q. The question was: Is that part of the\n3 under oath, of your friend, Mr. Epstein's staff 3 time that you claim exonerates you?\n4 person, exonerates you? 4 A. Well, I think if you read the whole\n5 A. First, a little background. Mr. Alessi 5 testimony, it clearly exonerates me and I think that\n6 was fired for theft of material from Mr. Epstein, so 6 part of the testimony in no way inculpates me and no\n7 Mr. Alessi was not on a friendly basis with Jeffrey 7 reasonable person reading that could use that as a\n8 Epstein. 8 basis for making allegations that I had sexual\n9 Second, the description of the dildos and 9 encounters or misconduct with Virginia Roberts.\n10 sex toys clearly refers to the area of the house 10 So, when -- if that's the best testimony\n11 that I was never in, the area of Ms. Maxwell's room, 11 that your unprofessional clients relied on, then\n12 rather than the area of the room that I stayed in. 12 clearly that exonerates me.\n13 Third, he gives no timeframe for the 13 Again, the absence of evidence is evidence\n14 visits. 14 of absence. And the very idea that this is seen as\n15 And, fourth, he certainly didn't in any 15 some basis for concluding that I had sexual\n16 way confirm that I was there while Virginia Roberts 16 encounters with -- with Virginia Roberts, why wasn't\n17 was there. His answer was simply that l was there 17 he asked did he ever sec ine have a massage by\n18 from time to time. He's wrong about that. During 18 Virginia Roberts? Did he ever see me have a sexual\n19 the relevant timeframe, I was never in the house. 19 encounter with Virginia Roberts? Did he ever go to\n20 And even taking outside the relevant 20 the room I was staying in and find any sex toys?\n21 timeframe, the only time I was in the house for more 21 The answers to all those questions, if\n22 than one day was when my family, my wife, my son, my 22 truthful, would be no.\n23 daughter-in-law, my then probably seven or 23 Q. What was Mr. Alessi's motive against you?\n24 eight-year-old granddaughter, who just graduated 24 You've told us he was fired by Jeffrey Epstein, so\n25 Harvard, and my probably four-year-old grandson, who 25 he may have had some motive against Mr. Epstein.\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n26 (Pages 277 to 280)\n281 283\n1 What was his motive against you? 1 A.

So, he was -- he may have been angry at 12 file charges on behalf of a client alleging that she\n13 you because you assisted in getting him fired? 13 was lent out by Jeffrey Epstein for purposes of\n14 A. It's -- 14 sexual abuse while she was a minor to academicians\n15 MR. SCOTT: Objection, 15 unless he absolutely had confidence that those\n16 mischaracterization. 16 statements were true --\n17 A. Its conjecture. It's possible. But in 17 MR. SCOTT: Let me object --\n18 any event, even -- 18 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n19 BY MR. SCAROLA: 19 Q. — right?\n20 Q. It's conjecture, is that what you were 20 MR.

I'm saying I have -- I don't know what he 22 Whatever Mr. Josefsberg thinks has nothing to\n23 was thinking, but there is a basis for him believing 23 do with this lawsuit. This is all your effort\n24 that. But most -- most important, even if you take 24 to try to put Josefsberg into this case to try\n25 everything he says as true, which its not, its 25 to give some justification to your position.\n282 284\n1 exculpatory because it has no suggestion that I ever 1 A. I'll answer that question.\n2 had any sexual encounter with Virginia Roberts. 2 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n3 And if I were a lawyer reading that -- 3 Q. Thank you.\n4 MR. SCOTT: Its okay? 4 A. And I also know Bob Josefsberg and know\n5 A. -- I certainly would not base this heinous 5 that he would never maintain a friendship, as he has\n6 accusation on that flimsy read. 6 with me, if he believed that I was one of the,\n7 BY MR.

SCAROLA: If its responsive to the 3 I can say with confidence that he would\n4 question. 4 only act ethically and would, A, not represent --\n5 A. Its responsive. And as far as the 5 not make any false statements the way your clients\n6 filibustering is -- 6 made them, and that I wish your clients had the\n7 BY MR. SCAROLA: 7 ethics of Bob Josefsberg.\n8 Q. Do you remember what the question is? 8 Q. You then agree that if Bob Josefsberg\n9 A. -- is concerned, I was here -- 9 advanced the claims that I have described in a\n10 Q. Do you remember what the question was? 10 complaint on behalf of a client, he would not have\n11 A. Yes. Yes. 11 done so unless he believed those allegations to be\n12 Q. What is the question? 12 true, having conducted a fair and reasonable\n13 A. The question is -- no, why don't you 13 investigation, correct?\n14 repeat the question. 14 MR. SCOTT: Objection, asked and answered\n15 Q. Yes, sir. 15 several times.\n16 A. So -- 16 A. I don't know the answer to that question\n17 Q. You know that Bob Josefsberg would not 17 because I don't know the context in which he made\n18 advance allegations on behalf of a client that that 18 these arguments. All do know is that he never\n19 client had been lent out by Jeffrey Epstein to 19 would maintain a friendship with me if he believed\n20 satisfy the sexual desires of friends of Jeffrey 20 in any way that I was one of the people that she had\n21 Epstein, including academicians, unless Bob 21 accused.\n22 Josefsberg believed those allegations to be true, 22 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n23 right? 23 Q. Did Alfredo Rodriguez, another one of your\n24 A. I believe that -- I know that Bob 24 friend's staff persons, have a motive to lie against\n25 Josefsberg would never maintain a friendship with 25 you?\n286 288\n1 me, as he has, if he believed that I was one of 1 A. Alberto Rodriguez --\n2 those academicians. Bob Josefsberg knows that I was 2 Q. No, sir, Alfredo Rodriguez.\n3 not one of those academicians, and the inference of 3 A. Alfredo Rodriguez, I never knew him by\n4 your question is beneath contempt, sir. 4 name. He was, of course, there out -- well outside\n5 Q. Could we try to answer the question now? 5 of the timeframe of the alleged events in this case.\n6 A. The answer is that Bob Josefsberg would 6 And so anything that he would be able to testify to\n7 never maintain a friendship with me if he believed 7 would bear no relationship whatsoever to the -- the\n8 that there was any possibility that I was among the 8 allegations here.\n9 academicians who she was accusing of sexual 9 He was criminally prosecuted, to my\n10 misconduct. I do not believe that she ever accused 10 memory, for having stolen material and turned it\n11 me of sexual misconduct to Bob Josefsberg, to the 11 over to Bradley Edwards is my recollection. And as\n12 FBI, to the U.S. attorney, or even, sir, to you and 12 the result of that clearly had a motive to lie. And\n13 Bradley Edwards, as she says in 2000, I think, '11. 13 the same with Mr. Alessi, clearly would have a basis\n14 I think she made up this story on the eve of the 14 for believing that I may have played a role as\n15 filing in 2014. 15 Jeffrey Epstein's lawyer in seeking to do harm to\n16 Q. You do agree that Bob Josefsberg would not 16 him.\n17 have advanced the claims that he advanced if he did 17 But again, there's nothing in\n18 not have confidence that they were true, correct? 18 Mr. Rodriguez's testimony which is in any way\n19 A. 1 have no idea what he believed or knew at 19 inculpatory of me. I think he has me sitting and --\n20 the time. I would say this: I know Bob Josefsberg 20 and reading a book and drinking a glass of wine.\n21 is an extraordinarily ethical lawyer. Idol* know 21 Q. In the presence of young women?\n22 what his responsibilities were in the case. I don't 22 A. No.\n23 know whether his responsibilities were to make those 23 Q.

So you're telling me that you don't know\n3 where she was and that's --\n4 A. We just -- we just gave you everything we\n5 had --\n6 MR. SCOTT: We provided hundreds and\n7 hundreds of pages. You're picking out one.\n8 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n9 Q. Let's go -- let's go to the next page, if\n10 we could, please, the third page in this composite.\n11 A. The third, okay. Third, okay.\n12 Q.

And can we also agree that during this\n314\n19 period of time, you were making regular appearances\n20 in New York on Court TV?\n21 MR. SCOTT: Review the document before you\n22 answer the question, please.\n23 A. It says 12/30, Court TV, yes. There was a\n24 period of time where I had a contract with Court TV\n25 and I would appear when they asked me to, yeah.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n316\nA. I don't -- I don't know.\nQ. Well, what other Jeff might it be?\nA. 1 know -- I know many, many Jeffs.\nQ. Tell me which other Jeffs it might have\nbeen a reference to --\nA. I have no idea.\nQ. -- on this calendar page.\nA. I just have no idea. I would be\nspeculating.\nQ. During the same period of time on\nDecember 12 when there's a calendar entry that\nreflects 1:30, Jeff, we know from the flight logs\nthat Jeffrey Epstein traveled on December 11 from\nPalm Beach International Airport to Teterboro\nAirport, which is the private plane facility that\nservices the New York Metropolitan area.\nA. I have no idea.\nYou don't know?\nA. No, I have no idea whether he was on that\nplane. 1 haven't seen the flight log.\nQ. Well, I'm calling your attention to the\nflight log. It's the next page.\nA. It's the next page here?\nQ. Yes, sir.\nA. Okay.\n35 (Pages 313 to 316)\nwww.phippsreporting.com\n(888)811-3408\n1 Q. December 11, 2000, PBI to Teterboro,\n2 passengers, Jeffrey Epstein --\n3 A. Wait a second. I have to find it.\n4 MR. SCOTT: Well, let him -- let him read\n5 the exhibit.\n6 A. What -- what's the date?\n7 BY MR. SCAROLA:\n8 Q. December 11.\n9 A. December 11. Yes, 1 see that.\n10 Q. Palm Beach International Airport to\n317\n11. Teterboro?\n12 A. Right, yeah.\n13 Q. Passengers, Jeffrey Epstein?\n14 A. Right.\n15 Q. GM, a reference to Ghislaine -- excuse me,\n16 Ghislaine Maxwell.\n17 A. Uh-huh.\n18 Q. And ET and Virginia, right?\n19 A. That's what it says, yes, sir.\n20 Q. And then we see three of the same four\n21 passengers leaving the New York area.\n22 A. Uh-huh.\n23 Q. To fly to another destination three days\n24 later on December 14, correct?\n25 A. Yes.\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n319\nthat, but that you were in New York at the same time\nJeffrey Epstein --\nA. And that Carolyn --\nQ. — and Virginia were in Ncw York and you\nwere --\nA. And that Carolyn arranged for a massage.\nQ. -- having a massage.\nA. And that my wife arranged for a massage.\nQ. No, 1 didn't say that at all, sir?\nMR. SCOTT: Well, that's what he's saying\nthat the record reflects.\nA. The record --\nMR. SCOTT: Don't cut him off.\nA. -- reflects that Carolyn -- Carolyn always\nwanted me to have massages because she thought it\nwould relax me. ldon't like massages particularly,\nbut when Carolyn arranged massages, almost always we\nhad them together at the same time. We would have\nthe same masseuse, sometimes a man, sometimes a\nwoman, come to the house and give us massages\ntogether.\nThe idea that my wife would arrange for me\nto have a massage with an underage girl for sexual\npurposes is so bizarre and absurd as to defy any\nkind of credibility, but go on.\n318\n1 Q. And let's look at the next page of your\n2 wife's diary for December 13, the period of time\n3 when the flight log shows Jeffrey Epstein and\n4 Virginia in New York --\n5 A. Uh-huh.\n6 Q. -- at the same time when it would appear\n7 that you were in New York. And at the bottom of\n8 this calendar, Wednesday, December 13, A.D.,\n9 massage, right?\n10 A. 10:00 a.m. it says? What is it?\n11 Q. It says 10, 10-A.D. massage?\n12 A. Yeah.\n13 Q. Okay.\n14 Let's go to the next composite.\n15 A. I don't have -- there's another page after\n16 that. Oh, the next composite.\n17 Q. Yes, sir.\n18 A. Yeah.\n19 Q. Composite Number 10.\n20 A. Uh-huh. But -- but I just want to be\n21 clear. So you're saying Carolyn was with me in\n22 Ncw York during that period of time.\n23 Q. No, I'm not saying that at all, sir. I\n24 suggest that when we take a close look at the\n25 calendar, it's going to reveal something other than\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\nBY MR.

I'm not going to instruct him not to\n01:11:15 9 I just want you to know that you have asked a broad 01:13:10 9 answer, but it is an improper question.\n01:11:18 10 question that's going to require a broad and extended 01:1314 10 MR. SIMPSON: I disagree, but you can answer\n01:11:20 11 answer. It -- it -- 01:13:14 11 the question.\n01:11:21 12 Q. Answer the question. 01:13:14 12 THE WITNESS: Right. So the -- the factual\n011122 13 A. Okay. Then I'm going to refer to a -- I have 01:13.17 13 basis would -- we are setting aside\n01:11:27 14 a -- well, actually, I don't. 01:13:21 14 attorney/client communications, right?\n01:11:28 15 Q. Let me ask you this: Before you refer to 01:13:21 15 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:11:30 16 something -- 01:13:22 16 Q. I'm asking: What would you tell the judge?\n01:11:30 17 A. Yeah. 01:13:2617 A. Right. So that -- I -- I -- that's\n01:11:30 18 Q. -- please give me your best recollection of 01.112818 speculative to -- I don't think I can give a fair answer\n01:1134 19 what the basis was, the factual basis that you had in 01:13:30 19 at this point because that would have involved going\n01:11:37 20 mind. If the court said to you -- let me put it this 01:113220 back to my client and -- and carving out what kinds\n01:11:40 21 way. If you went to court and Judge Marra said, 01:1136 21 of things we were going to present to Judge Marra in\n01.11:43 22 Professor Cassell, what's your factual basis for this 01:13:30 22 light of the posture of the case at that point.\n01:11:46 23 allegation? Tell me. What would you say? 0113,42 23 So it's a speculative question. I would\n01:11:48 24 A. Right. 01:1145 24 have -- let me just -- without going into any\n01:11:49 25 MS. McCAWLEY: Wait.

SCAROLA: Excuse me. You have asked two 01:13:55 2 MR. SIMPSON: I move to strike as\n01:11:55 3 different questions now, and I need to understand 01:1156 3 nonresponsive.\n01:11:56 4 which question you are asking. 01:13,56 4 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:1158 5 The question that you posed before just now 01:13:58 5 Q. Let me ask it this way: We have talked\n01:12:02 6 was: What was the reason for your including 01:14'00 6 about -- somewhat about the basis for this allegation\n01:12:06 7 those allegations in this pleading? 01:14.02 7 about other minors. Putting aside information as to\n01.12:08 8 Now you have asked: What is the factual 01:14:09 8 which you're claiming privilege, tell me what you knew\n01:12:10 9 basis? And that's going back to questions that 01:14:13 9 as of December 30th, 2014, that formed the factual basis\n01:12:14 10 we have already covered, and we have, I think, 01:14:20 10 for your -- for that allegation about other minors.\n01'12:17 11 exhausted the ability to respond to that question 01:14:23 11 MR. SCAROLA: And I'll instruct you not to\n01:12:20 12 outside of privileged information. 01:14:25 12 answer that question for the same reason, that\n01:1213 13 Do you want to go back to the question about: 01:14:27 13 when the same question was asked earlier, I\n01:12:26 14 What was your reason for including those 01:14:29 14 instructed you not to answer.\n01:12:28 15 allegations? 01:1411 15 MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I'm -- maybe we are not\n01:12:29 16 MR. SIMPSON: I'll ask the question a 01:14:33 16 being clear, Jack. I'm asking him to put\n01:1210 17 different way. 01:14:35 17 aside -- I mean, certainly, he -- he filed a\n01:12:31 18 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 01:14:37 18 pleading. You've asserted privilege as to\n01:12:31 19 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:14:40 19 certain aspects. I'm simply asking him, putting\n011213 20 Q. Mr. Cassell, I'm going to ask you: If you're 01:14:43 20 aside whatever you're claiming privilege for,\n0t12:37 21 in court and Judge Marra said to you, counsel, what is 01:14:45 21 right, so I'm not -- I'm not asking you right now\n0112:42 22 the factual basis for your allegation that Professor 01:14:47 22 to tell me anything you're claiming as\n01:1247 23 Dershowitz abused other minors, what would you say? And 01:14,49 23 privileged.\n0112:51 24 if you wouldn't say something because it was privileged, 01:14:49 24 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:12'52 25 then don't include it. What would you tell the judge 01:14:50 25 Q. Tell me whatever is not privileged that\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM Page 61 to 64 of 151 16 of 38 sheets\n65 67\n0114:53 1 supports that allegation. 01:16:52 1 began, you know, I guess what we would call\n01:14:55 2 A. Okay. The privileged information, obviously, 01:16:54 2 knock-and-talks, knocking on doors to try to get to some\n01:14:58 3 you're asking me not to reveal at this point. 01:16:57 3 of these girls, and they would get to the girls, and\n01:14:59 4 Q. I'm asking you -- I'm asking you to tell me 0116:59 4 many of them initially were -- were afraid to explain\n01:75930 5 the nonprivileged information. And I'm not agreeing 0117:02 5 what had happened.\n01:15:04 6 with your privilege assertion -- 0117:03 6 But as they -- as they continued talking to\n01:15:04 7 A. Sure. 01:17:06 7 them, the girls began to explain that what was happening\n01:15:07 8 Q. -- but for purposes of this question -- 0117:09 8 was, they were going over to Epstein's house under the\n01:15:07 9 A. For purposes of this question. 01:17:13 9 guise of giving a massage, and when they got there, the\n01:1507 10 Q. -- I'm accepting it. 01'1717 10 massage was, in fact, sexual activity.\n01:15:07 11 A. All right. 0117:19 11 And for many of the girls, I think, as I say\n0115:08 12 Q. Putting aside what you claim is privileged, I 01:17:22 12 around 23, 24, something along those lines, they were\n0115:10 13 want to know everything that's the factual basis for 01:1725 13 underage. They were under the age of consent in\n01:15:12 14 including the allegation about other minors. 0117:28 14 Florida.\n01:15:14 15 A. Okay. Privileged information which I'm not 01.17:28 15 And so each and every one of those events was\n0115'17 16 disclosing in any way would have interacted with a vast 01:17:30 16 a crime being perpetrated -- and let's be clear, not\n011620 17 body of other information. 01:17:35 17 just being perpetrated by Epstein, but by other people\n01:15:22 18 The vast body of other information would have 01:17.36 18 who were involved there at the mansion.\n01:15:24 19 started with an 89-page police report from the Palm 01:17:38 19 And so what the -- the Palm Beach Police\n0115:29 20 Beach Police Department that showed for about a 0117.40 20 Department was putting together was that this mansion in\n01:15:30 21 six-month period in 2005, there was sexual abuse of 01:17:43 21 Florida was the nest of sexual abuse of young girls here\n01:15:35 22 minor girls going on on a daily basis, in -- whenever 01:17-48 22 in Florida that involved, literally, in the -- in this\n01:15:40 23 Jeffrey Epstein was in his Palm Beach mansion. 01:17:53 23 period of time, more than a hundred events that they\n01:15:44 24 And on some cases, it was going on not once, 01:17:57 24 were able to document of sexual abuse.\n01:15:48 25 not twice, but three times during the day. That -- let 0117:59 25 And when you put that together with the\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n66 68\n01:15:51 1 me just be clear. I mean, I -- I referred to the 01:18:01 1 pattern or practice that was being revealed there, there\n01:15:53 2 89-page police report. I have offered to put it into 011803 2 were hundreds of acts of sexual abuse going on in the\n01:15:55 3 the record if -- if it would speed things up, but let's 01:1806 3 mansion.\n01-15:58 4 just talk about some of the things that are in that 01:18:07 4 But then what becomes -- and this is where I\n01:15:59 5 89-page police report. 0118:10 5 indicated that, you know, the answer would continue on.\n0116:02 6 This was a -- a very intensive investigation 01:1812 6 The -- the problem was that the evidence was starting to\n51:18:05 7 that the Palm Beach Police Department put together. 01:1814 7 show that this was a much broader series of events. For\n011607 8 They did, for example, what are called trash covers; 011818 8 example, there were flight logs showing that Mr. Epstein\n01:16:09 9 that is when trash came out of the -- of the mansion of 01:18:21 9 was then flying with underaged girls, and those flight\n01:16:13 10 Epstein, the police would intercept the trash and then 0118:27 10 logs, you know, as -- as the flight logs began to\n01:16.16 11 they would go through the trash and look for 01-18'29 11 develop, for example, we have seen, I know in the last\n01:16:17 12 incriminating information. 0118:32 12 day or two here, one underage girl was Virginia Roberts\n0116'19 13 And what they began to discover was memo 0118:35 13 who is on the flight, you know, with Epstein, and with\n01,1022 14 pads -- and I say \"memo pads,\" let's be clear, pad after 01:18:39 14 Maxwell, and those sorts of things.\n01:1026 15 pad after pad, or I guess I should say, sheet after 01:18:41 15 So you start to look at the flight logs and\n01:16:28 16 sheet after sheet that had the name of a girl, and then 01:1643 16 you see what's going on is not just events that are\n0016:33 17 there was a notation of something to the effect of a 01:18,46 17 occurring in Florida, but it's occurring on a\n01:16:35 18 massage. 01:18:50 18 multi-state basis, which now starts to make it a federal\n01:16:36 19 And so the Palm Beach Police Department began 01:18:53 19 crime. For example, we are seeing evidence that --\n01:16:39 20 tracking down, well, wait a minute, these -- these are 01:18:56 20 let's just talk about Virginia Roberts since she's\n01:16'41 21 girls giving massages and they don't seem to have any 01:1858 21 central to this case.\n01:16:44 22 specialized training in massages; they don't seem to be 01,18:59 22 We are seeing Virginia Roberts being flown\n01,16.47 23 masseuses in any sense of the term; what's going on 01:19:02 23 from Florida to New York where she's in the clutches of\n01:1047 24 here? 01:19.07 24 Jeffrey Epstein who is sexually abusing her, you know,\n01:16:50 25 And so the Palm Beach Police Department 011912 25 many times a week. And not just Jeffrey Epstein, but\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n17 of 38 sheets Page 65 to 68 of 151 10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n69 71\n01:19:15 1 other powerful persons. For example, Ghislaine Maxwell 01:21:37 1 particular girl had been sexually abused.\n01:19:18 2 is there with him on all of these flights and apparently 01:21:40 2 What the Palm Beach Police Department had\n01,19:21 3 being involved in the abuse. 01:21:42 3 discovered was brazen, notorious, repetitive activity\n01:1924 4 Indeed -- and so you -- you have -- you 01:2146 4 sometimes occurring as often as three times in a\n01:1927 5 have that. You also start to see on the flight logs, 01,21:48 5 particular day. And so that led me to believe that the\n01:19:30 6 what to my mind are some very sinister things, 01:21:51 6 sexual activity that was going on in Florida was such\n01:19:34 7 suggesting that the pattern is not just confined to sort 01:21:54 7 that someone who was a regular house guest there would\n01:19:36 8 of, you know, the girls that are there in Florida, but 01:21:57 8 have immediately come to the conclusion that, well,\n01:19:39 9 it -- it is extending more broadly. 0122:00 9 look, gee, there are these underage girls coming in here\n01,19A1 10 Like one of the -- to my mind, sinister and 01:22:0310 and they -- they seem to be -- you know, they don't seem\n01:1544 11 scary things on the flight logs is, we see, you know, 01:2206 11 to be here to be doing, you know, business activities;\n01:19:48 12 Virginia Roberts, who we know has been sexually abused, 0122:0812 they -- they might be here doing other kinds of\n01:19:51 13 and we see Jeffrey Epstein, and then we see on the 01:22:11 13 activities. So those would be the kinds of things that\n01:19:54 14 flight logs one female. 0122:13 14 would -- would have formed the factual basis.\n01:19:55 15 That's kind of an odd notation for a flight 01:22:17 15 There are other things as well, but I'm sure\n01:19:59 16 log because, you know, typically, I understand the 0122:18 16 you want to ask other questions in addition to that. So\n01:20:02 17 flight logs, the purpose is, well, if something happens 01:22:22 17 I'll stop there, but those -- that's -- I think gives\n0120:04 18 with the flight, or there's some question about who was 01:22:24 18 you a small flavor of the kind of evidence that, you\n01:20:05 19 on it, you want to know who -- who the person was who 01:22:28 19 know, was form -- undergirding the allegations that were\n01:20:07 20 was on the flight. 01:22:32 20 being presented here.\n01:20:08 21 So, to my mind, when I started to see on 01:2232 21 Q. It sounds like you quite passionately believe\n01,20:10 22 these flight logs entries like one female, I viewed that 012235 22 that there was strong evidence that Mr. Epstein had\n01:20:15 23 as a potential device for obscuring the fact that there 01:22:39 23 engaged in sexual misconduct; is that right?\n01:20:17 24 was interstate trafficking of underage girls for 01:22:41 24 A. I think \"strong\" understates it.\n01:20:19 25 purposes of sexual activity. Serious federal offenses. 01:2244 25 Q. In the course of that long answer, you didn't\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n70 72\n01:20:22 1 But then that evidence extended, you know, 01:22:48 1 mention Professor Dershowitz's name once.\n01:2026 2 more broadly than that. The evidence also started to 01:22:51 2 A. I said flight logs. And let's talk about\n01:20:28 3 show, again, if we talk just about flight logs, that 01:22:53 3 flight logs.\n01,20,31 4 the -- that underage girls such as Virginia Roberts were 01:22:54 4 Q. Let me back up. You didn't answer his\n01:20:34 5 being flown internationally from, for example, Teterboro 01:22:57 5 name -- mention his name once; is that -- is that your\n01:20:39 6 in New York to -- to locations, just to pick one, you 01:23:00 6 recollection as well?\n01:20:42 7 know, for example, in London, where again sexual abuse 01:23:00 7 A. That's correct. We were talking about a\n0120:45 8 was occurring. 01:23:02 8 factual basis, and I'll be glad -- I told you that there\n0120:47 9 And so you started to put together this 01:23:05 9 were other things if you want, factual basis for -- for\n01:20:50 10 pattern of criminality that was started in this -- you 01:23:07 10 Mr. Dershowitz. I'll be glad to add that in. Let me -.-\n01:20,54 11 know, I don't know what the right word is here. I don't 01:23:10 11 let's -- let me -- let me -- I would like to supplement\n012056 12 want to -- I don't want to -- you know, you've heard 01:2311 12 my answer then if I could.\n01:20:58 13 discussions of hyperbole and things like that, but we 01:23:12 13 Q. Do you want to look at a document?\n01:21:01 14 have got this nest of -- of -- and I won't say snakes, 01:23:14 14 A. Yes.\n0121:04 15 but we have this nest of criminals in Florida, but it -- 01:23:14 15 Q. Let me first -- have we exhausted your\n01:21,07 16 it seems to be spreading to Epstein's mansion in New 0123:16 16 recollection without documents of all the evidence that\n01:21:10 17 York; it seems to be spreading to Ghislaine Maxwell's 01:23:21 17 you would refer to to support the allegation that\n01:21:14 18 flat in London, and -- and -- and it goes on. 01:23:23 18 Professor Dershowitz abused other minors?\n01:21:17 19 So those are the kinds of things that would 0123:26 19 A.

So I mentioned the Palm Beach Police Department 0127:01 1 correctly, working from memory as -- as you were\n01:24:14 2 report. 01:27:04 2 wondering about, there was a notation that\n01:24:15 3 The next thing that I want to mention is the 01:27:06 3 Mr. Dershowitz was on a plane with one female.\n012419 4 Jane Doe 102 complaint. In August of 2009, Bob 0127:08 4 And so I was -- when I looked at that, I'm\n01:24:27 5 Josefsberg -- who is, from what I understood, a very 0127:11 5 seeing Mr. Dershowitz on a -- on a flight with a woman\n01:24:32 6 well-regarded lawyer here in Florida; in fact, a lawyer 01:2715 6 who doesn't seem to be there for, frankly anything other\n01:24:33 7 that was selected by the United States Government to 01:27:18 7 than sexual purposes or something along those lines with\n01:24:36 8 represent a number of the -- of the girls that had been 01:27:21 8 Mr. Epstein, with Mr. Epstein, who is a sex trafficker,\n01:24,40 9 sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. He was -- he was 01:27:25 9 and with one female which seemed to me to be a potential\n01'24.43 10 part of the procedure that was including the\n0127:30 10 entry for disguising international sex trafficking. So\n01:24:45 11 nonprosecution agreement. 01:27:33 11 that was of concern.\n01:24:46 12 In August of 2009, he filed a complaint on 01:27:34 12 I then began to look at, well, I wonder, how\n01:24:48 13 behalf of Virginia Roberts. That complaint indicated 0127:36 13 would I find out if Mr. Dershowitz had been abusing\n01:24:54 14 that Virginia Roberts had been sexually abused in 01:2739 14 other girls? Let's see. I knew that Virginia Roberts\n01,24:58 15 Florida, in New York, and in -- in other places, as I 01:274215 had been forced to -- to -- to -- to do this sort of\n01:25:02 16 recall. The thing that -- that I particularly recall 01:27:48 16 thing.\n01,25:06 17 was that Mr. Josefsberg had said, Virginia Roberts was 01:27:56 17 MS. McCAWLEY: You're okay as long as\n01:2$.12 18 abused by -- and he gave some categories of people. 01:2756 18 you're -- if you're revealing something that's in\n01:2515 19 He mentioned, I think, business people. He 01:2759 19 an affidavit --\n01:25:17 20 mentioned royalty, and he mentioned academicians. And 012759 20 THE WITNESS: That's right.\n01:25:23 21 so to tie into your question, I knew that Professor 0127:59 21 MS. McCAWLEY: -- that she submitted, you're\n01:2525 22 Dershowitz was an academician. And so what I was seeing 0127.59 22 fine.\n0125:29 23 now was, that according to a very, very respected 01:28:00 23 THE WITNESS: Right. So -- so what...\n01:2632 24 attorney here in Florida, he had found Virginia Roberts 0128'05 24 Let's see. What did I want, at this point --\n01:25:34 25 to be credible, and had filed a lawsuit against 01:2605 25\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n19 of 38 sheets Page 73 to 76 of 151 10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n77 79\n0128:05 1 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:29:47 1 MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah.\n01:28:09 2 Q. Do you want the question back? 01:29:49 2 MR. SCAROLA: -- who keeps jumping up and\n01:28:10 3 A. No. I'm just trying to remember what I was 01:29:50 3 down and distracting everybody in the room?\n01:28:12 4 thinking about with -- with regard to -- 0129:52 4 MS. McCAWLEY: And there was also profanity\n0128:15 5 MR. SCAROLA: Do you need the response read 01'2054 5 used earlier. I mean, we just have to settle\n01:28:17 6 back up to the point -- 01:29:55 6 down on this side, and take a deep breath, and\n0128:18 7 THE WITNESS: Yeah, if you would do that, 0129:58 7 let him answer his questions.\n01:2820 8 yeah. I just -- 0129:58 8 MR. SIMPSON: Look, I mean, the same thing\n01:28:20 9 MR. SCAROLA: -- about privilege arose. 01:29:59 9 was happening on the other side.\n01:28:20 10 THE WITNESS: Yeah. Let's just see what that 01:30:00 10 MR. SCAROLA: No, sir.\n01:2820 11 one -- 01:3600 11 MS. McCAWLEY: There was no profanity on this\n01:2821 12 MR. SCAROLA: Just read the last couple of 01;30:00 12 side of the table.\n01:28:22 13 sentences back, or the last two sentences. 01:3060 13 MR. SCAROLA: No, no, no. There was never\n01:28:31 14 THE WITNESS: Oh, I'm sorry. Now I remember 01:3003 14 anyone who jumped to their feet at any time\n0128:32 15 exactly what I was thinking. 01:3066 15 during the course of the last two days. The only\n01:28:32 16 How would we go find out whether Mr. Epstein 01:30:08 16 person who keeps jumping up is Alan Dershowitz.\n01:28:35 17 was lending women, or in this case, underage 01:30:13 17 Have him pass you a note quietly, if you would,\n01:28:39 18 girls, to Mr. Dershowitz for sexual purposes? 01'3016 18 please.\n01:2841 19 Well, the first thing I want to do was ask -- you 01:30:18 19 MR. SIMPSON: I will disagree with your\n01:2845 20 know, I'd -- I'd go ask Jeffrey Epstein. 01:30:19 20 characterization, but let me say the\n01728:47 21 And so what I discovered when I started to 01:3020 21 argumentation -\n01:2848 22 look at the transcripts, there were a number of 01:30:21 22 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. Are you -- are you\n01:28:52 23 transcripts where Mr. Epstein was asked about 01:30:22 23 making the representation --\n01:28:55 24 Alan Dershowitz. And rather than say, well, no, 01:30:22 24 MR. SIMPSON: No, I'm not.\n01:28,57 25 he wasn't involved in any of these illegal 01:3023 25 MR. SCAROLA: -- that somebody on this side\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n78 80\n012000 1 activities, Jeffrey Epstein took the Fifth as the 01:30:24 1 of the room jumped up?\n01:29:03 2 phrase, you know, to be more precise. He 01:3025 2 MR. SIMPSON: No, no, no, I'm not.\n01:29:05 3 exercised his right against compelled 01:3026 3 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Thank you.\n01:2966 4 self-incrimination and refused to answer the 01:3026 4 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not.\n01:2909 5 question, which since these were civil cases, 01:30:27 5 MR. SCAROLA: And I appreciate that.\n01:29:11 6 indicated to me, since he was being represented 01:30:27 6 MR. SIMPSON: And I --\n01:29:14 7 by very experienced legal counsel, that there was 01:3029 7 MR. SCAROLA: And you do acknowledge that\n01:2016 8 more than an insignificant risk of incriminating 01:30:30 8 Mr. Dershowitz has repeatedly been jumping up in\n01:2919 9 himself if he answered that. 01:30:33 9 the middle of testimony, correct?\n01:2920 10 And so Jeffrey Epstein now had taken the 01:30:36 10 MR. SIMPSON: That's -- he just got up and\n01:29:23 11 Fifth. And one of the things that I was aware of 01:30:37 11 came over to me. That's the only time I'm aware\n0129:26 12 having been involved in, you know, civil 01:30:39 12 of, because I'm -- I'm looking at the witness,\n01:29:28 13 litigation and criminal litigation in other 01:3041 13 but he did just do that, and I will pass notes.\n01:29:30 14 cases, was that once somebody refuses to answer a 01:30:44 14 We won't get up.\n01:2032 15 question like, you know: Do you know 01:30,45 15 MR. SCAROLA: Okay. Well, I will tell you --\n01:29:35 16 Mr. Dershowitz? And they take the Fifth on that, 01:30:45 16 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to take time from\n01:29:38 17 that you're then entitled to draw what's called 01:3047 17 this.\n0129:40 18 an adverse inference. You can -- you can infer 01:30:47 18 MR. SCAROLA: I will -- I will, for the\n012042 19 that, well, if they answered that question, they 01:3049 19 record, as an officer of the court, represent\n01:29:44 20 would have -- 01:30:51 20 that there have been multiple times during the\n01:29,44 21 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. 01:30:54 21 course of Professor Cassell's deposition when\n0129:44 22 MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah, I want to make an 01,30:58 22 Alan Dershowitz has jumped up in the middle of\n01:29:44 23 objection here -- 01:3161 23 the testimony and excitedly whispered in your\n01:29,44 24 MR.

Could you please 01:31:07 24 ear.\n012047 25 try to control your client -- 01:31:07 25 You may not have realized it because you were\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM Page 77 to 80 of 151 20 of 38 sheets\n81 83\n01:31:08 1 focusing on the witness, but everybody on this 01:33:11 1 review, in which he took the Fifth when asked questions\n01:31:10 2 side of the room has been distracted by his 01:33:13 2 about Dershowitz.\n01:31:13 3 unprofessional conduct. 01:3114 3 So, at that point, in trying to figure out,\n0111:16 4 MR. SIMPSON: I'm not going to argue with 01:33,17 4 you know, whether Mr. Dershowitz was involved in\n01:31:18 5 you. And I -- 01:3120 5 sexually abusing, not only Virginia Roberts, but in\n01:3318 6 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 01:33:24 6 other girls, then you go down to the next level, next\n01:31:18 7 MR. SIMPSON: -- I disagree with that 01:3126 7 layer of the criminal conspiracy.\n01:31:20 8 characterization. There is another attorney 01:33:28 8 Epstein is at the top, so you go to the next\n01:31:22 9 sitting between us. We will pass notes. 01:3131 9 layer. These are, you know, basically the -- the women\n0111,24 10 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you. 011313 10 who, from what I could gather, were -- were older than\n01:31:25 11 MR. SIMPSON: And we -- and I believe, 01:33:36 11 the age that Epstein wanted to sexually abuse. I think\n01,31:29 12 Ms. McCawley, were you instructing not to answer 01,3140 12 these were 22 and 23-year-old girls, so they had, you\n01:31:30 13 or what was happening? What did you -- what were 01,33:44 13 know, essentially aged out of being his sexual abuse\n01:3134 14 you raising? 01:33:47 14 victims, but they continued to -- what they would do is\n01:31:34 15 MS. McCAWLEY: No. There was a lot of 01:33:50 15 collect girls for him under the age of 18, that I guess\n01:31:35 16 yelling going on here, so I was trying to make 01:33:5316 was in his target range.\n01:31:37 17 sure that everybody was quiet -- 01:3355 17 And so what -- so the next person I wanted to\n18 MR.

Sarah Kellen is on a lot of these flight logs\n20 answer. 01:3404 20 with, you know, these girls that -- or women and with\n21 MR. SIMPSON: All right. Let me back up. 01:34:07 21 Epstein and others, and so I wanted to talk to Sarah\n22 BY MR. SIMPSON: 0114:07 22 Kellen.\n01:3141 23 Q. Professor Cassell, I think you were in the 011411 23 But what I discovered there was that, when\n01:31:41 24 middle of an answer? 01:3415 24 Sarah Kellen was asked about Alan Dershowitz, she took\n01:31:42 25 A. i was. Yes, if I could conclude -- 01:3418 25 the Fifth, and there was -- she wasn't the only one.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n82 84\n01:31:43 1 MR. SIMPSON: All right. Could the court 01:34:21 1 There was Miss Mucinska, who also took the Fifth when\n01:31:44 2 reporter read me the last two lines of your 01:34:25 2 asked questions about Alan Dershowitz.\n01:31:46 3 answer? 01:34:27 3 And then there was Marcin -- Miss Marcinkova\n01:3146 4 THE WITNESS: Okay. 01:34:30 4 who also took the Fifth. So what we -- what I had at\n01,31:46 5 (Thereupon, a portion of the record was read 011433 5 this point was Jeffrey Epstein's international sex\n01:31:46 6 by the reporter.) 01:34:35 6 trafficking organization. I had the next echelon, and\n01:31:46 7 BY MR. SIMPSON: 0134:38 7 both the top kingpin of the sex trafficking\n01:32:26 8 Q. Okay. Can you pick up then? 01,34:42 8 organization, and the next echelon had taken the Fifth,\n01.32:27 9 A. Sure. I'll pick up -- pick up the -- 01:34:46 9 had refused to answer questions about Alan Dershowitz.\n01:32:27 10 Q. Okay. 011449 10 And so, at -- at that point, I was drawing an\n01:32:31 11 A. So I was beginning to draw an adverse 01:3451 11 adverse inference, not just from one person, but from\n01:32,31 12 inference when 3effrey Epstein, who is at the heart of 01:34:54 12 four persons, and that adverse inference was being\n01:32:34 13 the sexual abuse of, not only Virginia Roberts, but 01:34157 13 strengthened by the surrounding circumstances, some of\n01:32:39 14 dozens and dozens and dozens of -- of girls literally 01:35.00 14 which we have already talked about.\n01:32,40 15 scattered across the globe, takes the Fifth, refuses to 01:35:00 15 One of the things that -- that really\n01:32:43 16 answer the question, off the top of my head, I can't 01:35:02 16 bolstered the adverse inference that I was drawing in\n01:32:46 17 recall exactly, but something along lines of: Do you 0135.55 17 this case was that I've mentioned those three girls,\n011148 18 know Alan Dershowitz? And he says, I take the Fifth. 01:35:09 18 Kellen, Mucinska, and Marcinkova. They were all covered\n01:3260 19 That sort of, frankly, startled me, that -- that this 0115:12 19 by a nonprosecution agreement. And the nonprosecution\n01,32:55 20 international sex trafficker was taking the Fifth now 01:35:15 20 agreement was highly unusual.\n01:32:57 21 when asked about Mr. Dershowitz. 01:35:17 21 1 -- I had been a federal prosecutor for\n01:3101 22 And so I was stymied in trying to get 01:35:18 22 about four years, I had been a federal judge for about\n01,33:04 23 information from Mr. Epstein at that point. I think 01,35:21 23 five-and-a-half years, so I had seen a lot of -- of, you\n011107 24 there were two depositions, if I recall correctly off 0115:23 24 know, nonprosecution types of arrangements. And one of\n01:33:09 25 the top of my head, that -- that I had an opportunity to 011626 25 the things that was very unusual in this one is, it has\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n21 of 38 sheets Page 81 to 84 of 151 10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n85 87\n01:35:29 1 what I'll refer to as the blank-check immunity 01:37:40 1 that are said there, but Alessi puts Mr. Dershowitz at\n01:35:33 2 provision. 01,37:46 2 the nest of this international sex trafficking\n01:35:34 3 There was a provision in the nonprosecution 01:37:47 3 organization. Let's see. I think he said four or five\n01:3636 4 agreement that said, this agreement will prevent federal 01:37:51 4 times a year, two or three -- you know, two or three\n01:35:40 5 prosecution for international and interstate sex 01:37:55 5 days when he goes there.\n01:35:43 6 trafficking, not only of Jeffrey Epstein, and not only 01:3766 6 And let's be clear, I know Mr. Dershowitz had\n01:35:46 7 of the four women who were identified, but -- and this 01:37:58 7 said at some points like, I'm an attorney, and that's my\n01:35:49 8 is a direct quote: Any other potential co-conspirator, 01:38:00 8 client and so forth. And Alessi said, no, but this was\n01:35:53 9 close quote. 01:38:03 9 not in a -- in a lawyer/client capacity; this is in a\n01:35:55 10 And so that was unusual because what it -- 01:38:09 10 friend capacity.\n01:35:57 11 what it seemed to be doing was that somehow this 01:38:10 11 And so now we have Alessi putting him there\n01:3568 12 agreement was quite out of the normal and had been 01,38:1212 at the same time when young girls were there. And one\n01:36:00 13 designed to extend immunity to other people that might 01:38:15 13 of the -- the -- the things that I picked up, so is\n01:36:04 14 have been associated with Epstein. 01:38:17 14 Alessi -- you know, is he able to figure out who these\n01:36:05 15 And I knew that that category included the 01:38:19 15 girls are?\n01:36:09 16 people that were involved in negotiating this highly 01:38:20 16 A photograph of Virginia Roberts is shown to\n01:36:11 17 unusual provision included Mr. Dershowitz, who had been 012822 17 Juan Alessi in the deposition, and he I.D.s the\n01:36:14 18 heavily involved, not only in the drafting of the 01,38:26 18 photograph as, you know, V.R., so he -- he had, you\n01:36:18 19 agreement, but had also been involved remarkably in 01:38:30 19 know, put two and two together.\n01:3622 20 attacking the credibility of these girls and saying 0128:30 20 So now I've got V.R. coming to the house at a\n01:36:25 21 things like, you know, it was -- Epstein wasn't 0128:34 21 time when Mr. Dershowitz is also in the house, and\n01:36:28 22 targeting minor girls, which just struck -- you know, I 01:38:37 22 apparently spending, you know, two to three nights there\n01:36:33 23 was -- I don't want to use a technical term, 01:38:40 23 and doing this four or five times a year.\n01:36:35 24 gob-smocked, that a defense attorney with an obligation 01:38:45 24 Now, Alessi wasn't the only one. There was\n01:36:37 25 to tell the truth was making a factual representation\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n01:38:48 25 Alfredo Rodriguez who was there in about 2004 to 2005,\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n86 88\n01:36:42 1 that Jeffrey Epstein was not targeting minor girls, when 01:3863 1 after the time period of Virginia Roberts, but it's part\n01:36:44 2 the Palm Beach Police Department had collected, you 01:38:56 2 of the common scheme or plan that we've been discussing\n01:3647 3 know, 23 of them that had all given essentially 01:38:59 3 here.\n01:36:50 4 interlocking stories about how they had all gone over to 01:3659 4 And so in 2005, Alfredo Rodriguez says, yeah,\n01:36:54 5 this house, you know, the mansion, to give a massage and 01:39:02 5 again, Mr. Dershowitz is there at a time when these\n01:36:57 6 when they had gotten there, they had been sexually 01:39:05 6 massages are going on. When you start to look at Alessi\n01:36:58 7 abused. 01:39:09 7 and Rodriguez's statements in context where they're --\n01:3658 8 So the kingpin wouldn't talk. The next 01:39:14 8 they're saying he's there at the same time the massages\n01:37:01 9 echelon of the trafficking organization wouldn't talk. 01:3616 9 are occurring, and with the West Palm Beach Police\n01:37:03 10 So the next step was to say, okay, let's see if we can 01:39:19 10 Department reports showing that massages are of a sexual\n01:37:06 11 find somebody, you know, lower level in there, you know, 01:39:22 11 nature, again, it started to put two and two together.\n01:37:08 12 a household employee or something like that; maybe they 01:3626 12 One of the things that was particularly\n01:37:10 13 will have some information about, you know, what this 01:39:30 13 important about Rodriguez's situation was that Rodriguez\n0127:12 14 criminal organization is doing. 01:39:34 14 had an access to what's been called the little black\n01:37:14 15 Now, let's -- let's understand, you know, 01:3938 15 book, or I think he referred to it as the holy grail.\n01:37:16 16 given the pervasiveness of the -- of the criminal 01:39:40 16 This was Jeffrey Epstein's, you know, telephone book\n01:37:19 17 activity, I -- I wasn't convinced that they were going 01:39:42 17 where he had telephone numbers in it.\n01:3721 18 to be able to get in there and start saying exactly what 01:39:45 18 And so Rodriguez had that and, you know, I\n01:3724 19 was going on because they might well be exposing 01:3648 19 guess thought that this would be worth a lot of money\n01:37:26 20 themselves to criminal -- you know, criminal 01:3650 20 because it would -- you know, it would identify all of\n01:3729 21 culpability. 01:3652 21 the people that have been sexually abused by -- by\n01:37:30 22 But I -- I was able to read a sworn 01:3654 22 Jeffrey Epstein. And so he tried to sell it. The FBI\n01:37:32 23 deposition from Juan Alessi, and Juan Alessi -- I 01:3657 23 busted him for that.\n01:37:37 24 think -- I don't know. Maybe just to speed things up 01:39:58 24 And when the FBI busted him, now he's got\n01:37:38 25 today, I won't go through all the things that are -- 01:40:00 25 this book. And so the book went to Alessi, and\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM Page 85 to 88 of 151 22 of 38 sheets\n89 91\n01:40:05 1 according to a -- to a later FBI report, Alessi 01A2:32 1 a lot of money. I mean, Epstein was identified as a\n01A0'.07 2 identified information that was pertinent to the FBI's 01:42:32 2 billionaire in this article, billionaire with -- with a\n01A0:07 3 investigation. 01:4Z38 3 B, so the record is clear.\n01:40:11 4 And so when I look at the little black book 01A2:39 4 But he said, look, if Epstein lost all his\n01:40:14 5 that I have seen copies of, there are a handful of names 01:42:43 5 money -- I'm paraphrasing here -- I would be, you know,\n01:40:17 6 in that black book that have been circled, apparently by 01A2.44 6 happy to walk down, you know, the Coney Island Boardwalk\n01:40:22 7 Mr. Rodriguez, and one of the names that's -- that has 01:42:47 7 with him and discuss things with him, as -- you know,\n01:40:25 8 been circled is Alan Dershowitz. And so that, to me, 01:42:49 8 even if he didn't have any money.\n01:40:30 9 was suggesting that Mr. Rodriguez had identified, you 01A2:50 9 So now I'm seeing Dershowitz is a very close\n01:40:35 10 know, Alan Dershowitz as somebody who had information 01:42:54 10 personal friend of Jeffrey Epstein. And then I started\n01:40:38 11 about this -- this international sex trafficking ring. 01:42:58 11 to look at flight logs. There were -- there were some\n01:40:40 12 But just as a side note, but an important 01:43:01 12 very interesting things that I noticed on the flight\n01:40:42 13 note, when the -- the thing that was circled on the Alan 01:43:04 13 logs.\n01:40:46 14 Dershowitz page was not a single phone number 01:43:04 14 One of the things I noticed was when I began\n01A0:49 15 indicating, you know, somebody had bumped -- you know, 01:43:07 15 to, you know, get into this, that, you know, I was\n01,40-51 16 Epstein had bumped into at one point. I believe there 01:43:13 16 wondering, well, what -- well, how do these flight logs\n01:40:56 17 were 10 or 11 phone numbers that were associated with 01'4314 17 come into the possession of, you know, law enforcement\n01:40:57 18 Mr. Dershowitz that had all been circled and an e-mail 01:43:16 18 agencies? And the answer turned out to be that they had\n01:41:00 19 address as well. 01:4320 19 been provided by Epstein's defense attorney and -- and,\n01:41:02 20 So that started to corroborate my sense that 01:4323 20 you know, coincidentally, I suppose, or in my mind,\n01'41:05 21 Mr. Dershowitz was, indeed, a very close friend of\n01:43:27 21 suspiciously, they were not provided by just any defense\n01:41:10 22 Jeffrey Epstein. Now, I had then continued to do -- 01A3:30 22 attorney on this rather large defense team. They were\n01:41:14 23 there's been reference today to, you know, using Google 01:43:33 23 provided by one attorney according to Detective Recarey.\n01:41:16 24 to do research and so forth. So I Googled Jeffrey 01:43:36 24 Detective Recarey testified under oath that the flight\n01:41:20 25 Epstein and one of the things that pops up rather 01:43:39 25 logs were provided to him by Alan Dershowitz.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331.4400 (954) 331-4400\n90 92\n01A1:22 1 rapidly is an article in Vanity Fair. 01:43:41 1 So one of the things that was -- was\n01:41:25 2 And what you see in that article is, you 01:43:43 2 interesting is, Dershowitz has had access to these\n01:41:28 3 know, discussion about Mr. Epstein, but when you're 01:43:45 3 flight logs, and now I'm beginning to wonder, well, has\n01:41:33 4 trying to do a profile of someone, you try to figure out 01:43:48 4 there been an opportunity to sanitize those flight logs\n01:41:34 5 who that person's closest friends are. 01:43:50 5 or remove any incriminating information?\n01:41:35 6 And so the Vanity Fair author had gone to 01:43:52 6 And -- and one of the things that was\n01:41:38 7 Alan Dershowitz, you know, our -- Mr. Dershowitz here, 01,43:54 7 interesting about the flight logs that were produced --\n01:41:42 8 and had asked him, hey, what do you know about Jeffrey 01:4356 8 I believe just so the record is clear, that was Exhibit\n01:41:45 9 Epstein? 01:44:02 9 1 that -- if we could -- if I could refer -- I need to\n01:41:46 10 And, again, off the top of my head, you want 01A4104 10 refresh my recollection as to -- well, I don't -- you\n01:41:47 11 to know what I can remember right now. What I can 01:44:07 11 may not want me to look at documents.\n01:41A9 12 remember right now is that in the Vanity Fair article, 01'44:08 12 It was either Exhibit 1 or 2 this morning\n0141:53 13 the -- in the Vanity Fair article, Mr. Dershowitz said, 01:44:11 13 during Dershowitz's deposition which was covering a time\n01:41:59 14 I've written 20-some odd books; there's only one person 01:44:15 14 period of January to, I believe, September 2005. These\n01A2:03 15 outside my immediate family with whom I share drafts, 01:44:20 15 were flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to\n0142:06 16 and that's Jeffrey Epstein. 01:44:23 16 the Palm Beach Police Department.\n01.42:08 17 So I took that as indicating a -- a very 01:44:25 17 And you wonder why did they stop in\n01:42:10 18 close personal association that -- you know, among the 01A4.27 18 September -- you know, why stop in September 2005?\n01:42'13 19 people that -- that obviously he's sharing this -- these\n01:44'31 19 What's the significance of that? Well, later on,\n01A2:15 20 kinds of things that he wants evaluated before he shares 01:44'35 20 additional flight logs were obtained, and sure enough,\n01:42:18 21 them with the broader world, there's his immediate 01:44:39 21 who shows up on an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey\n01:42:21 22 family and then there's -- there's Jeffrey Epstein. 01:44:45 22 Epstein? Mr. Dershowitz.\n01:4223 23 There was also another similar quote in the 01:44:46 23 So that led to a suspicion that\n01:42:24 24 article that indicated that -- that Mr. Dershowitz said 01:44:49 24 Mr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police\n01:42:29 25 that he wasn't interested in Epstein just because he had 01:44:52 25 Department flight logs that, the time period of which\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n23 of 38 sheets Page 89 to 92 of 151 10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n93 95\n01:44:54 1 for the production had been carefully crafted to keep 01:46:33 1 THE WITNESS: Right. No, I mean, I want to\n01:44:57 2 him out of it; in other words, to not produce the 01:48:36 2 make -- I want to make clear that there was a lot\n01:4459 3 October 2005 version. 01:46:37 3 of information that I was relying on in filing\n01:45:03 4 The other thing I -- I began to discover as I 01,46:40 4 this pleading, and -- and, of course, the later\n01:45:05 5 started going through some flight logs, Dave Rogers, who 01:46.42 5 pleading. So we are on the subject of flight\n01:45:08 6 is one of I think about three pilots that -- that 01:46:44 6 logs.\n01:4610 7 Epstein regularly relied on to fly his -- you know, he 01:46:44 7 Flight logs showed that the flight logs\n01:45:13 8 had very fancy -- to use the technical term -- jets. 01:4646 8 Mr. Dershowitz had produced to Detective Recarey\n01:45:18 9 There were about -- there were about three pilots there. 01:46:49 9 were incomplete and inaccurate. And so that led\n01:45:20 10 One of them had some flight logs and that -- 01:46:52 10 to concern on my part that Mr. Dershowitz had had\n01:45:24 11 that was Pilot Dave Rogers, if I'm recalling his name 01:46:55 11 an opportunity to sanitize the flight logs,\n01:45:26 12 correctly. And so later on in the litigation, the sex 01:46:57 12 had -- had -- had provided incomplete production,\n01:45:30 13 abuse litigation against Epstein, flight logs were 01:47:01 13 you know, obviously, very important production\n01:45:34 14 obtained from Dave Rogers, and it was possible to -- to 01:47:02 14 that the Palm Beach Police Department was looking\n01'4637 15 compare -- I'm sorry. I don't mean to -- I want to make 01:47:05 15 at.\n01:4640 16 sure I get -- you know, the question is: How much can -I\n01:47:06 16 Then we got some additional flight logs from\n01:45:42 17 remember and I'm trying to make sure I get -- get it all 01:47:09 17 Dave Rogers. And what those flight logs\n01:45:44 18 in. 01:47:11 18 showed -- first off, let's talk again about\n01:45:45 19 And so the flight logs were produced from 01:47:14 19 the -- the production of those flight logs.\n01:45:48 20 Dave Rogers. And so Dave Rogers produced some flight 01:4717 20 My recollection is that Dave Rogers's flight\n01:45:51 21 logs, and some of the flights that he produced logs for 01:4721 21 logs were provided by Bruce Reinhart who was a\n01:45:56 22 coincided with the logs that Mr. Dershowitz had provided 01:47:24 22 former Assistant U.S. Attorney who had been\n01:45:59 23 to the Palm Beach Police Department, and there were 0147-26 23 inside the Southern District of Florida Office at\n01:46:01 24 inconsistencies. And so that, again, aroused my 01:47:29 24 a time when the Epstein case was the subject of\n01:46:05 25 suspicion that maybe Mr. Dershowitz when he had -- 01:47:32 25 regular discussion in that office.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n94 96\n01:46:08 1 MR.

And she had\n01:5065 21 in front of the United States Supreme Court, and 01:52:36 21 asked questions about Alan Dershowitz in those\n01:50:07 22 arguing for the Democratic Presidential 01:52:39 22 depositions, but had not asked questions about\n0150:10 23 Candidate, Al Gore, was David Boies. 01:52:42 23 other academics in those depositions.\n01:50:12 24 He had put his credibility on the line in 01524524 So that led me to conclude that Bob\n01:5016 25 arguing the Bush versus Gore case, and without 01:52:51 25 Josefsberg and his outstanding law firm had\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n25 of 38 sheets Page 97 to 100 of 151 10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n101 103\n01:52:51 1 identified Alan Dershowitz as someone who had 02:0923 1 let me clear all of that misunderstanding up.\n01:52:54 2 information relevant -- and let's be clear, that 02:0925 2 You know, that's -- frankly, if I had gotten\n01,52:56 3 this is not a lawsuit about some contract dispute 020928 3 something like that, that's what I would have\n01:52:58 4 or something -- that he was someone who had 02.09:29 4 said.\n01:53:00 5 information relevant to the sexual abuse of 02:0030 5 The answer that came back was -- from\n01:53102 6 underage girls and, indeed, they were asking 02:09:32 6 Mr. Dershowitz was something along the lines of,\n01:53:05 7 questions about what information -- what 020134 7 if I remember correctly, well, tell me what\n01:53:07 8 information he might have. 02:0136 8 you -- you -- tell me what you want to know and\n01:53:09 9 Another -- I know, I remember now, there's a 02:09:38 9 I'll decide whether to cooperate, was I think\n01:53:11 10 whole other line of things that -- that I had in 02:0041 10 the phrase that was used. And -- and so there\n01:53:13 11 mind at the time, and I think since you want to 020043 11 was an attempt, you know, a 2009 attempt, a 2011\n010316 12 test my memory -- I'm not -- let me be clear. 02:09:46 12 attempt to get information from Mr. Dershowitz.\n01:5319 13 I'm not claiming I have a superb memory. I have 02:09:49 13 Then there was another subpoena without\n01:53:21 14 an average memory, but this is a subject that's 02:09:52 14 deposition for -- for documents. You know, we\n01:5322 15 very important to me, and so I've worked, you 0209:54 15 have heard a lot about records in this case that\n01:53:26 16 know, very hard to get all the information. 02:09:57 16 could prove innocence. There was a records\n01:53:31 17 I would like to take a break. 02:09:58 17 request to Mr. Dershowitz in 2013. And, again,\n01:53:32 18 MR. SCAROLA: Sure.

She managed to escape and was hiding\n02:08:14 3 that is available to support her. 02:10:31 3 out in -- in Australia, and that she would --\n02:08:16 4 The next thing that I was thinking of was, 02:10:35 4 that somehow, you know, Mr. Scarola and\n02:08:19 5 all right, then the question is: Well, what does 02:1038 5 Mr. Edwards were able to reach her and there was\n02.08:23 6 Mr. Dershowitz have to say about all this? So I 02:10:41 6 a telephone call that was made.\n02:08:27 7 started to look at the information on that as 0210:43 7 And in that telephone call she identified\n02:08:28 8 well. 02:10:46 8 Alan Dershowitz as someone who would have\n02:08:29 9 In 2009, there had been a deposition request 0210;48 9 relevant information about Jeffrey Epstein and\n02:08:34 10 sent to Mr. Dershowitz, and I -- I saw a document 0210:50 10 the sexual abuse of underage girls.\n02:08:37 11 showing that that had actually been served on -- 02:10:53 11 And so I had that information as well. So\n02:08:40 12 on him, and, you know, to the extent that what I 0211,01 12 that, as I understand, the question was: What\n02:08:44 13 saw was a -- I think a receipt from the process 02:11:01 13 could I recall off the top of my head with regard\n02:08:48 14 server, or something along those lines, so I saw 02:11:05 14 to the factual basis for information connecting\n02:08:51 15 attempt to contact him in -- in 2009. 021107 15 Mr. Dershowitz with the sexual abuse of minor\n02:08:53 16 And then I saw an additional attempt to 02:11:12 16 girls, plural, and that, sitting here at this\n02:08:55 17 contact him in 2011. Mr. Scarola had sent him a 0211.15 17 moment, is the best that I can recall for the\n02:09:01 18 note and there was, you know, some back and 021118 18 information along those lines.\n02,09:03 19 forth. The -- the one note that -- that jumped 021118 19 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n02:0906 20 out to me was one in which Mr. Scarola had 02:1121 20 Q. Was that answer --\n02:09:09 21 written to Mr. Dershowitz, I think the phrase 02:11:21 21 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. Before -- before\n020912 22 was: Multiple witnesses have placed you in the 02,1123 22 you go on to another subject, Professor Cassell\n02:09:14 23 presence of Jeffrey Epstein and underage girls; I 0211:26 23 is entitled to refresh his recollection to give\n02:09:18 24 would like to depose you about those subjects. 02.11:29 24 you a complete response.

Yes. 02:13:21 10 Q. All right. Yeah. Let me just clarify one\n0211:44 11 Q. -- that would summarize -- 02:13:27 11 point before you do that.\n02:11:46 12 A. Right. 02:1127 12 A. Yes, sir.\n02:11:46 13 Q. -- your knowledge. 02:1327 13 Q. In your answer, were you referring to the\n0211:48 14 A. Right. 02:1128 14 evidence you could recall or the information you could\n02:11:48 15 Q. And now that you have exhausted your 02:13:30 15 recall that supported your allegations as to both\n32:11,51 16 recollection, could you produce that and let's just mark 02:13:34 16 Virginia Roberts and other minors, or were you treating\n3211:54 17 it -- 0213:36 17 those separately?\n02:11:54 18 A. Yeah, sure. 02:13:37 18 A. No, I was not treating those separately. I\n0211:55 19 Q. -- as an exhibit? 02113919 was -- for me, there's a common -- what -- what the law\n02:11:56 20 MR.

Now, there -- there are 0213:44 22 A. -- a criminal conspiracy for international\n0212:01 23 two parts to this -- 02:13:46 23 trafficking that involved not just a single girl, but\n02:12:02 24 MR.

So the answer was -- was with respect\n021102 25 then -- 02:1352 25 to -- to multiple girls.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n106 108\n02:12:04 1 THE WITNESS: Yeah. I just want the record 02:1153 1 Q. Okay. So I may have some questions to\n02:1106 2 to be clear, that I'm only looking -- there's -- 02:13:56 2 distinguish further between those two --\n02:12:07 3 there's a pre-December 30th section and a 02:13:57 3 A. Yes.\n02:12:10 4 post-December 30th section, so the top part is 02:1158 4 Q. -- but is it fair to say that -- and I\n0/12:13 5 the -- is what I was working off of. 02,14:02 5 realize you're going to refresh your recollection, but\n02:1113 6 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:14:05 6 that you had exhausted your recollection of the basis\n02:12:15 7 Q. Okay. 021407 7 for the allegation in this Exhibit 2, the motion to join\n0/1115 8 A. Now, underneath this is -- you know, if you 02:14:14 8 as to both Miss Roberts and other minors?\n0112:18 9 have questions about what happened after December 30th. 011417 9 A. Yes.\n02:12:19 10 Q. So you're -- you're prepared to produce the 02,1417 10 Q. Okay. So then, now, take a look at that and\n02:12:22 11 entire document, but you're clarifying? I don't -- I 02:14:20 11 tell me if there's anything there that refreshes your\n02:12:24 12 don't want to ask you -- if you're going to use it in 02:14:25 12 recollection as to something that you have not yet told\n02:12:26 13 your testimony, then we will mark the whole thing. 02:14:28 13 me about.\n021127 14 MR.

I'm going to ask 02:15:00 20 criminal conspiracy.\n011215 21 the court reporter to mark as Cassell Exhibit 3, 02:15:06 21 Oh, this refreshes my recollection that\n0112:39 22 a one-page document that the witness has just 0/15:08 22 Jeffrey Epstein had answered some questions in the civil\n02:12:42 23 handed to me. It's mostly typed. It has some 02:15,11 23 litigation. He provided, for example, names of -- of\n0112:44 24 handwriting on it. 02,15:15 24 some people who were involved, but he took the Fifth\n02:12:45 25 (Cassell I.D. Exhibit No. 3 - one-page 02:15:18 25 when asked -- he took -- he provided names of some\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n27 of 38 sheets Page 105 to 108 of 151 10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM\n109 111\n021521 1 people who would have relevant information in the civil 02:1860 1 strategy to sort of stall the investigation to say:\n02:15:25 2 cases, but when asked in deposition about 0218:03 2 Well, we will get you Epstein; oh, we can't meet now;\n02:1629 3 Mr. Dershowitz, he took the Fifth. 02:18:03 3 oh, we will get it now -- and then -- and so forth.\n02:15:31 4 So I -- I found it significant that for some 021864 4 And one of the things that I noted from all\n02:15:33 5 people, he was willing to answer questions, but with 02:18:06 5 that was that Mr. Dershowitz, as Mr. Epstein's attorney,\n0215:35 6 regard to Mr. Dershowitz, he took his -- he invoked his 02:18:09 6 never ultimately produced Epstein for a meeting with the\n02:15:39 7 Fifth Amendment right against compelled 0218:14 7 Palm Beach Police Department, having made another offer.\n02:15:41 8 self-incrimination presumably because revealing what he 021817 8 Now, obviously, something could have happened\n02:15:44 9 knew about Mr. Dershowitz would, you know, cause 02:18:19 9 there. I mean, I don't -- you know, I don't know what\n02:15:48 10 criminal -- criminal charges potentially to be filed 02:18:21 10 was the communications and so forth, but as an attorney\n02:15:51 11 against him. 02:18:24 11 trying to get information and unable to do that, I had\n021652 12 There was a common scheme or plan, and I'll 02:18:26 12 to make some reasonable inferences.\n021608 13 elaborate on that in a moment, but yeah, one of -- so 02:18:29 13 And so one of the inferences I began to draw\n02:16:14 14 this was another point. I mentioned that -- that there 021631 14 was that this was a stall tactic by Mr. Dershowitz, and\n0216:17 15 had been three efforts to get information from 02:18734 15 in my view, potentially, an unethical one, but I\n021518 16 Mr. Dershowitz by way of a 2009 deposition request, a 02:1637 16 don't -- I don't think we need to get into that in this\n02:16:23 17 2011 deposition request, and further follow-up 02:18:39 17 litigation.\n02:16:26 18 correspondence from counsel on that, and a 2013 document 02:18:40 18 What I saw was a stall tactic going on,\n02:16:31 19 request all propounded to Mr. Dershowitz that had not 02:18:44 19 and -- and the reason I think it was a stall tactic, as\n02:16:34 20 gone answered. 02:18:46 20 we are sitting here now in, what is it, October of 2015,\n021635 21 Yeah, and this was -- yeah, I'm sorry, this 02:1651 21 and Mr. Epstein has never been willing to answer\n0216:37 22 slipped my mind at the time -- but when -- when we saw 0218:54 22 questions about his sexual abuse of these girls.\n02:164O 23 Mr. Dershowitz not responding to these answers, you 02:1868 23 And this was back in around -- what was it?\n02:16:44 24 know, maybe the mail didn't get delivered to him or 02:19.01 24 I guess it would be 2005, 2006, you know, roughly a\n021646 25 something like that. I don't -- I suppose that's, you 0219:04 25 decade ago, Mr. Dershowitz was offering to make Epstein\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n110 112\n02:18:48 1 know, a theoretical possibility. 02:1607 1 available. And then that never happened, and given the\n02:18:50 2 But -- but the reason I ruled out that 02:1511 2 ten-year pattern that -- that developed -- I guess I\n02:1652 3 possibility, first, it didn't seem likely; but secondly, 02:1612 3 should go back. I'm sorry. Let me correct my answer.\n02:16:55 4 there was a pattern of Mr. Epstein's associates evading 02:19:14 4 We should go back to December 30th, 2014. So\n0216:59 5 efforts to get information from them. 02:19:17 5 there -- there appeared to be about an eight-year period\n021762 6 And so let me just go back to the earliest 021621 6 of time during which Mr. Epstein had refused to answer\n0217:05 7 instance of that. According to the Chief of Police in 021924 7 any questions about his sexual abuse of girls and yet,\n02:17:07 8 the Palm Beach -- of the Palm Beach Police Department, 021929 8 Mr. Dershowitz said, oh, it's just a scheduling issue\n02:1711 9 Mr. Dershowitz had said that he would make available 02:1630 9 and -- and we will get the Palm Beach Police Department\n0217:14 10 Mr. Epstein for questions about the -- the sex, you 021633 10 to -- to, you know, to meet and -- and learn all this.\n02:17:18 11 know, abuse that was going on. And, you know, 0219:37 11 The other thing that I'm -- that I'm seeing\n02:17:21 12 Mr. Dershowitz had said to the Palm Beach Police 02:19:39 12 here, so now there's -- there's -- Mr. Dershowitz had\n021723 13 Department, yeah, we will make him available; no, we got 02:1642 13 been involved in concealing Mr. Epstein from the Palm\n0217:25 14 to reschedule it; you know, and then another time, 02:19:46 14 Beach Police Department, but there were others that had\n0217:28 15 reschedule, another time. And so there were multiple -- 02:1647 15 done similar sorts of things.\n02:17:32 16 according to the Chief of Police, there had been 0219:49 16 So one of them was a Ghislaine Maxwell. I\n02:17:34 17 multiple, you know, requests to interview Mr. Epstein 02:19:55 17 will just call her Glenn Maxwell. I think that's kind\n021738 18 and Mr. Dershowitz had repeatedly said: Oh, yeah, we 02:19:55 18 of the nickname I understand she goes by.\n02:17:41 19 will schedule that, and then it hadn't happened. 02:19:59 19 So Glenn Maxwell -- remember, she is -- she\n0217:43 20 Now, obviously, there could have been a 021969 20 is the one, you know, I think the record is clear, in --\n82.17:45 21 situation there where, you know, an emergency had come 02:20:03 21 in -- in litigation that, you know, an allegation has\n0217:47 22 up for Mr. Epstein and he wasn't able to make a schedule 02:20:06 22 been made that she was the one that -- that brought\n0217:49 23 or something like that. But what I saw was a -- was a 02:20708 23 Virginia Roberts into the -- into the sex trafficking,\n0217:52 24 pattern of offers to -- to meet and then withdrawals, 0220:1224 and was heavily involved with -- you know, on all the --\n0217:55 25 and that seemed to me to be a deliberately calculated 0220:15 25 not all the flights, but on many of the flights with\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:07:28 PM Page 109 to 112 of 151 28 of 38 sheets\n113 115\n0220:17 1 Jeffrey Epstein where -- where this seemed to be going 02:2228 I what his excuse was, but, you know, evaded the\n022019 2 on and was very close to Epstein, staying at the mansion 02:22:31 2 deposition and, in fact, later information came to light\n02:20:22 3 frequently. 02:2233 3 he was hiding out in, you know, in the mansion of\n02:20:23 4 And so she would, obviously, be -- I guess if 02:22:35 4 Epstein while he's claiming he's unavailable for -- for\n02:20:25 5 you have Epstein at the -- the top of the -- you know, 02:22:39 5 deposition.\n02:20:27 6 the kingpin of the operation, Maxwell would be, you 02:22:39 6 So -- so this pattern of Mr. Dershowitz, you\n0220:30 7 know, a close second or certainly at, you know, the 02:22:42 7 know, where there were three attempts to obtain\n022012 8 higher echelon. 02:22:44 8 information from him, if that's all I had, I guess that\n02:20:33 9 So, obviously, someone who would have, you 022246 9 would have been one thing.

It sounds\n02:21,00 19 that some of the girls had filed against Mr. Epstein, 0223:17 19 kind of farfetched.\n0221:02 20 her deposition was set, in fact, by my co-counsel, 02:23:18 20 Well -- well, one of the things that I had\n02:21:05 21 Mr. Edwards, and then there was some haggling over a 0223:19 21 available to me on December 30th was a photograph that\n02:21:10 22 confidentiality agreement, you know, what are we 0223:22 22 was widely available on the Internet, and that\n02:21:12 23 gonna -- and that had all been worked out, and then she 02:23:26 23 photograph depicted three people.\n02:21:14 24 was set for a deposition and finally agreed, you know, 02:23:28 24 It depicted Glenn Maxwell, Prince Andrew, and\n02:2116 25 to a deposition. 022134 25 Virginia Roberts, and the -- at the time that it looked\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n114 116\n02:21:17 1 And just shortly, you know, I think a couple 0223:38 1 like Virginia Roberts was an underage girl. She was not\n022119 2 of days before that deposition, she canceled. And well, 02:23:43 2 dressed in formal attire. And Prince Andrew had his arm\n02:2023 3 she didn't cancel. Her -- her attorney called to cancel 02:23:47 3 around her, I think if memory serves, and right next --\n0221:26 4 the deposition and represented that Miss Maxwell was 02:23:52 4 smiling in the background is Miss Maxwell, and it\n02:21:30 5 outside the United States of America and had no plans to 02:23:54 5 appeared that that was a private residence, presumably\n02:2113 6 return back to the United States. 02:2157 6 in London, close to Buckingham Palace where -- where\n0221:35 7 And so, at that point, the deposition was -- 0224,00 7 Prince Andrew lived.\n02:21,40 8 was not able to go forward. But it turned out that she 02:24:01 8 And so here was Prince Andrew with this\n02:21:43 9 had not left the United States for an extended period of 02,24:03 9 underage girl with Glenn Maxwell, the -- the right-hand\n02:21:46 10 time. She was spotted later at a wedding of a prominent 0224:05 10 girl, if that's the right expression -- I probably\n02:21:49 11 person in New York. 0224:07 11 should say -- strike that -- right-hand woman of --\n02:21:50 12 And so that was Maxwell fitting into this 022411 12 of -- of Mr. Epstein -- that were there and somebody had\n02:21:52 13 pattern of, you know, Epstein was being told -- you 02:24:16 13 taken the photograph.\n02:21:56 14 know, the Palm Beach Police Department being told by 02:24:17 14 Given the surrounding circumstances, I\n02:21:57 15 Dershowitz that Epstein will answer your questions, and 022419 15 thought perhaps Mr. Epstein had taken the photograph.\n02:22:00 16 then, you know, not -- not getting information, Maxwell 02:24:21 16 So that would have shown Virginia Roberts's sexual abuse\n02:2203 17 evading the deposition. 02:2424 17 was not confined just to Florida, not confined to the\n02:22:06 18 Jean Luc Brunel was another person who seemed 02:24:27 18 New York mansion; it would have -- it would have\n02:2209 19 to be very much involved in -- in trafficking the girls, 02:24:31 19 presumably continued into London where one of, you know,\n02:22:10 20 and it was the same situation.

What flight logs have you reviewed; how would\n00:31:10 18 complaint against Miss Roberts, who is also your client, 003107 18 you describe them?\n0011:12 19 to be significant to your evaluation of the case? 00:33:08 19 A. Both Exhibit 1 and Exhibit 2 that were shown\n0031:15 20 A. Yes. 00:33:13 20 to Mr. Dershowitz yesterday.\n00:31:15 21 Q. And if it -- if that was significant to 00:33:15 21 Q. If -- I believe those were Exhibits 6 and\n00:31:18 22 evaluation of the case, why are you telling us you don't 00:33:19 22 7 --\n0011.20 23 normally talk with attorneys in Florida? Doesn't he 00:33:19 23 A. Okay.\n00:31:25 24 represent -- at one point, represent the same client? 00:33:19 24 Q. -- but can we agree that flight logs were\n00:31:26 25 A.

The two composite exhibits of flight\n00:31:29 2 speaking with -- at least within the realm of something 00:33:26 2 logs I had examined previously.\n0011:33 3 one might expect for you to speak? 00:33:27 3 Q. Okay. So the same documents that Professor\n00:31:35 4 A. If I were a solo representative of Virginia 003130 4 Dershowitz was shown at his deposition; is that right?\n0011:38 5 Roberts, that would be the case, but I think you're 00:3314 5 A.

There\n0011:46 8 this matter. 003146 8 may have also been an earlier review at an earlier --\n00:31:47 9 So I think it would be obvious that if 00:3153 9 earlier time, but I definitely remember reviewing them\n00:31:50 10 there's a division of labor, it might not be along the 0013:55 10 in May -- approximately May 2014.\n0031:53 11 lines that you're suggesting. And I can't go any 00:33:58 11 Q. Would -- do you -- isn't it true that those\n0031:55 12 further without going into work product and other issues 00:34:02 12 flight logs support Professor Dershowitz's testimony\n0011:59 13 surrounding Miss Roberts' representation. 0014,07 13 that he was never on a plane with Virginia Roberts?\n00:32:01 14 Q.

And, 00:51:14 13 believe that there's sufficient -- I have a sufficient\n00:48:56 14 again, you know, this -- I understand sometimes people 00:51:17 14 basis for believing at this point in time, that\n00'4869 15 may go away from their wife, but the American Lawyer 00:51:19 15 Mr. Dershowitz has, indeed, provided inaccurate\n00:49:01 16 was, obviously, on January 15th, 2015, asking about: 0651:22 16 information to -- to law enforcement agencies, or at a\n00:49:05 17 Well, have you been outside the presence of your wife in 00:51:25 17 minimum has provided -- has produced inaccurate\n00:49:08 18 situations where you might have interacted with Virginia 00:51:29 18 information through circumstances beyond his control.\n00:49:10 19 Roberts? And that was the answer that he gave to the 00:51:32 19 But when he continually represents that the\n00:49:12 20 American Lawyer. 00:51:34 20 information is accurate and exonerates him, I believe\n00:49:13 21 And based on -- on my review of the flight 00:51:37 21 that that is a deliberately false statement.\n00:49:15 22 logs, I thought that was, again, a deliberate effort to 00:51:41 22 MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike the answer --\n00:49:20 23 obscure and try to exculpate himself from his 00,51:42 23 the nonresponsive portion of the answer.\n00:49:23 24 involvement in this international sex trafficking ring. 00:51:46 24 MR. SCAROLA: Which portion is that?\n00:49:26 25 The -- he also said yesterday: Nobody knows 00:51:47 25 MR. SIMPSON: 99 percent of it. I think at\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n201 203\n00:49:33 1 about Prince Andrew and Virginia, except for the two of 00:51:50 1 the end, we got to the flight logs.\n00:49:36 2 them. And, again, I thought that was at a minimum, 00:51:52 2 I move to strike the nonresponsive portion.\n00:49:39 3 deliberately mis -- misleading information and more 00:51:54 3 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n00:49:41 4 likely deliberately false information, because 00:51:55 4 Q. Mr. Cassell, you came here today looking for\n00:49:43 5 Mr. Dershowitz was aware of the photograph and had long 00:51:57 5 an opportunity to give that statement; did you not?\n00:49:47 6 been aware of the photograph that shows Prince Andrew 00:51:59 6 A. If it was relevant to an answer I was giving,\n0649:50 7 with his arm around Virginia Roberts, standing next to a 00:52:03 7 yes.\n00:49:53 8 beaming Glenn Maxwell who has been involved in this 00:52:03 8 Q. The answer to my question is, yes, you came\n00:4966 9 international sex trafficking organization. 00:52:05 9 here today looking for a question to which you could\n00:49:59 10 And in the circumstances of that photograph, 0652:08 10 respond with that prepared statement?\n00:50:01 11 it seems quite likely that the photographer who took 00:52:10 11 A. I was prepared to give that -- I anticipated\n00:50;04 12 that picture was the head of the international sex 00:52:13 12 that a very good attorney for Mr. Dershowitz might ask a\n00:50:07 13 trafficking ring, Jeffrey Epstein. And so for him to 00:5215 13 question where that would be relevant. And if that\n00:50:10 14 say that only two people knew what went on was, again, 00:52:18 14 question were asked and I was given the opportunity to\n00:5014 15 deliberately false information, because I know he is the 00:52:20 15 make that statement, I wanted to be prepared to give it\n0650:17 16 attorney for Jeffrey Epstein, and he could have asserted 00:52:23 16 in the most accurate way that I could.\n00:50:20 17 attorney/client privilege over that, said, I can't get 00:52:25 17 MR. SIMPSON: I would like the reporter to\n00:50:22 18 into my communications with my client about what he was 00:52:27 18 mark as Exhibit -- are we up to 4 -- Exhibit 4,\n00:50:25 19 doing with Prince Andrew. 00:52:31 19 the document that Mr. Cassell was referring to.\n00:50:26 20 But instead he said, no one knows what 00:52:34 20 I'll let the reporter do that.\n00:50:29 21 happened, other than those two people in circumstances 00:52:36 21 THE WITNESS: Okay.\n00:50:31 22 where it was quite clear that there would have been 00:52:36 22 (Cassell's I.D.

My question, Mr. Cassell, is: You reviewed\n00:53:10 4 Professor Dershowitz's testimony, correct? 0065:11 4 the flight logs, correct?\n00:53:12 5 A. Correct. 00:55:12 5 A. Correct.\n0653,12 6 Q. I'm trying to look at my notes here of your 0055:12 6 Q. You reviewed them in some detail, correct?\n0653:28 7 long answer, but one thing you indicated that -- was the 00:55:14 7 A. Correct.\n00:53:30 8 fact that Professor Dershowitz gave long answers is 00:55:15 8 Q. Is there any entry on those flight lines -\n00:53'34 9 somehow indicative of false answers or perjury -- 00:5617 9 logs that you read as putting Professor Dershowitz and\n065314 10 MR. SCAROLA: That is -- 00:55:21 10 Miss Roberts on the same plane?\n00:53:34 11 BY MR. SIMPSON: 00:55:23 11 A. No.\n0653'19 12 Q. -- is that right? 00:5624 12 Q. And so your testimony about questions about\n00,53:39 13 MR. SCAROLA: That is an absolute 00:55:26 13 the completeness and accuracy of those flight logs goes\n00:53:40 14 mischaracterization of the statement that 00:55:33 14 to whether the logs are -- let me rephrase that.\n00:53:43 15 Professor Cassell made. He did not refer to the 00:55:39 15 The answer that you gave about your question\n0653:47 16 length of the answers, but rather their 00:55:43 16 as -- your views as to the completeness of the flight\n0653:47 17 nonresponsiveness. 00:55:47 17 logs and whether they may have been changed in some\n0653:47 18 BY MR. SIMPSON: 065650 18 ways, goes to whether those logs are conclusive, not\n00:53:52 19 Q. Let me -- let me ask a different question. 00:55:54 19 whether they, in fact, support Professor Dershowitz's\n00:53:55 20 Go back to the flight logs themselves. 00:55:5820 testimony that he was not on a plane with Virginia\n065367 21 A. Okay. 065662 21 Roberts?\n0653:57 22 Q. My initial question that got us going down 00:56:03 22 MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to object to the form\n03:54:01 23 this line was: Isn't it true that the flight logs 065664 23 of the question as vague and ambiguous. I don't\n00:54:05 24 themselves support Professor Dershowitz's testimony that 00:56:08 24 understand it.\n00:54:13 25 he was never on a plane with Virginia Roberts, the face\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n00,56:08 25 THE WITNESS: And I won't give a long answer,\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n205 207\n00:54:17 1 of the flight logs support that proposition? 065668 1 but I -- I think, as I previously indicated, you\n00:5420 2 A. The face of the flight logs for the relevant 00:5611 2 can't just look at the face of these documents\n00:54:23 3 period of time, we can call it the hot period of time or 006614 3 without -- with -- you know, against the context\n065425 4 whatever you want, did not reveal the presence of 0656:17 4 of an international sex trafficking ring that's\n00:54:27 5 Mr. Dershowitz on those flights, yes. 00:56:19 5 trying to cover up what it's doing. You cant\n00. 54:29 6 Q. Okay. So during the period -- well, 00:56:21 6 just look and documents and assume that they are\n0654,32 7 actually, there's no flight log that shows Virginia 0656:22 7 100 percent accurate without that -- having that\n00:54:34 8 Roberts and Professor Dershowitz on the same airplane, 00:5624 8 context in mind.\n00:54:37 9 correct? 00,56:20 9 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n00:54,37 10 A. That's my understanding, yes. 00:5626 10 Q. And so am I right, that on the face of the\n0054:39 11 Q. And -- 0656.29 11 flight logs, there's nothing showing Virginia Roberts\n00:54:39 12 MR. SCAROLA: By name. You're -- you're -- 0066:32 12 and Professor Dershowitz on the same plane?\n0654:39 13 MS.

To your knowledge, isn't it correct that 00:57:06 17 may have been changed, but you do not dispute, that on\n00:54:49 18 there is no flight log that's been produced in this case 00:57:10 18 their face, they support Professor Dershowitz's\n00:54:51 19 by any party that reflects Professor Dershowitz and 00:57,13 19 testimony?\n065465 20 Virginia Roberts on the same plane, as you read the 00:57714 20 MR.

McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to the\n00:57.45 15 question that what they show on their face supports 00:5048 15 extent it gets into any conversations that you\n00:57:48 16 Professor Dershowitz's testimony -- 00:59:49 16 had with Virginia on any of these issues.\n00:57:48 17 MS.

It's true, is it not, that you have no\n01,02:21 17 sure it was not intentional, and that's why I'm 01:16:12 17 personal knowledge as to whether Professor Dershowitz or\n01:02:25 18 calling it to your attention so that we don't go 01:1615 18 some other member of Jeffrey Epstein's defense team\n01:02:27 19 down a rabbit trail. 01:1621 19 prepared those logs for production to the government?\n01:02:30 20 MR.

In fact, I think you testified yesterday 01:1919 1 MS.

That's right. 011925 4 my office in -- while in Salt Lake City.\n01:16:48 5 Q. And so with respect to Professor Dershowitz's 01:19-25 5 BY MR.

And are you able to place in time when you\n01'16:57 7 acting unethically if he didn't attempt to negotiate the 01.19.29 7 reviewed these portions of the police report, other than\n0117:00 8 best resolution for his client that he could, consistent 0119:35 8 before December 30th of 2014?\n01:17.05 9 with the law; is that correct? 0119:37 9 A. Not precisely, no.\n0117:06 10 A. Right. Consistent with the law, yes. 01:1940 10 Q. And do I understand correctly from your\n0117:09 11 Q. And so you wouldn't -- 01:19-42 11 testimony yesterday that that police report is one of\n0117:09 12 A. I'm sorry. Let me just -- consistent with 01:19.47 12 the things you relied on to support making the\n01:1711 13 the law and with the ethical obligations of attorneys. 01_19:51 13 allegations against Professor Dershowitz that are\n01:17:14 14 Attorneys cannot make, for example, false 0119:54 14 included in the joinder motion?\n01:17:16 15 representations when they are negotiating those kinds of 01:19:56 15 A.

The duty as a defense counsel, 01:20:01 17 report includes an interview with an adult woman who was\n01.17:22 18 Professor Dershowitz's duty was to attempt to obtain the 0120:07 18 retained to provide massages at Jeffrey Epstein's\n01:1727 19 best resolution he could for Jeffrey Epstein consistent 01:20:11 19 residence for guests, among others; isn't that correct?\n01:17:31 20 with the law and legal ethics, correct? 01:20:14 20 A. I believe that's correct.\n01:17:34 21 A. That's correct. 01:20:16 21 Q. And based on that, is it your testimony that\n01:17:34 22 Q. And, in fact, if he had not done that, he 01:20:20 22 it's fair to presume that a reference that a guest got a\n01:17:39 23 would have been acting unethically, correct? 01:20:24 23 massage is a code word for abusing a minor sexually?\n01:17741 24 A. That's correct. 01:20:31 24 MR. SCAROLA: I'm sorry. Are you -- are you\n01:17:41 25 Q.

If you object to the form,\n01:17:58 3 represented someone accused of heinous crimes? 01:20:36 3 object to the form, and I -- if its not a proper\n01:18:01 4 A. Just the fact of representation alone? 0120:38 4 question --\n01:18:04 5 Q. Yes. 01:20.38 5 MR. SCAROLA: I want a clarification of the\n0118:04 6 A. Yeah, that's right.

As -- before December 30th of 2014, had you 01:2039 8 MR. SIMPSON: I -- the question --\n01:1818 9 reviewed the Palm Beach Police report? 01-20,41 9 MR. SCAROLA: -- of information?\n01:1822 10 A. Portions of it, yes. 0120:42 10 MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I am asking a question\n01:18:23 11 Q. Had you reviewed the entire report? 0120:45 11 that's perfectly clear. If you think it's\n01:18:25 12 A. I think I reviewed most of it, but I don't 0120:46 12 objectionable, it wont -- it will stand.\n0118'31 13 think I've gone through it page by page. 01:20'49 13 MR. SCAROLA: I'm going to object on the\n01:18:3214 Q. When did you do that? 01:20:5014 basis that it is vague and ambiguous. It is\n0118'35 15 A. Well, let's see. Before December 30th, 2014, 01:20:53 15 unclear whether you're asking for him --\n01:18:41 16 Brad and I filed the case in about July 2008, so it was 0120:55 16 MR. SIMPSON: Please don't coach the witness.\n01:18:49 17 about a six-year period of time, and I remember I'd been 01:20:56 17 MR. SCAROLA: -- to isolate -- to isolate his\n01:18:56 18 to Florida a couple of times on this case, once in 2010 01:20:59 18 focus to that single piece of evidence.\n01,19:03 19 and I think another a year or two later. And I 01:20:59 19 MR. SIMPSON: I object on the coaching of the\n01:19:07 20 remember, at least on one of those times, reviewing the 0121:01 20 witness.\n01:19:09 21 report here with -- I don't know if I can... 0121:01 21 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:1915 22 MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah. I wouldn't go into 01:21:02 22 Q. My question is: Is it reasonable,\n01:19:15 23 anything. 0121:06 23 considering that the police report on its face shows\n01:1915 24 THE WITNESS: To the -- right. So we just -- 012111 24 evidence -- let me back this up. Ask another question\n01:19:15 25 we just want to know -- 0121,16 25 to you.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n17 of 46 sheets Page 216 to 219 of 335 10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n220 222\n01:21:16 1 Are you aware that the police report reflects 01:23:34 1 A. That sounds accurate with the information I\n01:21:21 2 that the woman I referred to who was hired to give 01,23:37 2 have, yes, she doesn't sound like she would fit his\n01;2124 3 massages, told them that she never touched anyone 01:23:40 3 type.\n01:21:28 4 inappropriately? 01:23:40 4 Q. And so do you agree with me then --\n012129 5 A. I think that there are -- there is 01:23:42 5 A. And she's over the age of 18, which is\n0121:32 6 information along those lines in the police report, yes. 01:23:44 6 another reason why wouldn't fit his type, so...\n01:21:34 7 Q. Okay. And so do you acknowledge that the 01:2/47 7 Q. But you acknowledge that -- that this\n01:21:37 8 police report, on its face, reflects both reports of 01:23:50 8 woman -- that the police report reflects a woman over --\n01:21:41 9 massages that involved improper sexual contact -- 01:2154 9 well over the age of 18, being hired to give perfectly\n01:21:45 10 contact and massages that were perfectly legitimate? 01:23:57 10 legitimate massages, correct?\n0121:50 11 A. Yes, but not in the same proportion. 01:23:58 11 A. Yeah. That was cover for the sex trafficking\n01:21:54 12 Q. My question wasn't proportion. The -- the 01:24:01 12 that was going on.\n01:21:57 13 report on its face, you understood, reflected that there 01:24:01 13 Q. Okay. So you're now -- does the police\n01:22:01 14 were massages given at Mr. Epstein's residence that were 0124:04 14 report say \"it was cover\" --\n01:22:06 15 perfectly legitimate? 01:24:04 15 A. That was --\n01:22:08 16 A. Some -- it was basically a few isolated 01:24:05 16 Q. -- \"for the sex trafficking\"?\n0112:13 17 examples from what I could see. 01:24:07 17 A. That was my conclusion when I reviewed the\n0122:14 18 Q. So you would characterize what was said in 01:24:09 18 materials.\n01:22:18 19 the police report as \"a few isolated examples\"? 0124:09 19 Q. Okay. So your inclusion is that a\n01:2221 20 A. Well, given the backdrop that they had -- 01:24:11 20 fair-minded reader of the police report would come to\n012225 21 Q. No. My question -- it's a yes or no 01:24:14 21 that conclusion?\n01:22:26 22 question. Is that how you would characterize it? 01:24:15 22 A. December 30th of 2014, knowing what we know\n0122:27 23 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. The witness is not 01:24:18 23 now, yes.\n01:22:29 24 confined to answering yes or no, if yes or no 01:24:19 24 Q. Do you consider yourself a very suspicious\n01:22:31 25 would be misleading. 01:24:24 25 person?\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n01:22:33 1 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:24:25 1 A. No.\n221 223\n01:22:33 2 Q. It's a different position than was taken 01:24:25 2 Q. Do you consider yourself a conspira -- having\n01:22:35 3 previously, but -- 0124:31 3 a conspiratorial view?\n01:22:36 4 A. I mean, I was just going to give one 0124:31 4 A. Absolutely not.\n01:22:38 5 sentence, and the one sentence would be, in the context 01:24:34 5 Q. Do you consider yourself a crusader?\n01:22:41 6 of this whole police report where they had 24, 01:24:35 6 A. Well, crusader for justice, I would say, yes.\n01:22:44 7 approximately, minor girls who were -- who were being 01:24,41 7 Q. If -- let me put it this way: In your view,\n01:22:47 8 sexually abused, the references to legitimate massages I 01:24:49 8 is evidence that a person, any person, any guest at\n01:22:51 9 would view as isolated. 01:24:54 9 Mr. Epstein's house had a massage, evidence that that\n0122:53 10 Q. So you're coming to the conclusion, looking 0125:01 10 person engaged in criminal sexual conduct, contact with\n01:22:56 11 at the police report, that they are isolated; is that 01:25:07 11 minors, because of the fact of having a massage?\n0122:59 12 right? 01:25:13 12 A. You'd have to look at the context.\n01:225913 A. Yes. 01:25:16 13 Q. On its own, is it any evidence -- doesn't\n01:23:01 14 Q. And do you think a fair-minded reader of the 01:25:19 14 it -- is it any evidence at all, in your view?\n0123:04 15 police report would reach that conclusion? 01:2521 15 A. It would be some evidence, yes.\n01:23:05 16 A. Absolutely. 0125:22 16 Q. Notwithstanding that the report, on its face,\n01:23:07 17 Q. And were you aware that the police report, to 0125:26 17 reflects both legitimate and illegitimate massages?\n01:2112 18 give a bit more detail, reflected that a woman who was 01,25:30 18 A. The report on its face, let's be clear,\n01:23:14 19 described as having tattoos was hired to give 01:25:32 19 reflects a lot of illegitimate sag -- massages and a\n0123:17 20 deep-tissue Swedish massages. Do you recall that being 0125:36 20 sporadic or isolated, you know, legitimate massages. So\n01:23:20 21 in the -- in the police report? 01:25:38 21 the fact that somebody gets a massage in that context,\n01:23:22 22 A. Something along those lines, yes. 0125:42 22 I -- I think is -- is -- raises, you know, the concerns\n01:23:23 23 Q. And she also -- that woman also told the 01:25:45 23 we have been talking about.\n51:23:26 24 police that she was not Jeffrey Epstein's type, that she 01:25:47 24 Q. Did you, before December 30th of 2014,\n01:23:30 25 wasn't thin, had tattoos, didn't fit his type? 01:26:03 25 yourself personally, review what I think you referred to\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM Page 220 to 223 of 335 18 of 46 sheets\n224 226\n01:26:07 1 in your testimony yesterday as the holy grail, an 012829 1 Q. Would it be a reasonable inference, or a\n01:26,12 2 address book of Mr. Epstein? 01:28:36 2 possible reasonable inference to draw, that\n0126:17 3 A. Pieces of it, yes. 01:28:39 3 Mr. Rodriguez was trying to highlight people who would\n01:26:18 4 Q. Did you review the entire document? 0128:42 4 be of interest to the Press for purposes of selling the\n01:26:21 5 A. No. 0128:45 5 book?\n01:26:21 6 Q. Did I understand yesterday that you 0128:46 6 A. No, because he was not talking to the Press.\n01:26:25 7 testified -- did I understand correctly yesterday, that 01:28:49 7 He was talking to an FBI agent who had busted him for\n01:26:28 8 you testified that the fact that names were circled 01:28:52 8 criminal activity. And so I was assuming that what he\n01:26:33 9 indicated that those persons likely engaged in illegal 01:28,54 9 was trying to do, as many criminals do when they are\n0126:39 10 sexual contact with minors? 01:28:58 10 apprehended, was give information to law enforcement\n01:26:41 11 A. My -- my impression is the names that were 0129:01 11 agency that would be helpful so that they can catch\n0126:44 12 circled were circled by Alfredo Rodriguez when he was 0129:03 12 other \"bigger fishes\" is the phrase that's sometimes\n01:2647 13 busted by the FBI for involvement, and he was asked to 01:29:06 13 used, so that the little fish would -- would get off or\n01:26:51 14 identify those who would have information about the sex 0129:09 14 get a cooperation deal from the law enforcement agency.\n0126:54 15 trafficking organization. And my -- based on all the 0129:12 15 He was talking -- let's be clear. He was\n01:26:58 16 evidence I have, I believe the names that were circled 01:29:14 16 talking to somebody he understood was an FBI agent at\n01:27:00 17 were those who would have that kind of information. 01:29:17 17 the time, and so that was the context of the\n01:27:02 18 Q. So is it your testimony that if the name is 01,29:18 18 conversation.\n01:27:05 19 circled, it indicates that they have information, or 01:29:19 19 Q. Do you have any personal knowledge that WS\n01:2708 20 that they are criminals? 0128:22 20 in the context of talking to the FBI that Mr. Rodriguez\n01:27:09 21 A. That they would have information about the 0129:25 21 circled those names?\n01:2712 22 sex trafficking organization, and that would probably 0129:26 22 A. i have reviewed -- I know I could refresh my\n01:27:15 23 mean that they were part of the organization. It may 0129:30 23 recollection here, but there's an FBI 302, a report of\n01:27:18 24 mean that they were witnesses to what the organization 01:29:33 24 interview of the circumstances surrounding\n01:27:19 25 was doing. 0129:35 25 Mr. Rodriguez's arrest, and I believe I reviewed that\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n01:27:20 1 But they would have information that the FBI, 01:29:38 1 302.\n225 227\n01:2724 2 among other law enforcement agencies, should be 01:29:39 2 Q. Do you know whether the FBI, at any point,\n01:2726 3 following up on, if they are trying to piece together 01:29:47 3 contacted Professor Dershowitz to discuss any evidence\n01:27:28 4 what the sex trafficking organization was doing. 01:29:53 4 he might have after his name was circled on this\n01:27:32 5 Q. Would you agree that a fair-minded person, 01:29:56 5 document?\n0127737 6 with that background that you just described, would not 01:29:57 6 A. I don't have personal knowledge of what the\n01:27:41 7 go to the conclusion that the fact that a name is 01:29:58 7 FBI did to follow up after that.\n01:27:44 8 circled indicates that that person has engaged in 01:30:01 8 Q. Okay. One of the names that's circled in the\n0127:46 9 criminal conduct? 01:30:05 9 book is Courtney Love. Do you know who she is?\n01:27:48 10 A. They -- what it would indicate is that they 01:30:08 10 A. Not off the top of my head, no.\n01:27;51 11 had information relevant to criminal activity. Now, 01:30:12 11 Q. If I mention to you or if I represent that\n01:27:54 12 would they on the -- just the fact that a name was 01:3016 12 she's a famous actress, any reason to question that?\n01:27:55 13 circled, standing alone, reach that conclusion? 01:30:19 13 A. No.\n01:2759 14 Well, that's a hypothetical question because 0120:21 14 Q. In your view, was Courtney Love involved in\n01:28:01 15 obviously in this case, there's lots of other 01:30:25 15 sex trafficking?\n01:28:02 16 information. 01:30:26 16 A. i don't know.\n01:28:02 17 Q. Did you understand -- it is true, is it not, 01:30:27 17 Q. In your view, was Courtney Love a witness to\n01:28:06 18 that Mr. Rodriguez was trying to sell that book? 01:3022 18 sex trafficking?\n0128:09 19 A. That's true. 01:30,33 19 A. If -- is there a way -- are you representing\n0128:10 20 Q. And is it not also true that the people who 0120:36 20 her name is circled?\n0128:13 21 are circled are famous people? 01:30:38 21 Q. Her name is circled on the book. In fact, we\n01:28:15 22 A. I'd have to refresh my recollection as to 01:30:40 22 can show it --\n01:28:22 23 exactly who was circled, but I know that some famous 01:30:40 23 A. Okay. Yeah.\n01,28:25 24 people were circled and some famous people were not 01204024 Q. It is circled on the book.\n01:28:29 25 circled. 01:30:42 25 A. Okay. Sure. Yeah, I mean, my -- my\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n19 of 46 sheets Page 224 to 227 of 335 10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n228 230\n0120:44 1 understanding would be that if her -- and this is -- 01:3822 1 all.\n01:30:46 2 could I ask a question about the circling -- or your 01:38:23 2 Q. Take as long as you want to look at the\n01:3049 3 representation? 01:3826 3 document.\n01:30:50 4 Is the circling the same type of circling 01:3827 4 A. Super. Thank you.\n01:30:52 5 that is done for Mr. Dershowitz, for example? Is it the 01:38:51 5 Okay. Yeah. I think I'm -- I'm oriented\n01:30,56 6 same, you know, handwriting, same ink, same -- same 01:3654 6 now. But I haven't looked at the Love entry.\n01:30:59 7 appearance? You know, if it's consistent with the 0128:54 7 Q. My -- my first --\n01:31:02 8 circling -- are you representing it's consistent with 01:38:57 8 A. I want to look at the Love --\n01:31:04 9 the circling? 01:38:57 9 Q. -- question is: Is this a copy of the\n01:31:07 10 Q.

Yes.\n01:31:14 12 the document, I don't see any difference among the 01:3005 12 Q. Okay. And if you would take a look at the --\n01:31:17 13 circles. Are you aware of any document -- 0129:08 13 I've marked the entries for Courtney Love. Take a look\n01:31:20 14 MR.

So am I right -- I'm right, am I not, that\n01:36:49 2 ask that Doc -- Mr. Cassell to take a look at 01:39:50 2 among the others circled are: Courtney Love, Donald\n01:36:51 3 this, and I'm going to ask him about certain of 01:39:54 3 Trump, and Alan Dershowitz, correct?\n01:36:55 4 the entries. 01:39:55 4 A. Correct, among the others, yes.\n01:37:03 5 (Cassell's I.D. Exhibit No. 5 - copy of 01:39:57 5 Q.

It's kind of a -- a box is what I\n01,37:03 8 flags on here -- 01:40:04 8 would say. Some, yes.\n01:37:03 9 THE WITNESS: Sure. 01:4006 9 Q. Is there anything on the face of that\n01:37:06 10 MR. SIMPSON: -- to direct your attention -- 01,40,08 10 document that leads you to conclude that the circling --\n01,37:06 11 THE WITNESS: Correct, yeah. 01:40:13 11 the significance of the circling is any different for\n01:37:09 12 MR. SIMPSON: -- which we can -- I'll note 01:40,16 12 one person than another?\n01:3710 13 the pages for the record just so we have them. 01:40:17 13 A. No.\n01:3716 14 38, 76, and 85. 01:4018 14 Q. So based on the document, do you infer that\n01:37:24 15 THE WITNESS: Okay. I just -- I just want to 01:4023 15 Courtney Love was involved in some kind of sexual abuse\n01:37:25 16 take two minutes or so -- 01,4020 16 of minors?\n01:37:25 17 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:4030 17 A. I would infer that if I were running a\n01:37:27 18 Q. Yeah. Take -- take a moment to look at it. 01:4025 18 criminal investigation through the FBI and I'm trying to\n01,37:29 19 A. Okay. I want to make a few notes, if that's 01:4037 19 find people who would have relevant information, she\n01:38,07 20 all right, just to get them in -- 01:40:40 20 would be one of the people I'd want to talk to.

I'm just going to 01:4045 22 the identified traffickers, Epstein is circled, the\n01.3811 23 make notes to refresh my recollection so we don't have 01:40-.48 23 pilot -- one of the pilots is circled. So it's these\n0138:13 24 to take time. I'm just -- I'm just making notes of the 01:4051 24 people that all seemed to be connected are -- are all\n0138,15 25 context here.

SIMPSON:\n01:41.00 2 of the -- of the names ball-parking in the dark. 01:43:17 2 Q. But based on your testimony previously, you\n01A1:03 3 Q. Do you know whether this address book was 01:43:20 3 would consider all of those facts to be evidence that he\n01:4t07 4 Jeffrey Epstein's address book or Glenn Maxwell's 01:43:26 4 may have been?\n01:41:11 5 address book? 0143:28 5 A. They are, you know, certainly things that I\n01:41:12 6 A. I'm not certain exactly whose book it is. I 01:43:31 6 would want to follow up on.\n01:41:16 7 actually thought it was Alfredo Rodriguez maintaining a 01:43:32 7 Q. And --\n01:41:19 8 copy of records in case he was worried that Epstein 01:43:34 8 A. If I were running an -- we were in the\n01:41:22 9 might try to have him killed at some point, and so this 01:43:36 9 context, I take it, of your question, you know, if\n01:41.25 10 was his insurance policy, I think he said, against that 01;4138 10 somebody is running an investigation into the\n01:41:28 11 happening. 01:43:42 11 organization, so...\n01:41:29 12 MR. SIMPSON: Object to the nonresponsive 01,43:43 12 Q. Did you, in the course of your representation\n01:41:31 13 portion of the answer. 01:43:47 13 of Miss Roberts or any of the other Jane Doe clients you\n01:41:31 14 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:43:56 14 have had who have had claims against Mr. Epstein, make\n01:41:32 15 Q. Is the answer to my question: You don't know 01:43-58 15 any effort to find out whether Mr. Trump had abused any\n01:41:34 16 whether it was Jeffrey Epstein's or Glenn Maxwell's 01A4:02 16 of them?\n01:41:38 17 address book? 01:44:04 17 MR. EDWARDS: I would just object to this\n01:41-39 18 A. i don't know. And the reason I don't know 01:44:09 18 being work-product privilege as it relates to\n01:41-41 19 that is because I actually believe it is neither -- 01:44.1019 other cases that I'm working on with Paul that\n01:41:44 20 neither of their -- that's -- is it one or the other? 01:44,1220 Jack is not involved in.\n01:41:46 21 Actually, I think it's a third possibility. I think 01:44:12 21 MR. SIMPSON: Okay.\n01:41:48 22 this was Alfredo Rodriguez's insurance policy against 01:44:15 22 MR. EDWARDS: With respect to what we did\n01:41:51 23 getting knocked off by Jeffrey Epstein. 01A4:16 23 during our investigation on behalf of other\n01:41:55 24 Q. So that's the view you have of the 01:4418 24 clients.\n01:42:04 25 significance of this document? 01:44:19 25 MR.

And I object on that\n01:421/8 2 reasons it's significant, as we have been talking about, 01:44:20 2 to the extent that it reveals anything you did on\n01:42:10 3 names are circled who appear to have relevant 01:44:23 3 behalf of Virginia Roberts.\n01:42:13 4 information on Jeffrey Epstein's criminal activities. 01:44:23 4 MR. EDWARDS: I don't think Jack would know\n01:42:17 5 Q. Donald Trump was a friend of Jeffrey Epstein; 01.44:26 5 to object to this, but because I know of another\n01:42:22 6 is that not correct? 0144'28 6 case that we work on, that's protected by our\n01:42:23 7 A. I really don't -- my understanding is, yes, 01:44:30 7 work-product privilege, who I talked to and who I\n01:42:26 8 but I -- I don't have a lot of information about Trump. 01:44:32 8 did not.\n01:42:29 9 Q. Its true also, is it not, that Mr. Trump was 0144:32 9 THE WITNESS: I'd like to --\n01:42:34 10 a frequent visitor to Mr. Epstein's residence? 01:44:32 10 MR. SCAROLA: In that case, I instruct you\n01:42:38 11 A. 1-- I know that he visited frequent. I -- I 01:44'34 11 not to answer.\n01:42'41 12 don't have a lot of information about Trump. 01:44.34 12 THE WITNESS: All right.\n01:42:43 13 Q. And his name is circled in this book; is it 01•44.37 13 MR. SIMPSON: All right. You're here,\n01:42:47 14 not? 01.44.39 14 Mr. Edwards, as a client, not an attorney,\n01-42:47 15 A. I believe it is. 01-44:41 15 correct?\n01:42:48 16 Q. Based on him -- assuming he's a frequent 01:44:42 16 MR. EDWARDS: Yes. That's my primary role in\n01:42:5217 visitor to Mr. Epstein's home, and that he's a friend of 01:44:44 17 being here, but I'm going to protect the\n01:43:00 18 Mr. Epstein's, and that his name is circled in this 01:44:46 18 privilege to the extent that it's not being\n01.43:03 19 book, do you infer that he was engaged in criminal 01144:47 19 protected by others who don't recognize that the\n01:43:09 20 sexual abuse of minors? 01:44:50 20 privilege needs to be protected on other matters.\n01:43:11 21 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to the 01:44:52 21 MR. SIMPSON: Okay.\n01,43.13 22 extent that your answer would reveal anything 01:44:53 22 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:4316 23 that my client has told you. 01A4:58 23 Q.

You indicated yesterday that part of the 01:48:09 15 that consistent with your understanding?\n01:45:40 16 basis for your conclusion that this pleading -- it was 01:48:10 16 A. Approximately, yes.\n01:45:44 17 appropriate to file this pleading accusing Professor 01:48:12 17 Q. -- how many times did Professor Dershowitz\n01:45:49 18 Dershowitz of misconduct was that he was a guest at the 01:48:14 18 visit the Palm Beach mansion during that period?\n01:45:53 19 Palm Beach house, correct? 01A8:17 19 A.

Three to five times a year, staying two to\n01:45:57 21 frequent guest, a frequent overnight guest. 01:48:25 21 three nights at a time.\n01:46:01 22 Q.

Yeah, right.\n01:46:35 8 A. It would depend on the circumstances. I 01:48:53 8 Q. -- on the case.\n01A637 9 mean, you know, so -- you know, it would depend on the 01:48:53 9 A. I appreciate that.\n01:46:40 10 circumstances. 01:4654 10 Q. I just want to say, you've testified that you\n01:46A0 11 MR. SCAROLA: Are you representing that 01:48:57 11 understood as of December 30th, 2014, that Professor\n01A6A1 12 Jeffrey Epstein was there at the time? 01.49:0312 Dershowitz had -- was a visitor at the Palm Beach\n01A6:42 13 MR.

So, in your view, you can -- let me -- let me 01:49:21 17 A. Right. I mean, I will take about a minute\n0146:50 18 rephrase that. 01:49:23 18 here because there are a few things I want --\n01.46:52 19 You say it would depend on the 01:492519 Q. Okay.

I'm not asking you about any of your\n01:46:55 23 A. Yes. 01:49:30 23 inferences about anything else. Just, what's the basis\n01:46:56 24 Q. Okay. So that you don't find it incongruous 01:49:34 24 for your belief that he visited three to five times\n01:47:00 25 that someone who knows that a particular home is the 01:4918 25 during that two-year period?\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM Page 236 to 239 of 335 22 of 46 sheets\n240 242\n01:49:39 1 MR. SCAROLA: Could I ask for a 01:51:23 1 context, in other words, information that was\n01:49:40 2 clarification? Are you looking only for direct 01:51:25 2 going to be disclosed, not for advice, but\n01:49:42 3 evidence and you want to exclude the 01:5126 3 factual information that she intended to\n01:49:44 4 circumstantial evidence? Is that the way you 01751:28 4 disclose, that's no -- that's not privileged.\n01A9A6 5 want to -- 01:51:30 5 But if it's something that she communicated to\n01:49:46 6 MR. SIMPSON: I'm asking. You can object to 01:51:32 6 you in confidence with respect to getting legal\n01:49:48 7 the form. 01:51:36 7 advice, then that would be privileged.\n01:49:48 8 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01,51:39 8 THE WITNESS: Right. Okay. So Juan Alessi's\n01:49:48 9 Q. My question is: What was -- what were you -- 01:51:45 9 deposition, Alfredo Rodriguez's deposition, and\n01:49:51 10 what did you have in mind as supporting your conclusion 01:51A9 10 then considerable circumstantial evidence which\n01A9:57 11 or belief that he -- that Professor Dershowitz visited 01:51:52 11 we don't have to rehash here involving the close\n01:50:02 12 three to five times during that relevant period? 01:51:55 12 personal association between Epstein and\n01:50:04 13 MS. McCAWLEY: And I'm sorry. Can I just 01:52:00 13 Dershowitz.\n01:50:06 14 place an objection on the record. I'm going to 01:52:00 14 I mean, again, we can rehash all of that, but\n01:50:07 15 object to the extent that -- so that you do not 01;52:03 15 those were -- those are -- that's kind of a\n01:5010 16 reveal attorney/client privileged communication, 01:52:04 16 quick -- because I know you want to get to a lot\n01:50:12 17 unless it's something that's already public that 01:52:06 17 of questions -- that's a quick sort of highlight\n01:50:15 18 she's revealed. 01:52:09 18 film, if you will.\n01:50:15 19 THE WITNESS: Okay. Right. So I'm going to 01:5209 19 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n01:50:17 20 just exclude -- I take it your question isn't 01:5211 20 Q. Mr. Cassell, isn't it true that Mr. Rodriguez\n01:5019 21 asking about any communications. 01:52:14 21 was not hired until several years after the Summer --\n01:50:19 22 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:52:19 22 A. 2004.\n01:50:22 23 Q. My question is asking about that, but I 01:52:20 23 Q. Let me ask it again.\n01:50:24 24 understand you're going to refuse to provide it. 01:5221 24 -- until well after 2002?\n01:50:25 25 MS. McCAWLEY: Unless it's already public. 01:52:22 25 A. Yeah, about 2004.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n241 243\n01:50:28 1 THE WITNESS: Okay. So as of December 30th, 01:5223 1 Q. And Mr. Rodriguez would have no personal\n01:50:30 2 I'm going to exclude any communications from 01:5228 2 knowledge of how often Professor Dershowitz visited\n01:50:33 3 Virginia Roberts from -- 01,52:31 3 during a period two years or three years before he was\n01:50:34 4 MR. SCAROLA: Except to extent that they have 01:52:34 4 hired; isn't that true?\n01:50:37 5 already been made public. That is, if she has 01:52:35 5 A. So, look, this is -- this is why I was trying\n0150:39 6 given express permission to make disclosures, 01,52:37 6 to speed up the answer to the question. We have a sex\n01:50:43 7 these were not confidential communications, but 01:52:41 7 trafficking organization that is running a common scheme\n0150:46 8 communications intended to be communicated to 01:52:43 8 and plan that is continuing on until it was interrupted\n01:50:48 9 third parties, then you are permitted to include 01:52:45 9 by law enforcement about 2005 and 2006.\n01:50:52 10 information from Virginia Roberts in your 01:52:49 10 So what the -- the criminal organization is\n01150:54 11 response to that extent. And I -- go ahead. 01:52:51 11 doing in 2004, unless I have some significant evidence\n01:51M 12 THE WITNESS: Okay. 01:52:54 12 that it's different than what was going on in 2002,\n01:51:00 13 BY MR. SIMPSON: 01:52:58 13 2001, 2000, 1999, I think it's reasonable to conclude\n01:51:00 14 Q. As of December -- 01:53:01 14 that the same sort of criminal activities are going on\n01:5101 15 A. Right. 01.53:03 15 later.\n01:51:03 16 Q. -- 30th, 2014 -- 0153:04 16 So if -- if you want -- if you want me to get\n01:51:06 17 A. Right. 01,53:07 17 into the -- the full scope of the criminal organization,\n01.51:06 18 Q. -- correct? So -- 01:53:09 18 we can get into it. But the fact that somebody in 2004\n01:51:06 19 A. Yeah, that's right. 01:5313 19 sees this going on, leads me to conclude that it's\n01:51:07 20 Q. -- any -- any public statements by her after 01'53:16 20 probably the same thing going on in the absence of other\n01,51:10 21 December 30th, 2014 would not be included in the answer. 01:53:19 21 information in 2001.\n01:51:14 22 A. Okay. 01:53:21 22 Q. So from Mr. Rodriguez's testimony about what\n01:51:14 23 MS. McCAWLEY: But let me be clear. Let me 01:53:28 23 was going on, so to speak -- and my question related,\n01:51:16 24 be clear about my objection.

Right. 01:55:20 1 MR. SIMPSON: Really, objecting to the form\n01:53:37 2 Q. That because he visited, according to 01:55:23 2 of the question preserves all of any problems\n0163:40 3 Mr. Rodriguez, several times a year in 2004, 2005, he 01:55:26 3 there may be with the question.\n01:53:45 4 must have visited several times a year in 2000 -- 19- -- 01:55.27 4 MR.

SIMPSON:\n01:53:59 8 then, in the absence of, you know, some falling out 01:55:32 8 Q. Mr. Cassell, is it your testimony that, from\n016462 9 between people or somebody becoming, you know, more 01:5517 9 Mr. Rodriguez's testimony about how often he says\n0164:05 10 associated or less associated with a criminal 01:55:43 10 Professor Dershowitz visited in a 2004/2005 time frame,\n01:54:07 11 organization. I mean, if you want to get into the 01:55:49 11 its fair to draw an inference about how often he\n01.54:09 12 circumstantial evidence, in 2003, there's an article on 01:55:52 12 visited in an earlier -- three-year earlier time frame?\n01:5413 13 which, you know, Dershowitz identifies himself -- 01:55:56 13 A. In the circumstances of this case,\n01:54:15 14 Q. Let me interrupt you because I'm asking -- 01:5659 14 absolutely.\n01:54:15 15 A. Okay. 01:55:59 15 Q. And would it be fair to infer from the number\n0164:18 16 Q. -- about -- my only question is evidence of 01666316 of times that Donald Trump visited three years later,\n0164:18 17 how -- not anything, whether engaged in conduct or 01:5608 17 how often he visited at an earlier period?\n01:54:23 18 didn't engage in conduct, just how many times he came 01:56:09 18 A. I did not investigate the circumstances\n01:54:26 19 during this period. 01:56:12 19 involving Trump. He wasn't somebody that was coming up.\n01:54:26 20 A. Right. 0166.16 20 Q. Were you aware on December 30th of 2014 that\n01:5426 21 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me, counsel. That's the 01:5625 21 Donald Trump was quoted in Vanity Fair as saying: \"I've\n01:54:28 22 reason why I asked you to clarify whether you 01:5628 22 known Jeff\" -- referring to Epstein -- oh, I'm sorry.\n5164:30 23 want to limit this to direct evidence or whether 01:56:34 23 It was a New Yorker Magazine, not Vanity Fair. That he\n01:54:33 24 you want all of the evidence including 01:56:37 24 was quoted as saying: \"I've known Jeff.' -- referring to\n01:54:35 25 circumstantial evidence, because as we both know,\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n0166:40 25 Epstein -- \"for 15 years.

SIMPSON: We really don't need a speech. 016662 3 the younger side. No doubt about it, Jeffrey enjoys the\n01:54:47 4 MR. SCAROLA: -- a well-connected -- 01:56:56 4 social -- social life\"? Were you aware of that on\n01:54,17 5 MR. SIMPSON: We really don't -- 01:58:57 5 December 30th, 2014?\n5164:48 6 MR. SCAROLA: -- chain of circumstance may be 01:5668 6 A. Possibly. I mean that sounds vaguely\n01:54:49 7 as compelling proof as direct evidence of a given 01:57:01 7 familiar. Trump has just not been somebody that -- that\n01:5463 8 fact. That's the law. 01:57:05 8 I've paid much attention to in this case.\n01:54:55 9 If you don't want -- 01:57:07 9 Q. Based on that statement, and the facts we\n01:54:57 10 MR. SIMPSON: Really, sir. 01:57.14 10 discussed earlier about Mr. Trump visiting and being a\n01:54:55 11 MR.

I'm asking you -- you're 01:57:35 18 information, I'm not -- I'm not suspicious, no,\n016606 19 asking ambiguous questions. 0167:39 19 not given the information I have.\n016608 20 MR.

So notwithstanding that his name is\n0165:10 22 evidence, we will give you only direct evidence. 01:57:42 22 circled in the address book, he was a good friend, he\n01:55:13 23 If you want a full and complete answer, it's 01:57:49 23 visited often, and he was quoted as saying that Jeff was\n01:55:15 24 got to include circumstantial evidence, so don't 0167:54 24 a terrific guy who liked young women almost as much as\n016619 25 cut him off when he's giving you that. 01:57:58 25 Trump did, you're not even suspicious?\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM Page 244 to 247 of 335 24 of 46 sheets\n248 250\n016801 1 A.

What\n01:58:06 3 The fact that his name is circled, if I were 02:0016 3 is your best estimate of how much money you have made\n016808 4 running an FBI investigation, I'd go send somebody to 02:0021 4 representing victims of Jeffrey Epstein?\n01:58:10 5 see what he knew about it, but no, it would take a lot 02:0024 5 A.

I need to confer with .-\n01:5821 9 the fact that a person often visited the mansion, the 020013 9 MS. McCAWLEY: Yeah. I'm going to object.\n01:5824 10 person -- the fact that a person was a friend of 02001310 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n0168:27 11 Mr. Epstein for 15 years, the fact that the person had 02:00:34 11 Q. And that -- that's a fact -- that's not a\n016812 12 stated publicly that: \"Mr. Epstein liked young women 02:0036 12 privileged question. That's a factual question.\n01:5816 13 almost as much as I do myself,\" and the fact that the 02:00:37 13 A. Factual. Well, there are -- there are --\n01:58:40 14 name is circled in the address book is not sufficient to 0200:38 14 Q. Just how much money?

I need to --\n0168.47 17 A. So... 02:0046 17 MR. SIMPSON: There's a question pending. I\n01:5048 18 Q. Yes or no. It's a yes or no question. 02:00:47 18 object to a break.

My question is\n01;58:57 24 \"suspicion.\" I'm not particularly suspicious on 020053 24 how much money, and that's privileged?\n01:58:59 25 those facts, but it -- you know, what do you mean 02:00:5525 MR.

SIMPSON: 0122:42 1 A. Yeah. That hasn't been something that I have\n02:20:38 2 Q. I'm -- I'm trying to close a loop here. 02:22:44 2 focused on, no. I mean...\n02:20:40 3 A. Yeah. 02:22:46 3 Q. It is -- it is correct, is it not, that you\n02:20:40 4 Q. I'm asking whether you were involved in any 02:22:49 4 anticipate that if you are successful in setting aside\n02:2044 5 other cases in which claims have been made against 02:22:53 5 the nonprosecution agreement, that the names of\n02:20:47 6 Jeffrey Epstein for damages that are still active; they 02:22:58 6 additional victims will become known; didn't you testify\n02:20:52 7 have not been resolved? 02:23:01 7 to that yesterday?\n02:20:53 8 A. So we are talking civil cases, unresolved 0123:03 8 A. I -- I'm not -- I must be confused here. I\n02:20:58 9 civil cases against Jeffrey Epstein right now? 02:23,07 9 don't remember.\n0/2059 10 Q. Unresolved cases seeking money from Jeffrey 02:2357 10 Q. Well, wait -- I don't want to -- you know,\n02:21:02 11 Epstein. 022309 11 let me ask the question --\n022152 12 MR. SCAROLA: And to the extent that that 02:23:09 12 A. Yeah.\n022153 13 question calls for matters that are of public 0223:10 13 Q. -- rather than my recollection.\n02:21:06 14 record, then, obviously, you can respond. 0223:11 14 A. Yeah, yeah. That's what I'm not...\n02:21:08 15 THE WITNESS: Right. Yeah. None. 022312 15 Q. My question is: Do you anticipate that if\n02:21:09 16 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:23:15 16 you're successful in setting aside the nonprosecution\n02:21:10 17 Q. Are there -- and I'm not asking for the name. 0223:18 17 agreement, that the names of additional victims will\n02:21:11 18 Are there any not of public record that -- 02:232318 become known?\n0121:15 19 A. What would be a \"not\"? 02:23:24 19 A. Additional Epstein victims at this point?\n0221716 20 Q. Well, if you had made a claim that's not in 0123:26 20 Q. Yes.\n02:21:19 21 suit, for example. 02:23:26 21 A. Again, it's pretty speculative. The\n02:21:20 22 A. Oh, against Jeffrey Epstein? 02:23:30 22 the issue -- you know, the case, you know, the events\n02:21:21 23 Q. Yes. 02:23:34 23 were roughly a decade ago. I mean, we are always hoping\n02:21:21 24 A. Yeah. No, I don't -- I don't think there's 0223:38 24 that there might be somebody additional that would come\n02:21:25 25 anything. Yeah, no -- no claims against Epstein, right. 02:23:40 25 forward, but that hasn't been the focus of the\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n257 259\n02:21:30 1 Q. And -- and it's true, is it not, that if 02:23:43 1 litigation.\n02:21:33 2 you're successful in the CVRA case, in setting aside the 02:23:43 2 Q. Whether --\n02:21:37 3 nonprosecution agreement, you expect to get other 02:23:45 3 A. And you always hope that there are -- yeah, I\n02:21:41 4 clients who will have claims against Jeffrey Epstein? 0/23:48 4 mean, any time you file a case, ah, I hope some more,\n0121:45 5 A. If we -- in civil claims? 02:23:50 5 you know, witnesses will come forward to support that\n0/21:47 6 Q. Claims for damages, claims for money from 0223:52 6 case, but that hasn't been the focus, trying to secure\n02:21:50 7 Jeffrey Epstein. 022355 7 additional -- additional witnesses. That is a\n012151 8 A. That -- I mean, that starts to -- if the 02:23:57 8 possibility, though. I mean, I think in fairness to\n02:21:55 9 nonprosecution agreement is set aside? 02:24:00 9 your question, that is a possibility that, you know,\n02:2158 10 Q. Yes, if you're successful. 0224:02 10 if -- if the case attracts attention and -- and\n02:2159 11 A. I haven't really -- that sounds pretty 02:24:05 11 somebody, you know, says, you know, gosh, now that I --\n0322:02 12 speculative. I haven't really thought about the 02:24:0912 I -- I -- you know, I moved away to escape Epstein and\n02:22:04 13 civil -- the focus of the CVRA case is criminal. I 0224,1013 now it's safe for me to come back, or -- or now I\n02:2258 14 haven't thought about, you know, whether, civil claims 02:24:13 14 realize I have a claim, that's always a possibility.\n02:22:11 15 could somehow arise out of that. I mean, we are talking 02:24:15 15 I certainly wouldn't want to suggest that,\n02:2214 16 about, you know, events that took place long ago. There 0224:17 16 you know, we are ruling that possibility out.\n02:2118 17 would be statute of limitations issues, you know. 02:24:19 17 Q. And for the same reason that additional\n02:22:20 18 Whether they are viable civil claims at this point has 0224:23 18 witnesses might become available -- known, additional\n02:22:24 19 not been something that I have, you know, given much 02:24:27 19 clients might become known, correct?\n02:22:25 20 thought to. 022428 20 A. That is a theoretical possibility, yes.\n0122:26 21 Q. So is it your testimony then that you have 02:2430 21 Q. In these four cases that you mentioned, the\n02:22:28 22 not thought about the question of whether success in the 02:24:34 22 three that were, which you were counsel of record and\n02:22:33 23 CVRA case may or result in you obtaining additional 02:24:38 23 one in which you were not, did you meet at any time in\n02:22:39 24 clients with claims for money damages against Jeffrey 0124744 24 person with the clients? And if it's different as to\n02:22:41 25 Epstein? 012448 25 some than others, tell me that, but --\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n27 of 46 sheets Page 256 to 259 of 335 10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n260 262\n02:24:50 1 A. Yes. 02:27:10 1 filing on December 30th of 2014, was the first time that\n02:24:50 2 Q. In all four, you met with the clients? 02:27:16 2 you had ever, yes, ever on behalf of Virginia Roberts or\n02:24:52 3 A. In three of the four. 02:27:21 3 any other client, accused Professor Dershowitz or\n02:24:53 4 Q. And were those three the three in which you 02:2725 4 Prince Andrew of sexual abuse in a public filing?\n02:24:57 5 were counsel of record? 02:27:29 5 A. If you're talking about direct allegation,\n02:24:58 6 A. Yes. 02:27:31 6 that's correct.\n02:24:59 7 Q. As of December -- 02:27'31 7 Q. Had you ever public -- well, at no other time\n02:25:01 8 A. I believe I was counsel of record on all 022239 8 that -- you expected when you filed the pleading on\n02:25:03 9 three of those. I would have to double-check. I know I 02:27:41 9 December 30th, 2014, that it would be -- be something of\n02:25:05 10 was counsel of record in the federal case. The two of 02:27:45 10 public record that would generate publicity, correct?\n0225:08 11 them are state cases, I believe, that it was pro hac in 02:27:48 11 A. Public record, the focus was not generating\n02:25:11 12 the state cases. 02:27:51 12 publicity. Of course, when you file an allegation like\n02:25:14 13 Q. Okay. I wont ask you the names, but in the 02:27:54 13 that, there certainly would have been -- we would\n0225:14 14 four cases, what are the initials of your clients? 02:27:55 14 anticipate there would have been publicity, absolutely.\n02:25:19 15 A. Okay. So the -- the -- 0227:58 15 Q. And before December 30th of 2014, to the best\n02:25:20 16 Q. Put it this way: How are they identified in 022803 16 of your knowledge, neither you, nor anyone else, had\n02:25:22 17 the caption that you filed? 02:28:08 17 told Professor Dershowitz that there were allegations\n02:25:23 18 A. Well, also the three that were filed, one 0228:12 18 that he personally had engaged in sexual misconduct?\n02:25:26 19 was -- one was the initials S.R. I referred to 02.28:12 19 A. um...\n02:25:28 20 Miss S.R. yesterday. That was the Jane Doe case in 0228:19 20 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm going to object to that\n02:25:32 21 Federal Court in front of Judge Marra. 02:28:20 21 date if that reveals anything that would be\n0225:34 22 There were two state claims. I'll -- I'll 022821 22 privileged between something that would have been\n02:25:37 23 identify the clients as E.W. and L.M. 0228:24 23 communicated by the client.\n02:25:42 24 Q. And then the fourth one? 0228:25 24 MR. SIMPSON: No. These are communications\n02:25:44 25 A. The fourth one, I believe -- the initial M. 02:28:27 25 to Professor Dershowitz.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n261 263\n02:25:49 1 and I believe the last initial was B., but I may be 02:28:29 1 MR. SCAROLA: Yes. And that could very well\n02:25:54 2 wrong about the B. First initial M. 02:2531 2 include attorney/client privileged\n02:25:56 3 Q. At the -- okay. At the time that you filed 0228:33 3 communications.\n0225:04 4 the joinder motion -- 02:28:36 4 MR. SIMPSON: Let me -- I'll ask my question.\n02:26:05 5 A. Yes. 02:28:37 5 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n0226:06 6 Q. -- in the federal case, so December 30th of 02:28:38 6 Q. My question is: Did you ever advise\n02:26:10 7 2014, you knew that naming Prince Andrew would generate 0228:45 7 Professor Dershowitz that there were allegations that he\n02:26:15 8 substantial publicity, correct? 0228:50 8 had engaged, himself, in sexual misconduct with minors?\n02:26:18 9 A. I knew it would attract a lot of attention. 0228:56 9 A. Not me personally, no.\n02:26:23 10 Yeah, I mean, \"substantial\" we could debate, but, sure, 02:28:57 10 Q. Are you aware of any e-mail, letter, other\n02:26:25 11 I knew that that was going to -- you know, once you 0229:04 11 communication from anybody that went to Professor\n0226:28 12 start exposing the extent of this criminal activity, 02:29:09 12 Dershowitz that told Professor Dershowitz that he had\n0226:33 13 obviously, there were going to be a lot of people 02:29:12 13 been accused of engaging in misconduct himself?\n02:26:36 14 interested, yes. 0229:17 14 A. Well, there -- I mean, I'm aware that there\n0226:36 15 Q. And you also knew that naming Professor 0229719 15 was a deposition request in 2009. There was a\n0225:41 16 Dershowitz would attract publicity? 0229:22 16 deposition request in 2011. That was accompanied by an\n02:26:46 17 A. Well, when you say \"naming,\" one of the 022527 17 exchange of correspondence that said, for example,\n0225:49 18 things you've got to understand is the names were 02:29:29 18 numerous witnesses have placed you in the presence of\n0226:50 19 already in the case, both Prince Andrew and Alan 02:29:31 19 Jeffrey Epstein and underaged girls. It didn't then go\n0225:56 20 Dershowitz. We had pending discovery requests for 02:29:35 20 on to say, and you were committing sexual abuse of them,\n0226:59 21 information about both of them. So when you say \"naming 0229:38 21 but it said numerous witnesses had -- had done that.\n02:27:00 22 them,\" you know, they were already named in the case. 02:2942 22 And I think a reasonable inference would be\n02:27:02 23 Now, would the additional allegations have 02:29:43 23 that, you know, you're verily sure that a witness and\n02:2705 24 attracted additional attention? Sure. 02:29:47 24 then that also raises the possibility of -- well, I\n02:27:07 25 Q. Mr. Cassell, it's true, is it not, that the\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n02:2049 25 mean, I think Professor Dershowitz mentioned yesterday,\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM Page 260 to 263 of 335 28 of 46 sheets\n264 266\n022961 1 that if you're in the presence of a convicted sex 023203 1 MR. SIMPSON: I'm sorry. You were right,\n02:2964 2 offender, or a sex offender and sex abuse is going on, 02:3208 2 yes.\n0229:57 3 you would have obligations, for example, at a minimum to 02:32:08 3 MR. SCAROLA: Can you just show it to him?\n02:30:00 4 report that, and it raises the possibility of other 02:3209 4 MR. SIMPSON: I'll read it, and then if he\n02:3002 5 criminal activity as well. 023211 5 wants to look at it, that will be fine.\n023004 6 Q. Is it your testimony, Mr. Cassell, that 02:32:12 6 MR. SCAROLA: Thank you.\n0230:07 7 telling a person that multiple people have identified 02:32:73 7 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n02:30:15 8 you as a witness to some activity is fair notice that 02:32:14 8 Q. This is a letter from Mr. Scarola to\n02:30:20 9 you, yourself, are accused of engaging in criminal 02:3215 9 Mr. Dershowitz dated August 23rd, 2011. The second\n02:30:26 10 misconduct? 0232:23 10 sentence says -- well, I'm going to read the whole\n02:30:26 11 A. So -- so you, I think, recharacterized the 02:32:26 11 thing.\n0230:29 12 letter that went to Mr. Dershowitz in 2011. The letter, 02:32:26 12 MR. SCAROLA: Yeah, thank you.\n02:30:32 13 as I recall, doesn't say he is a witness. It says, if I 13 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n02:30:3514 recall -- we can double-check the language -- but I 14 Q. \"We do not\" --\n023038 15 believe the language says: Numerous witnesses have 15 MR. SCAROLA: It's short, so it would be\n0230:42 16 placed you in the presence of Jeffrey Epstein, underaged 16 helpful if you just read the whole thing.\n02:30:45 17 girls, and Epstein. Then, you know, so at that point, 17 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n02:30:48 18 given what we know in this case, given that at that 18 Q. Yeah.\n02:30:52 19 point in 2011, there had been an ongoing set of 02:32:28 19 \"We do not intend to inquire about any\n02:3065 20 allegations against Mr. Epstein, I -- I think your 02:32:31 20 privileged communications or attorney work\n02:30:59 21 question doesn't -- doesn't take into account this 02:32:33 21 product. We do, however, have reason to believe\n02:3103 22 surrounding context. 02:32:37 22 that you have personally observed Jeffrey Epstein\n02:31:04 23 Not to mention the fact there had been a 2009 0232:41 23 in the presence of underaged females, and we\n02:31:07 24 deposition request and a 2013 document request. 02:32:44 24 would like the opportunity to question you under\n02:31:12 25 Q.

That sounds about right, yeah. 02:35:45 6 that puts you on notice that you're in -- in --\n02:34:03 7 Q. So Mr. Dershowitz did not ignore the letter; 02:35:49 7 in jeopardy of -- of criminal activity,\n02:34:04 8 he responded to it, correct? 02:3552 8 particularly when you combine that with the fact\n02:34:06 9 A. i think that's right. 02:35,54 9 that there is a duty to report child abuse in\n02:34:07 10 Q. And go back to the first letter. 02,35:57 10 many states in this country, including the State\n02:34:10 11 A.

Well, it puts you on notice that you're a 02:36:22 21 Mr. Scarola simply says, you were -- you were personally\n02:34:49 22 potential, obviously, witness to this and then therefore 02:36:28 22 -- you personally observed Jeffrey Epstein in the\n02:34:51 23 you could have potential involvement. 02:36:31 23 presence of underaged females, correct?\n02:34,53 24 Let me give you a simple illustration. It'll 02:36:33 24 A. Correct.\n0234,55 25 take about 20 seconds. If somebody says -- 02:36:33 25 Q. It does not say, you witnessed abuse of any\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n269 271\n02:34:56 1 Q. Well, let me back up. My first question, 02:36:37 1 minor; we have reason to believe you observed abuse of\n02,34:57 2 though, if you can answer the question. o2:36:39 2 minors?\n02:3418 3 MR. SCAROLA: No. I'm sorry. The witness is 02,38:39 3 A. If those words do not appear there, but come\n02:35:00 4 entitled to complete his response. If you 02:36,41 4 on, we -- we know -- we know in the context of this\n02:35:01 5 don't -- if you believe it to be unresponsive, 02:36:44 5 case, when somebody is asking to take a deposition about\n02:35:03 6 you can move to strike it, but he's entitled to 02:36:47 6 your observation of young girls, they weren't talking\n02:35:06 7 complete it. 02:36:50 7 about preparations for birthday parties. They were\n02:35:06 8 MR. SIMPSON: He -- 02:36:52 8 talking about sexual abuse of children.\n0/35:06 9 MR. SCAROLA: So go ahead and complete your 02:36,56 9 And that was what Mr. Dershowitz was going to\n02:35:08 10 response. 02:36:59 10 be asked about. And he did not -- he did not take that\n02:35:08 11 MR. SIMPSON: Can we have a -- you can give 02:37:02 11 opportunity to try to clear the record; instead, we are,\n02:35,09 12 an explanation, but a yes or no with an 02:37:05 12 you know, here today, because among other reasons, he\n02:35:10 13 explanation. 02:37:09 13 he -- he wasn't deposed then.\n02:35:11 14 MR. SCAROLA: You already got that. Could we 02:37:7214 Q. I want -- I want to comment. I'm just a\n02:35:12 15 now have the completion of the response? 02,37:18 15 little bit non -- nonplussed, so I want to come back to\n0235:14 16 THE WITNESS: Here's the simple illustration 02:37:21 16 this again.\n02:35,16 17 I think makes it pretty clear: If somebody says, 02:37:27 17 A. Well, I'm -- I have to tell you, I'm a little\n02:35:17 18 we have observed you in the presence of a kilo of 02:37:23 18 bit nonplussed that somebody would say that letter\n02:35:20 19 cocaine, we would like to question you about the 02:37:24 19 doesn't put you on notice that you're potentially\n0235:23 20 presence -- about your observations of this, that 02:37:27 20 involved in criminal activity. I mean, come on.\n02:3516 21 doesn't directly state that you are a drug user 02:37:30 21 Q. I -- my question wasn't potentially involved\n02:35:27 22 or a drug dealer, but it certainly puts you on 02:37:33 22 in criminal activity. We disagree about whether it does\n02:35:29 23 notice that you're associated with that criminal 02:37:36 23 that.\n02:35:37 24 activity and somebody is going to question you 02:37:37 24 A. Okay. I think it does.\n02:35:31 25 about it. 02:37:38 25 Q. I suspect you -- that's how you read it?\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM Page 268 to 271 of 335 30 of 46 sheets\n272 274\n02:37A0 1 A. I think it puts you on notice in the context 02:4603 1 his criminal associates were doing. And he thought that\n02:37:42 2 of a country which has required people to report the 02:4605 2 Mr. Dershowitz would have information and was trying to\n0237:45 3 sexual abuse of children, and somebody wants to talk to 024067 3 collect that.\n02:37,49 4 you about your observations of a convicted sex offender 02:40:08 4 Now, whether the -- the -- the tentacles of\n02:37:52 5 with underage girls, that that's going to be one of the 024610 5 the organization would extend so that they wrapped\n02:37:56 6 subjects that's going to be discussed, yes. 02:40:13 6 around Mr. Dershowitz himself, I guess was the subject\n02:37:56 7 Q. My question was -- my initial question was: 02:40:16 7 that -- that Mr. Scarola, I am assuming, was hoping to\n02:38:01 8 Does -- do the statements in this letter put the reader 02:40:18 8 explore. But Mr. Dershowitz prevented that opportunity.\n02:38:05 9 on notice that you, personally, are accused of abusing 02:4622 9 Q. And Mr. Dershowitz, you knew, had been\n02:3614 10 minors yourself, not that you have in some knowledge or 02:40:26 10 Mr. Epstein's attorney, correct?\n02:38:19 11 evidence that someone else did it, but that you, 02:40:27 11 A. Correct.\n02:38:22 12 yourself, did it; is that a way to give fair notice? 02:40:28 12 Q. And you knew, just as we have seen here today\n02:38:26 13 A. Well, in fair notice in what context? You 02:4632 13 with multiple assertions of privilege, that he could not\n02:38:30 14 know, is he on notice that a lawsuit is going to be 02:40:36 14 testify about anything he learned as an attorney?\n02:38:31 15 filed the next day? 02:4637 15 A. He could testify, and the letter itself says,\n02:38:32 16 Simply from that piece of -- that letter 02:4640 16 we are not going to ask you about any communications; we\n02:3834 17 alone, they are on notice, you know -- I mean, I think 0240:43 17 are going to ask you about observations of sex abuse by\n02:3837 18 that puts you on notice that there are serious 0240:47 18 a convicted sex offender, and your personal knowledge of\n02:38:41 19 allegations afoot and it would be in your best interest 02:40:55 19 that. That would not have erased in the -- and\n02:38:43 20 if you hadn't done anything, to show up, attend a 02:40:52 20 Mr. Scarola's a very good attorney, and I'm sure all of\n02:38:46 21 deposition, let all the facts come out so that everybody 02:40:55 21 his questions that we saw the last couple of days would\n02:38:48 22 can know them. 02:4658 22 have been very narrowly focused on observations about\n02:38:49 23 Q. Would you agree that accusing someone of 02:41:01 23 what this criminal organization was doing.\n023654 24 themselves abusing a minor is different than accusing 02:41:05 24 Q. And so to the bottom line is that your view,\n023600 25 someone of having knowledge that somebody else did it?\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n02:41:08 25 your sworn testimony, this letter of August 23rd, 2011,\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n273 275\n02:39:03 1 A. Yes. 0241,16 1 put Mr. Dershowitz, Professor Dershowitz, on fair notice\n02:3964 2 Q. And to accuse someone of abusing a minor is a 02:4121 2 that he was being accused of being a sex offender\n02:39:09 3 serious, serious accusation of criminal conduct, 02:4125 3 himself?\n02,3614 4 personal criminal conduct, not just failing to report 02:4126 4 A. We -- we have gone over this. I think it put\n02:39:17 5 somebody else, but you, yourself, are abusing people? 02:41:28 5 him on fair notice that there were serious questions\n02:39:21 6 A. Oh, yeah. 02:41:31 6 being raised about what he knew about this criminal\n02:39:21 7 MR. SCAROLA: Are you suggesting that that's 02:41:35 7 organization, what the potential criminal responsibility\n02:39:23 8 not criminal conduct? 02:41:36 8 he had for failure to report sexual abuse of a child, as\n02:39:25 9 MR. SIMPSON: I'm -- I'm -- my question 02A1:39 9 well as other possibilities.\n0239:26 10 stands. 02:41:42 10 MR. SIMPSON: I'm going to move to strike as\n02:39:26 11 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:41:43 11 nonresponsive.\n0239:26 12 Q. What is the answer to that? 02:41A3 12 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n02:39:27 13 A. It is a very serious charge, I agree. That's 02:41:44 13 Q. My question is a very narrow one, whether\n02:3630 14 why we are all here today. 02:41,47 14 this letter, in your opinion, under oath, fairly put\n02:39:30 15 Q. Okay. And -- and if you wanted to put 02,41:53 15 Mr. -- Professor Dershowitz on notice that he himself\n02:39:32 16 someone on fair notice that they are accused themselves 02:41:58 16 was accused of abusing minors.\n02:39:36 17 of being a sex offender, a criminal who has abused 0242:02 17 A. Again, that's a vague question. I've tried\n02:3641 18 children, wouldn't you tell them that? 02:42:04 18 to give the best answer I can. That was certainly a\n02:3643 19 A. That's a speculative question because that 02:42:06 19 potential area of questioning. I think that puts him on\n02:39:46 20 letter was designed to try to collect information about 02:42:09 20 notice that it would have been in his best interest to\n02:39:48 21 an international sex trafficking organization. And so 0242:12 21 appear to answer those questions.\n02:39:52 22 as to -- you know, I'm not going to speculate as to why 02:42:14 22 MR. SIMPSON: I'm going to object to the\n02:3655 23 Mr. Scarola wrote it that way. But my sense, based on 02:42:16 23 answer again as nonresponsive.\n02:3658 24 the public record is, that he was trying to get as much 02A2:16 24 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n024601 25 information as he could about what Jeffrey Epstein and 02A2.18 25 Q. Its a really simple question.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n31 of 46 sheets Page 272 to 275 of 335 10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n276 278\n02:42:20 1 Does that letter put Mr. Dershowitz on fair 02:44:17 1 having abused minors?

No. I think a yes-or-no answer would be\n02:42:26 3 himself? 02:44:24 3 misleading, given the context of this case.\n02:42:27 4 MR. SCAROLA: Objection. Repetitious. To 02:4427 4 Q. You referred in your earlier testimony to -\n024228 5 the extent that you can improve upon the answer, 02:44A4 5 strike that for a moment.\n02:42:32 6 you can improve upon the answer.

I don't think so.\n02:42:38 10 BY MR. SIMPSON: 02:4513 10 Q. Okay. Are you aware that -- well, perhaps it\n02:42:38 11 Q. Let -- let me ask -- 02:45:17 11 was Miss McCawley who referred to it.\n02:4240 12 A. -- to your question. 0245;19 12 Do you recall there being a reference this\n02:42:40 13 Q. I'll ask you a different question. 02:45:21 13 morning to an article being published about\n02:42:41 14 A.

You did. 02:53:07 15 A. Okay. Which -- yes, I mean, in a general\n02:50:31 16 Q.

Okay. Let me just double-check. 025315 18 Q. Yes. The allegations in your joinder motion\n02:50:41 19 Once the criminal organization had put the 02:53:18 19 that Prince Andrew and Professor Dershowitz had abused\n02:50:45 20 bait out, so to speak, to various people, and they took 02:53:24 20 Virginia Roberts, then known as Jane Doe Number 3,\n0250:49 21 the bait that -- you know, I'm -- I'm speaking 025326 21 generated a firestorm of publicity; did it not?\n0250:49 22 colloquially here. These are -- these are young girls 02:53:30 22 A. It generated a lot of publicity, yes.\n02:50:54 23 who are being sexually abused. Once the criminal 0253:32 23 Q. And within days of that, you were -- you were\n02:50:56 24 organization had gotten people to sexually abuse 02:53:35 24 participating in attempting to arrange an interview with\n0250:58 25 these -- these young girls, at that point, they had 0253:38 25 ABC News; isn't that true?\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n285 287\n02:51:01 I information that they could use to blackmail those 02:53:39 1 A. That -- within days of -- the chronology is\n02:51:02 2 people and -- and then get favors in exchange. 02:53:43 2 important here: The allegations were filed in this\n02:51:05 3 And that's Epstein at the head of the o2:53:45 3 pleading on December 30th. Several days after that,\n0251:08 4 organization would be the one who would benefit most 02:53:48 4 Mr. Dershowitz then took to the airwaves to denounce,\n0251:11 5 directly from the black -- the blackmail information. 02:5353 5 not only Brad and me, but -- but particularly of concern\n02:51:12 6 Q. And by \"blackmail information,\" do you mean 02:5256 6 to me was Virginia Roberts, this victim of sex\nD2:5117 7 that Mr. Epstein then had information that he could 02:5358 7 trafficking.\n02:5119 8 threaten to disclose if the other person didn't do what 02:53:59 8 And, at that point, as one of -- as one of\n02:5124 9 Epstein asked them to do? 0254:01 9 her attorneys, I was looking for a way to respond to\n0251:24 10 A. Precisely. 02:54:05 10 that media assault on her by Mr. Dershowitz.\n0251:26 11 Q. As of December 30th, 2014, if Miss Roberts 02:54,09 11 MR. SIMPSON: Move to strike as\n02:51:32 12 had access to publicity, she had exactly the same 02:54:09 12 nonresponsive.\n02:5135 13 ability to blackmail people; isn't that true? 02:54:09 13 BY MR. SIMPSON:\n0251:38 14 A. Absolutely not. A billionaire has far more 02:5415 14 Q. Did -- within 24 hours of this pleading being\n0251:43 15 resources than a victim of child sex abuse, particularly 02:54:22 15 filed, there was publicity about the allegations against\n02:51746 16 one that has been forced into hiding in Australia to 02:54:27 16 Prince Andrew and Mr. Dershowitz -- Professor\n02:51:49 17 escape the criminal organization. 02:54:31 17 Dershowitz; isn't that correct?\n02:51,51 18 So for you to suggest that Virginia Roberts 02:54,32 18 A. I don't know the exact time frame, but\n02:51,52 19 had the same ability to blackmail somebody as Jeffrey 02,54:34 19 that -- you know, roughly that time frame sounds about\n02:5156 20 Epstein is, I think, preposterous. 02:5426 20 right.\n025200 21 Q. As of -- Miss -- Miss Roberts had the same 02:54:36 21 Q. If Mr. -- if Professor Dershowitz had never\n02:52:03 22 ability as Jeffrey Epstein to reveal publicly the names 0254:39 22 said anything, wouldn't you expect that these\n02:52:12 23 of the people who she says sexually abused her, as did 02:54:42 23 allegations as to Prince Andrew, in particular, and\n02:52:17 24 Mr. Epstein; isn't that true? 02:54:47 24 Professor Dershowitz would get substantial publicity?\n0252:19 25 A.

And one -- one thing that occurred\n02:58:57 13 realize it would happen? 03:0639 13 to me during the break, in the context of this\n02,5868 14 A. Sure. I mean, this was a case that had 03:05:42 14 case, is that there had been allegations that\n026962 15 been already -- this litigation had been going on at 03:05:44 15 Epstein was part of the -- the sex trafficking\n02,59:02 16 that point for seven years and lots of people were 0105:47 16 organization, had video cameras mounted\n02;59:04 17 following it. This is -- this case is one of the most 01064917 throughout many of his -- his mansions.

She had the ability to speak the words, but, 03:06:18 4 would not have had the ability to do.\n02:5642 5 again, I think its preposterous to say that a victim of 03:06:18 5 BY MR.

Mr. Cassell, didn't you testify yesterday\n025948 7 to disclose information. 0106:22 7 that any videotapes from Mr. Epstein's house had been\n02:59:51 8 For example, Virginia Roberts could be 03:0627 8 destroyed?\n02:5962 9 attacked, and I think as we were talking about 0106:28 9 A. I -- when I used the word \"destroyed,\" I\n02:59:54 10 yesterday, we have seen evidence of the kind of attack 03:06:30 10 probably should have been more precise. They had been\n0259,57 11 that powerful people can mount against the victims of 03:06:32 11 concealed from law enforcement, is what I meant. That\n03:00:01 12 sex trafficking. So to say that the young women in sex 0106:35 12 when Palm Beach Police Department went up to the Epstein\n03:00:04 13 trafficking schemes have the same power as their 0106:37 13 mansion, they found surveillance cameras and other\n03:00:07 14 traffickers to do this -- I'm sorry. I'm going to have 0106,41 14 cameras.

That they were premature.\n03:07:30 8 accurate term, the -- the evidence that we are trying to 03:09:48 8 Q. That's your understanding of his order?\n03:07:33 9 gather. 03:09:50 9 A. Yes.\n03:07:33 10 Q. In my answer -- in my answer -- 03:09:50 10 Q. Okay.\n03:07:33 11 A. Yeah. 03:09:54 11 A. And I -- maybe I should -- I see some\n0107:36 12 Q. -- in the question and answer, your answer to 03:0958 12 skepticism there, so let me explain why I think those\n03:07:38 13 my question a couple of questions ago, you talked about 03:10:00 13 allegations -\n0107:42 14 whether Mr. Epstein and Virginia Roberts would have the 03:10:01 14 Q. Yeah. Well, we can pull --\n03:07:46 15 same or equal ability to disclose -- 03:10:01 15 A. -- are appropriate.\n03'07:49 16 A. Right. 03:10:01 16 Q. -- we will pull out the order itself --\n03,07:49 17 Q. -- what these prominent politicians, 03:10:01 17 A. Sure.\n03:07:53 18 et cetera, had done, correct? 03:10:05 18 Q. -- at the appropriate time, but first, your\n03:07:54 19 A. Correct. 03:10:05 19 understanding is that the judge didn't find that those\n03:0755 20 Q. Without attempting to make any comparison, 03:10:09 20 allegations, at the time they were made, were so\n03:07:50 21 you would agree, would you not, that as of December 03:10:13 21 irrelevant to the case, that they should be stricken\n03:08:01 22 30th, 2014, Miss Roberts had the ability to name the 03:10:15 22 from the public record?\n0308:07 23 names of the people who are referenced in this document? 031017 23 A. In that pleading at that time, remember, we\n03:08:10 24 A. Physical ability, yes. 03:10:20 24 had in our -- our brief -- let me explain the — the\n03:0811 25 Q. And -- well, let me ask this: You say a 03:10:24 25 nine reasons why we thought that those allegations were\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n297 299\n03:08:17 1 well-known prime minister. Is that Prime Minister 03:10:27 1 relevant to the case, since I think your question calls\n53:08:22 2 Barak? 03:10:28 2 for that.\n03:08:22 3 MS. McCAWLEY: I'm gonna instruct you not to 0319:29 3 Q. Are those the nine reasons you gave\n03:08:25 4 reveal any attorney/client communications you had 03:10:31 4 yesterday?\n03:08:26 5 with Virginia Roberts on the specifics of her 03:10:31 5 A. No, I didn't have a chance to.\n03:08:29 6 counsel to you about these individuals. 0310:32 6 Q. Are they the nine reasons that are set forth\n03:08:31 7 BY MR. SIMPSON: 03:10:34 7 in your -- in your brief?\n03:08:32 8 Q. Is one of the other -- one of the powerful 03:10:35 8 A. They are. Those are the nine reasons that\n03,08:34 9 business executives, Les Wexner? 03:10:37 9 are set forth in the brief.\n03:0817 10 MS. McCAWLEY: Again, same instruction. 03:10:38 10 Q. Okay. And -- and Judge Marra had that brief\n03:08:40 11 BY MR. SIMPSON: 03:10:41 11 in front of him when he held that, these allegations\n03:08:41 12 Q. Okay. Now, you mentioned yesterday -- well, 03:10:45 12 were so not relevant to the issues before the court,\n03:0640 13 a moment ago, you testified that these -- in your view, 03:10:48 13 that they would be stricken and not part of the public\n03:08:51 14 these allegations about other powerful men furthered 03:10:52 14 record?\n03:08:58 15 Miss Roberts' legal position in the case, correct? 0310:52 15 A. At that time, in that particular pleading --\n03119:02 16 A. Yes. 03:10:55 16 I think you're mischaracterizing Judge Marra's ruling in\n0309:02 17 Q. And it's also your position, I assume, that 03:1100 17 its entirety. He specifically said that the allegations\n030910 18 the allegations regarding Professor Dershowitz and 03:11:01 18 could be reasserted, if they were relevant to issues\n03:09:14 19 Prince Andrew furthered Miss Roberts' legal position; is 03:11:04 19 that are -- that were coming up. And so, in following\n03:09:21 20 that right? 0371107 20 that ruling, we went to the U.S. Attorney's Office,\n030921 21 A. Absolutely. 03:11:10 21 propounded discovery requests and said, look, we believe\n03:09:21 22 Q. Does the fact that Judge Marra struck those 03:11:13 22 you're sitting on information that Dershowitz was, you\n03:0924 23 allegations as impertinent, scandalous, and completely 0111:16 23 know, connected with the -- with the criminal\n03:09:30 24 irrelevant to the case, cause you to reassess? 03:1117 24 trafficking here; we would like you to produce those\n03:09:32 25 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. Is that -- is that 0111,19 25 documents.\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n37 of 46 sheets Page 296 to 299 of 335 10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n300 302\n03:11:20 1 And rather than say, hey, we don't have any 011141 1 the United States Attorney for the Southern District of\n0311:22 2 such documents, the U.S. Attorney's Office gave us the 0113:45 2 Florida to represent victims, correct?\n03:11:26 3 response indicating, to our view, that there were such 011148 3 A. Yes. Through the -- through the NPA, yeah,\nD3:11:27 4 documents, and as you know, since you're one of 03:1151 4 there was an apparatus that led to his selection.\n03:11:29 5 Mr. Dershowitz's attorneys, we have drafted a pleading 0313:54 5 Q. And does that answer reflect holding the U.S.\n03:11:32 6 now to try and collect that information, that law 03:14:01 6 Attorney for the Southern District of Florida in that\n0111:36 7 enforce -- federal law enforcement agencies have 031403 7 office in high regard?\n031 1:39 8 collected, and -- and to figure out the appropriate way 0114:04 8 A. Sure.\n0111:42 9 to litigate that so that we can get that information and 0314:05 9 Q. Do you contend that at the time the United\n031 1:44 10 move forward with the case. 0314:11 10 States Attorney for the Southern District of Florida\n0111:46 11 That's just one example of -- of how the 031414 11 negotiated the NPA, they knew that Professor Dershowitz,\n03:11:49 12 allegations, if they were premature at that point, are 03:1420 12 himself, had been involved in abuse of minors?\n03:11:53 13 no longer going to be premature as the case moves along. 03:14:25 13 A. I don't know exactly what information they\n03:11:57 14 Q. Is it or is it not your understanding that 03:14:27 14 had. I do know that we have been propounding discovery\n0112:01 15 Judge Marra ruled that the allegations in this pleading 03:14:30 15 requests on all of these subjects, including\n03:12:08 16 in front of you were so irrelevant to the pleading in 03:14:32 16 Professor Dershowitz's involvement, when the U.S.\n0312:14 17 which they were stated, that they should be stricken 03:14:35 17 Attorney knew. They are asserting privilege over that.\n011217 18 from the public record? 03:14:37 18 I would wish they would waive the privilege or at least\n03:12:18 19 A. In that particular pleading at that 031439 19 provide the information to pro bono crime victims'\n03:1220 20 particular time, that's right. 03:14:43 20 attorneys that they have, so we can get to the bottom of\n03:12:21 21 Q. Does that cause you to reassess, in any way, 03:14:45 21 this.\n03:12:24 22 having filed this document? 03:14:45 22 But there have been, you know, a nonstop\n03:12:25 23 A. Well, I think certainly as a tactical matter, 03:14:47 23 series of assertions of privilege and other barriers\n0112:28 24 we should have reserved the -- the allegations for -- 0314:49 24 interposed against us in this case, and I think\n03:1231 25 for another motion. I -- I think that's -- you know,\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n031453 25 inappropriately so, and -- and we have been arguing that\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n301 303\n03:12:34 1 certainly, with the -- you're -- now, we are now sort of 03:14:55 1 now for a number of years.\n03:12:38 2 speculating, would we have done something different if 0314:56 2 Q. Would you agree with me that if the United\n03:12:39 3 we knew that? And the answer to that is, sure, we would 03:15:00 3 States Attorney's Office had been aware that Professor\n031241 4 have tried to do something that Judge Marra thought was 03:15:04 4 Dershowitz had engaged in sexual misconduct with minors,\n0312:44 5 the appropriate way to handle it, so... 03:15:07 5 or himself had observed Mr. Epstein do so, that it would\n03:12:46 6 Q. And Judge Marra also reminded counsel of 03:1512 6 have been improper and unethical for them to let Mr. --\n0312:49 7 their Rule 11 obligations; didn't he? 03:15:17 7 Professor Dershowitz negotiate the terms of the NPA with\n0312:51 8 A. That's right. Yeah. 03:1519 8 them?\n011252 9 Q. And did it cause you to question, not 031519 9 A. If they had direct personal knowledge of\n03;12:57 10 tactics, but whether you were acting properly in filing 03:1521 10 that, sure. I mean, the -- the -- but the realities are\n03:13:00 11 this? 03:1123 11 a little bit more complicated in that Professor\n03:13:00 12 MR. SCAROLA: Excuse me. I -- 03:1126 12 Dershowitz, over the last couple of days as\n03:13:02 13 MR. SIMPSON: I'm just asking if it caused 0315:27 13 frequently -- has frequently used the word \"continuum,\"\n03:13:03 14 him to reassess. 03:15:29 14 and so if they were certain of that, it absolutely would\n03:13:04 15 MR. SCAROLA: I understand what you're 031131 15 have -- would have been unethical.\n03:13:05 16 asking, and you're asking him about his mental 011533 16 The question is: Well, what if they had a\n03:13:07 17 processes in connection with pending litigation. 03:1135 17 suspicion or what if -- you know, a reasonable suspicion\n03:1112 18 That's work product. I instruct you not to 0315:36 18 or a possible suspicion. Those are the kinds of\n031113 19 answer that question. 0115:39 19 dimensions that you've got to, you know, take into\n031314 20 BY MR. SIMPSON: 011142 20 account in the real world about, you know, what they .-\n0113:15 21 Q. All right. You testified yesterday that one 03:15,44 21 what they would have done.\n03:13:19 22 reason that you found the filing of the complaint on 03:15:50 22 I mean, it seems pretty clear, for example,\n0313:27 23 behalf of Jane Doe 102, who is Virginia Roberts, by 031152 23 that at some point, you know, later on, they got a black\n03:13:34 24 the -- Bob )osefsberg and -- and why that was 03:15,55 24 book in which Professor Dershowitz's name had been\n03:13:37 25 significant was that Bob )osefsberg had been selected by 03:15:58 25 circled. Now, what they did with that information, I --\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM Page 300 to 303 of 335 38 of 46 sheets\n304 306\n03:18:00 1 I don't know. 0317:59 1 certainly believe i have a good-faith basis, along with\n0316:00 2 Q. And what they did with the fact that Courtney 03:18:02 2 my co-counsel, to explore that subject, and try to see\n0316:04 3 Love and Donald Trump were circled, you don't know also, 03:18:04 3 how someone who is fifth in line to the British Throne\n031006 4 correct? 03:18:07 4 might have been able to use the contacts and power that\n03:16:06 5 A. That's right. Fair point. 03:1809 5 he has to influence a -- a -- a disposition in this --\n0116:07 6 Q. But somehow it's suspicious as to 03:18:15 6 in the Crime Victims' Rights Act case that it would have\n03:16:10 7 Mr. Dershowitz, but not as to anyone else? 03:1019 7 been favorable to one of his friends and potentially\n03:16:12 8 MR. SCAROLA: Objection. Argumentative. 03:18:23 8 favorable to himself.\n03:16:12 9 THE WITNESS: And I'm -- I'm glad to argue on 03:18:23 9 Q. And -- and you have that view,\n03:16:14 10 that point, let me, because they -- 03:18:25 10 notwithstanding that the government had represented they\n03:16:14 11 MR. SIMPSON: I'll withdraw the question. 03:18:27 11 have no record of that?\n03:16:15 12 THE WITNESS: All right. Because I would 03:18:30 12 A. They didn't -- no, no, no, no. Let's not \"...\n011616 13 have a -- 03:18:31 13 not -- let's not slip and try to get me to admit\n03:16:16 14 MR. SIMPSON: Let -- 031634 14 something that is not what the record reflects. The\n0316:17 15 THE WITNESS: -- a substantial argument on 03:18:36 15 government said they did not have documents. They did\n03:16:18 16 that. 03:18:38 16 not say that they didn't have any information along\n03:1610 17 MR. SIMPSON: I -- I will withdraw the 03:18:40 17 those lines.\n03:16:20 18 question. 031041 18 To the contrary: They asserted a whole\n03:16:20 19 BY MR. SIMPSON: 03:18:43 19 series of privileges every time we tried to get\n031028 20 Q. With respect, again, to the -- 0318:47 20 information along these lines. So the fact that they\n031610 21 MR. SCAROLA: And I'll withdraw the 03:18:49 21 didn't have a letter, signed Prince Andrew, saying,\n03:1632 22 objection. 03:18:51 22 please do the best you can for this convicted sex\n031632 23 MR.

At the time that you filed this joinder 0118:57 25 But they never said that they -- they -- that\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n305 307\n03:16:40 1 motion, Exhibit 2, you knew that the United States 031900 1 something along these lines had never happened and, to\n03:16:44 2 Attorney's Office had denied having any contact -- any 0119:03 2 the contrary, we were faced with assertions of privilege\n03:16:48 3 documents reflecting any contact with Prince Andrew; 03:19:07 3 over roughly, if i remember correctly, about 10,000\n0316:51 4 isn't that true? 0319:08 4 pages of documents where a whole host of privileges were\n03:1601 5 A. They had -- there were -- there were various 03:19:11 5 being asserted.\n03:16:56 6 discovery requests that had been propounded, and I think 031912 6 Q. Do you think it's credible that the United\n03:1669 7 with regard to one, they had denied, and my recollection 03,19:16 7 States Attorney's Office would be discussing an NPA with\n03:17:01 8 is with regard to another, where there had been an 0319:20 8 a member of the British Royal Family?\n03:17:04 9 assertion of privilege. 0319:22 9 A. Not directly, but there certainly are\n03:17:07 10 Q. Is it not true, that before December 30th, 03:19:24 10 possibilities of surrogates. I -- my -- somebody who is\n03:17:09 11 2014, in response to a request asking the government: 0119:27 11 that powerful certainly wouldn't go out at it directly.\n03:1715 12 Are there any documents reflecting contact with -- by 03:1929 12 What they would probably do is try to find the best\n03:17:20 13 Prince Andrew regarding the NPA, the government 03:19:32 13 lawyers they could around the United States and -- and,\n03:1724 14 represented, there were none? 03:19:33 14 you know, and some of the, you know, big-named lawyers\n03:17:26 15 A. That -- with regard to the -- you're talking 03:1036 15 and try to bring them in there to -- to work a deal.\n03:17:30 16 about RFPs, request for production of documents, I 0319:38 16 That's, I think, how, you know, we're -- you're\n0317:32 17 believe that's -- I believe that's correct. 03:19:42 17 asking -- your question is asking for speculation and\n03:17:33 18 Q. And on December 30th, 2014, knowing that, you 0119:42 18 I'm saying that -- that based on, how would you\n0317:38 19 named Prince Andrew in this motion, correct? 0319:46 19 influence a deal in an American criminal justice system?\n03:1740 20 A. Correct. 03:19:49 20 You go try to get the best defense lawyers you could and\n0317:41 21 Q. And is it your testimony that you believe 03:19:52 21 see -- you know -- you know, figure out which political\n0117:4622 that Prince Andrew somehow attempted to influence the 0119:54 22 party was in power; and try to get people who are\n011762 23 negotiations of an NPA in the United States as to 03:19,58 23 well-connected to that political party, things like\n0317:56 24 Mr. Epstein? 0319:58 24 that.\n03:17:57 25 A. I don't have direct evidence of that, but I 03:19,59 25 So that's the way that I think somebody might\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400 (954) 331-4400\n39 of 46 sheets Page 304 to 307 of 335 10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n308 310\n03:20:01 1 have gone about trying to -- to put pressure for a -- a 03:2217 1 know -- I can't recall sitting here today whether\n0320:04 2 favorable plea deal. 03:22:20 2 Nightline, is that an ABC program or NBC or -- or some\n03:20:06 3 Q.

Those three sentences, three lines. 03:38:34 6 that -- you know, I will concede that I cited the wrong\n03:36:55 7 Q. What -- yes, what the brief cites. 03:38:38 7 line number for that particular assertion.\n03:36:57 8 A. Those -- those three lines: \"Not sure. When 03,38:41 8 Q.

How often did he 03:38:43 9 say the wrong line number, if you look at the quotation,\n033736 10 come?\" Those -- those three lines, I agree, that looks 03:38:46 10 there is, up above -- you cited 18 to 20 -- 22 to 25 --\n03:37:10 11 like a miscitation there. I agree with you on that. 03:38:46 11 no, 18 to 20. I'm sorry. You cited 18 to 20 which is\n03:3714 12 Q. And isn't it true that -- first of all, 03:38:56 12 -- do you see that?\n0337:16 13 nothing else is cited in the brief or elsewhere to 03:38:57 13 A. I do see 18 to 20, yes.\n03:37:22 14 support -- put -- put aside. 0338:59 14 Q. And those lines don't refer to Virginia\n033723 15 Other than Virginia Roberts's own testimony, 033931 15 Roberts coming to the house, correct?\n0137:26 16 this is the only evidence that you cited to the court to 03:39:02 16 A.

I'm getting a\n03:37:47 3 do agree with me that what was cited to the court for 03:39:37 3 little fuzzy here. When Mr. Dershowitz was visiting,\n03:37:50 4 the proposition that they were together, in this 033340 4 uh-huh, could be an affirmative answer read in context\n03:37:52 5 sentence, doesn't support that proposition? 013345 5 to saying, I don't recall about Prince Andrew, but I do\n033734 6 A. I will agree with you that there appears to 03:39:47 6 recall Virginia Roberts being there. And I think when\n03:37:56 7 be a miscitation of the line number -- of the lines 18 0339:49 7 we unpack the entirety of the deposition, which we don't\n0138:01 8 through 20. 0339:52 8 have time right now, that the context that I'm\n03:38:02 9 Now, you're saying that there is not 03:39:54 9 suggesting now would be accurate. So I am not prepared\n03:3304 10 information outside of 8 -- lines 18 through 20 to 03:39:57 10 to say, as I sit here right now, that those were the\n033838 11 support the allegation, and that's going to require a 033939 11 wrong line numbers.\n0338:11 12 much longer answer. 03:4301 12 Perhaps those are the correct line numbers,\n03:38:1213 Q. I don't want a long answer, but I do want to 03:40:0313 but what I think I should have done was to cite\n03:38:15 14 clarify. When you say \"outside\" -- 03:40:05 14 additional parts of the transcript that would have, in\n0338:15 15 MR.
