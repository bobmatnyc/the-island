  "text": "a dissociative trance as my father drove me to the local National Guard\nArmory, where | was prostituted to Ford. He took me into an empty room,\npushed me down on the wooden floor as he unzipped his pants and said,\n‘Pray on this.’ Then he brutally, sexually assaulted me. Afterward, my\n\nmemory was compartmentalized through use of high voltage. | was then\ncarried out to the car where | lay in the back seat, muscles contracted,\nstunned, in pain, and unable to move.”\n\nAnd then there was Dick Cheney, President Ford’ s chief of staff.\nAfter Cathy was hunted down and caught in Cheney’ s game of “human\nhunting,” she stood naked in his hunting-lodge office as he paced around\nand gave her this choice: “I could stuff you and mount you like a\njackalope and call you a two-legged deer. Or | could stuff you with this--he\nunzipped his pants to reveal his oversized penis--right down your throat\nand then mount you. Which do you prefer?”\n\nApparently, Cheney’ s oversized penis balanced out Senator Byrd’ s\ntiny penis--a tawdry version of Emerson’ s Law of Compensation.\n\nCathy specialized in political figures (although she was also thrust\nupon by country singers such as “CIA operatives” Merle Haggard and\nKris Kristofferson). With unintentional prophetic irony, Cathy described her\n\n1983 meeting with Ronald Reagan, George Bush and Dick Cheney:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015231",
