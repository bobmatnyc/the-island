But Syria's internal troubles might just as easily\nhave a negative effect.\n\nUndoubtedly, the failed peace process has bred extreme frustration\namong Palestinian militants, some of whom may think that a sharp\nshock is needed to wrench international attention away from the Arab\ndemocratic wave and back to the Palestine problem. They are anxious\nto alert the United States and Europe to the danger of allowing the\npeace process to sink into a prolonged coma. Israeli hard-liners, too,\nmay calculate that a short war could serve their purpose: Prime\nMinister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right government may sense\nweakness and quietly dream of finishing off Hamas once and for all.\nSyria has been a strong supporter of Hamas and has given a base in\nDamascus to the head of its political bureau, Khaled Mashal. Turmoil\nin Damascus could deal Hamas a severe blow.\n\nOn all these fronts -- Iran, Iraq, Turkey, Lebanon, Palestine, Israel --\nSyria is a key player. But its internal problems now threaten to\nreshuffle the cards, adding to the general sense of insecurity and\nlatent violence in the region. And of all the threats facing the Middle\nEast, perhaps the greatest -- greater even than of another Arab-Israeli\nclash -- is that of rampant sectarianism, poisoning relationships\nbetween and within states, and breeding hate, intolerance, and\nmistrust.\n\nSeveral of the modern states of the Middle East -- and Syria is no\nexception -- were built on a mosaic of ancient religions, sects, and\nethnic groups held uneasily and sometimes uncomfortably together\nby central government. But governments have themselves been far\nfrom neutral, favoring one community over another in cynical power\nplays. Many Sunni Muslims in Syria and throughout the region feel\nthat Assad's Syria has unduly favored the Alawites, a sect of Shiite\nIslam, who constitute some 12 percent of the population but control a\nvastly greater percentage of the country's wealth.
