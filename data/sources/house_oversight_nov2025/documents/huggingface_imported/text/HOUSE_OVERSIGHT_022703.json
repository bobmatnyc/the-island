The logs also show him flying with former advisor Ira Magaziner, ex-Transportation\n\nSecretary Rodney Slater, and fashion model Naomi Campbell.\n\nThe pilots’ documents also leave numerous and — understandably — intriguing questions unanswered: Clinton was on four flights\nwith women identified as only “Janice” and “Jessica,” who have not been identified; he once flew with a person identified only as\n“one female” and also, during part of the trip throughout Africa, a young woman named Chauntae Davies, who appears in\nEpstein’s phone directly under the massage category and whose expertise in Swedish massage was described in Gawker's story\nmentioning her last week. And because the entries are hand-written in a very cramped log form, it’s impossible to know if\n\nimportant names ended up illegible or left out altogether, nor if there are other logs that have not been revealed.\n\nBut based on what's in the court files, there are no further clues about those flights, other than the testimony and public\nstatements of Roberts, who has described the airplane as a kind of high-altitude Gomorrah. What is on the record is a deposition\nof Larry Visoski, one of Epstein’s former pilots, who recalls having Clinton on his plane as many as 20 times. When asked, “Do you\n\nremember him being on the airplane with younger girls?” Visoski replies, simply, “No.”\n\nClinton flew literally around the world with Epstein, traveling from New York to London, to Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand,\nMorocco, Portugal, Russia, and throughout Africa. In almost every case, according to cross-referenced information on his speaking\nengagements, Clinton was apparently traveling for professional reasons, and, according to the logs, he never flew with his wealthy\n\nfriend anywhere near the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n\nThat does little to bolster statements by Roberts, who in a 2011 conversation with her lawyers (which both Vew York Post's Page\nSixand Radar Online described as an “interview”) claimed Clinton traveled to Epstein’s infamous retreat on Little St. James Island\nin 2002.\n\nEarlier this month, it was reported that Roberts is writing a “tell-all” memoir about her experiences. In a sworn affidavit filed in\ncourt last week, she claimed to have had sex with Epstein, Dershowitz, England’s Prince Andrew, and several other men on\nnumerous occasions, and portrayed a three-year period ending in 2002 when Epstein passed her off to his friends continually. But,\nshe added, “I have never had sexual relations with Clinton, nor have I claimed to have had such relations. I have never seen him\n\nhave sexual relations with anyone.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022703",
