  "text": "LET’S ASPIRE TO MORE THAN MAKING OURSELVES OBSOLETE\nMax Tegmark\n\nMax Tegmark is an MIT physicist and AI researcher; president of the Future of Life\nInstitute; scientific director of the Foundational Questions Institute; and the author\nof Our Mathematical Universe and Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial\nIntelligence.\n\nAlthough there’s great controversy about how and when AI will impact humanity, the\nsituation is clearer from a cosmic perspective: The technology-developing life that has\nevolved on Earth is rushing to make itself obsolete without devoting much serious\nthought to the consequences. This strikes me as embarrassingly lame, given that we can\ncreate amazing opportunities for humanity to flourish like never before, if we dare to\nsteer a more ambitious course.\n\n13.8 billion years after its birth, our Universe has become aware of itself. On a\nsmall blue planet, tiny conscious parts of our Universe have discovered that what they\nonce thought was the sum total of existence was a minute part of something far grander: a\nsolar system in a galaxy in a universe with over 100 billion other galaxies, arranged into\nan elaborate pattern of groups, clusters, and superclusters.\n\nConsciousness is the cosmic awakening; it transformed our Universe from a\nmindless zombie with no self-awareness into a living ecosystem harboring self-reflection,\nbeauty, hope, meaning, and purpose. Had that awakening never taken place, our\nUniverse would have been pointless—a gigantic waste of space. Should our Universe go\nback to sleep permanently due to some cosmic calamity or self-inflicted mishap, it will\nbecome meaningless again.\n\nOn the other hand, things could get even better. We don’t yet know whether we\nhumans are the only stargazers in the cosmos, or even the first, but we’ve already learned\nenough about our Universe to know that it has the potential to wake up much more fully\nthan it has thus far. AI pioneers such as Norbert Wiener have taught us that a further\nawakening of our Universe’s ability to process and experience information need not\nrequire eons of additional evolution but perhaps mere decades of human scientific\ningenuity.\n\nWe may be like that first glimmer of self-awareness you experienced when you\nemerged from sleep this morning, a premonition of the much greater consciousness that\nwould arrive once you opened your eyes and fully awoke. Perhaps artificial\nsuperintelligence will enable life to spread throughout the cosmos and flourish for\nbillions or trillions of years, and perhaps this will be because of decisions we make here,\non our planet, in our lifetime.\n\nOr humanity may soon go extinct, through some self-inflicted calamity caused by\nthe power of our technology growing faster than the wisdom with which we manage it.\n\nThe evolving debate about AI’s societal impact\n\nMany thinkers dismiss the idea of superintelligence as science fiction, because they view\nintelligence as something mysterious that can exist only in biological organisms—\nespecially humans—and as fundamentally limited to what today’s humans can do. But\nfrom my perspective as a physicist, intelligence is simply a certain kind of information\n\n63\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016283",
