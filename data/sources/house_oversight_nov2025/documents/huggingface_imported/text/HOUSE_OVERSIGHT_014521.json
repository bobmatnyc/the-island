  "text": "TAX ALERT 2016-5: THE 2016 ELECTION: TAX CHANGES EXPECTED\n\nValuation discounts. On August 2, 2016, the IRS released proposed regulations, which may limit valuation\ndiscounts for transfers of interests in family-controlled entities.2 These regulations contain many ambiguities,\nand the IRS requested comments and held a public hearing on December 1, 2016. The regulations are\ncontroversial, many comments were sent and only a few clarifying changes were provided at the hearing. Asa\nresult of the election, we believe it is likely the IRS will not proceed with these regulations. For now, there has\n\nbeen no official word from the IRS.\n\nPlanning. The proposal to repeal the federal estate tax appears straightforward, but will be complicated if it is\ntemporary. The possibility of reinstatement of the estate tax may be a reason for traditional estate planning\ntechniques, such as gifts and sales, to continue to be utilized. There is also significant uncertainty as to the related\nfederal gift tax and basis step-up proposals. This makes current planning difficult because you may be comparing\nthe consequences of taking action currently (such as making a gift), with the uncertain future consequences of\nnot taking such action. Nevertheless, there are some general guidelines to consider.\n\ne It does not appear advisable to make a current gift that requires the payment of gift tax. Although\nthe gift tax may be less costly than the estate tax, that would not be true if the estate tax is repealed.\n\ne There are many types of “free” gifts that do not require the payment of gift tax, such as annual\nexclusion gifts, tuition and medical gifts, gifts utilizing the lifetime gift exemption, and zeroed-out\nGRATs.\n\no If such gifts are being considered only to save estate tax, it does not appear necessary to make\nthese gifts, unless there is an applicable state estate tax*. However, if repeal is temporary\nand the estate tax will be reinstated, then such gifts may continue to be advisable.\n\no If such gifts are being considered for other non-tax reasons (such as benefitting the recipient\nor asset protection), such gifts may still be beneficial. Even if the gift tax were repealed, you\nwould still have made the gift for free.\n\no Ifa gift will be made currently, it may be advisable to include flexible provisions, such as a\ntrust which allows for discretionary distributions to the donor’s spouse. This could allow the\ngift to be “undone” in the future by distributions to such spouse, if that becomes desirable.\n\nAs to future planning, it will obviously depend on what changes are enacted. If the estate tax is repealed, or if\nother significant changes are made, all wills, trusts and estate planning documents should be reviewed to\ndetermine if any revisions are desirable. Since most wills have dispositive provisions, such as credit shelter trusts\nand QTIP trusts, based on the estate tax, it will require a re-thinking of estate planning and what dispositions and\ntrusts would be appropriate. Non-tax considerations, such as trust provisions, asset protection and fiduciary\nselection, will play an enhanced role. If federal estate tax repeal is only temporary, it will presumably be necessary\nto include alternate dispositive provisions, in case the tax is reinstated.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe results of the 2016 election are expected to lead to significant income and transfer tax changes, some through\nthe potential repeal of the Affordable Care Act and others through a push for comprehensive tax reform. In this\nTax Alert, we have highlighted some of the tax proposals, and the possible impact these changes may have on\n\n3 We have a separate Tax Alert 2016-3, Proposed Regulations May Limit/Eliminate Valuation Discounts for Family Controlled\nEntities.\n\n4“ Certain states impose their own estate tax, independent of whether the federal estate tax is repealed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014521",
