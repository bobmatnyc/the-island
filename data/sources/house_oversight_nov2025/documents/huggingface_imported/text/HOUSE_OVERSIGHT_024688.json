  "text": "ACKRELL\nCAPITAL\n\nCannabis Investment Report | December 2017\n\nVaporizers and Accessories\n\nSmoking or vaporizing cannabis flower or concentrates is the most popular method of cannabis con-\nsumption, in part because the effects of inhaled cannabis smoke or vapor begin almost immediately.\nAccessories used to smoke cannabis include glass, wood or metal pipes; glass or plastic water pipes\nknown as “bongs”; and cigarette papers used to roll “joints.” A vaporizer is a device that heats cannabis\nflower or concentrate to a temperature at which its active compounds boil and can be inhaled as vapor.\nVaporizers are increasing in popularity faster than any other cannabis-consumption device, in some\nmeasure because vaporizing is perceived by many as a healthier method of cannabis consumption than\nsmoking. Distinguishing features of a vaporizer include whether it vaporizes flower or concentrate, the\nform of the heating mechanism, or “atomizer,” power output, battery efficiency, durability, reusability\n(there are both refillable and disposable vaporizers) and design aesthetics. Hundreds of vaporizers are\nmarketed, ranging from simple to complex, including handheld vaporizers that retail for $10 to $500\nand. tabletop vaporizers that retail for $100 to more than $1,000.\n\nindica midnight berry\n\n=\n\nVaporizers\n\n52 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024688",
