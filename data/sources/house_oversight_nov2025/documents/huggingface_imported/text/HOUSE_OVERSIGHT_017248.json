  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nJustice Brennan had agreed to join a short dissent from the denial of certiorari in Rudolph v.\nAlabama (1963)—a case involving imposition of the death\n\npenalty on a black man who was convicted of raping a white woman. Justice William O. Douglas\nsigned on as well. The dissenters invited the bar to address the following questions, which they\ndeemed “relevant and worthy of argument and consideration”:\n\n1. In light of the trend both in the country and throughout the\nworld against punishing rape by death, does the imposition of\nthe death penalty by those States which retain it for rape violate\n“evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of\n\n[our] maturing society,” or “standards of decency more or less\nuniversally accepted’?\n\n2. Is the taking of human life to protect a value other than human\nlife consistent with the constitutional proscription against\n“punishments which by their excessive...severity are greatly\ndisproportional to the offenses charged’?\n\n3. Can the permissible aims of punishment (e.g., deterrence, isolation,\nrehabilitation) be achieved as effectively by punishing\n\nrape less severely than by death (e.g., by life imprisonment); if\n\nso, does the imposition of the death penalty for rape constitute\n“unnecessary cruelty’?\n\nAs soon as the dissent was published, there was an immediate reaction. Conservative journalists\nhad a field day lambasting the very notion that a court could strike down as unconstitutional a\nlong-standing punishment that is explicitly referred to in the Constitution.\n\nOne extreme criticism appeared in the New Hampshire Union Leader under the banner headline\n“U.S. Supreme Court Trio Encourages Rape”:\n\nIn a decision handed down last week three U.S. Supreme Court justices, Goldberg,\nBrennan, Douglas, raised the question of whether it was proper to condemn a man to\ndeath for the crime of rape if there has been no endangering of the life of the victim. This\nincredible opinion, of course, can serve only to encourage would-be rapists. These fiends,\nfreed from the fear of the death penalty for their foul deed, . . .will be inclined to take a\nchance.\n\nThus, not content with forbidding our schoolchildren to pray in school, not content with\nbanishing Bible reading from our schools, and not content letting every type of filthy book\nbe published, at least three members of the Supreme Court are now out to encourage rape.\n\nThe editorial did not mention that New Hampshire had abolished the death penalty for rape\n\ngenerations ago and had one of the lowest rates of rape in the country—far lower than states that\nstill executed convicted rapists.\n\n161\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017248",
