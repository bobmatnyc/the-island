Are you following what’s happening here? What do\nyou think?”\n\nI recognized the voice immediately: Ezer Weizman, the former fighter pilot\nBegin had chosen as his defense minister. I’d known Ezer since the early 1960s,\nwhen he’d been commander of the air force and Sayeret Matkal was planning\nits first operations. Still, even though he had a reputation for batting ideas back\nand forth outside the bounds of hierarchy or chain of command, I was startled to\nhear from him.\n\n“What do I think about what?” I said.\n\n“The solution we’ ve arrived at here. We found there was no way but to give\nback everything.” The only exception was Taba, a sliver of land where the\nNegev met the eastern edge of the Sinai, across from the Jordanian town of\nAqaba.\n\n“Was there no way to convince them, even with some kind of a land swap, to\nkeep the two air bases?” I asked.\n\n“Believe me, we wanted to,” Ezer replied. “But no way.

It had a fenced-off\nplay area for the children and, in a common room for all the village residents, an\nupright piano.\n\nI found the richness of the academic environment — and the time to explore\nand savor it — enthralling. I’d chosen my master’s program at Stanford because\nit offered the chance to learn across a range of different schools and disciplines.\nThe official home for my degree courses was the School of Engineering, in a\ndepartment called ““Engineering-Economic Systems’’. Its focus was on applying\nmathematical modelling and analysis to decision-making in “large and complex\n\n185\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028033",
