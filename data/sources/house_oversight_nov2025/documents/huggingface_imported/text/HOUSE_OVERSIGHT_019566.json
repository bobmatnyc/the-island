By this time, as we know, he had already\nagreed to deliver classified data to three journalists.\n\nSnowden believed that bringing complaints to NSA lawyers or\nsupervisors was, as he put it, “playing with fire.” “When I was at\nNSA,” Snowden later said in Moscow, “everybody knew that for\nanything more serious than workplace harassment, going through\nthe official process was a career-ender at best.”\n\nNevertheless, on April 5, 2013, while still in the training facility\nin Maryland, he apparently sought to establish a paper trail for him-\nself. He wrote a letter to NSA’s Office of the General Counsel asking\nwhether or not NSA directives take precedence over acts of Con-\ngress. A lawyer from the Office of the General Counsel responded\nthree days later, addressing Snowden as “Dear Ed.” The lawyer said\nthat acts of Congress take precedence over NSA directives. He also\nsuggested that “Ed” phone him if he needed any further clarifica-\ntion. Presumably, Snowden had asked the question to elicit a reply\nhe could later use to bolster his claim that the NSA had ignored or\n\n© rejected policies regarding NSA directives. Instead, the “Dear Ed” ©\nresponse was of little use to Snowden, because it did not dispute his\npoint that NSA directives must lawfully conform to the acts of Con-\ngress. The NSA lawyer never heard back from “Ed.”\n\nSnowden completed his orientation course at Fort Meade on Fri-\nday, April 12, 2013. While he was in Maryland, he took time off to\npay visits to both of his divorced parents. It would be the last time he\nwould see either of them in the United States.\n\nHe returned on April 13 to Hawaii. One domestic task he had to\nattend to was helping Mills pack up their possessions, which they\nstored in boxes in the garage. The lease on their house was up on\nApril 30, 2013, and they had to move. According to Mills, they found\na temporary rental just a few blocks away.\n\nOn Monday, April 15, Snowden began on-the-job training as\nan analyst at the National Threat Operations Center. He would\nnot complete the course. The same week he began the training, he\nprepared his exit by writing to Booz Allen and saying he needed a\nbrief medical leave in May to undergo treatment for epilepsy symp-\ntoms. As far as is known, he did not suffer from epilepsy. Booz Allen\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 78 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019566",
