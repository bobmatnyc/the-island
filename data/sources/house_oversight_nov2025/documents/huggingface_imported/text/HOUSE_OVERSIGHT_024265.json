The famously libertarian Electronic Frontier Foundation recently released a white\npaper in which it acknowledged a line between a clash of ideas and flat-out harassment, with\nthe latter causing less rather than more robust debate. Separately, concerns about outright\nfalse news that spreads virally have inspired calls for action by intermediaries like Facebook -- a\nself-described technology, rather than media, company.\n\nApplying lessons from the conflicts of the past two decades online, how might we agree upon a\nvision for social networking even if we disagree on many substantive issues to be debated\nthere, and what are the roles, if any, of regulators and private platforms in establishing\nboundaries on behavior online through code or legal sanction?\n\nIs it more difficult to agree on a vision is our media is no longer about the battlefield or the real\nworld but /s the battlefield and the real world?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024265",
