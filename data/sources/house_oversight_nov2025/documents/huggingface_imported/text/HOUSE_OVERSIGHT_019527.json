Workers, both\nmilitary and civilian, entered through an exterior staircase in the\ncenter of the mound. Even though it is above the ground, it is known\nas the tunnel. Snowden said in describing the atmosphere, “ You're in\na vaulted space. Everybody has sort of similar clearances, everybody\nknows everybody. It’s a small world.” He said that to relieve the\ntediousness of the work, every two months or so his fellow work-\ners would circulate a picture of a naked person that showed up on\ntheir screens as part of the NSA’s surveillance of foreign suspects. He\nexplained, “You've got young enlisted guys, 18 to 22 years old [who\nhave] suddenly been thrust into a position of extraordinary respon-\nsibility where they now have access to all of your private records. In\nthe course of their daily work they stumble across ...an intimate\nnude photo of someone in a sexually compromising position.”\n\nHe knew that copying any files, including photographs, was a vio-\nlation of NSA rules. But he did not report this illicit activity to the\nNSA, even though he later claimed that it occurred regularly.

Paul was running\nin the 2012 Republican presidential primaries, and Snowden made\na contribution of $500 to his election committee. Snowden’s attrac-\ntion to Paul’s libertarian ideology was not that surprising. At the\ncore of Paul’s worldview was a deep hostility to the intrusion of the\ngovernment into private lives. Snowden shared this hostility, as was\nclear from his Internet postings. Like other Libertarians, Snowden\nbelieved that citizens should not be “shackled” by federal law.
