The Syrians are good judges of their\nadversaries’ weaknesses, and what they see in Washington is a\npresident who prefers the Assads to the possibility of chaos. They\nrealize that the measures taken until now by the United States and\nEurope have been relatively gentle, therefore wholly ineffective. Add\nto that the U.N. Security Council’s recent failure to condemn Syria\nand official Arab support for Syrian stability, and you will grasp why\nthe Assad regime saw an opening to reinforce American paralysis.\nNor can the Obama administration ignore that the Syrian leadership\nregards American dithering as a sign of implicit approval of its\nactions. Indeed, Shaaban described the recent statements of President\nBarack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton on Syria as “not\ntoo bad,” and the sanctions against Syria as manageable. That can\nonly mean one thing: If Washington fails to clarify its views on the\ncarnage in Syria through effective policies, the killing and the arrests\nthere will continue, with the U.S. bearing partial responsibility. The\nWhite House’s uncertainty can be measured in human lives.\n\nThe Syrian protesters are right in not pursuing their salvation in\nWashington, let alone Brussels, Paris, or London. This is not an\nAmerican administration overly outraged by the viciousness of\ndictatorships. Even in Egypt, Obama only turned against Hosni\nMubarak when he was left with no other choice — although doing so\nagainst an old ally while sparing Assad suggests that Obama is like\nthe coward who will yell at his wife to avoid a brawl with the\nneighbor.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030079",
