One employee said in an\nemail cited in the government’s complaint “Flushed everything like a dead goldfish.” As a result,\nsome of information specialists entering the NSA through the back door of outside contractors\nwere not fully vetted. (On August 20, 2015 USIS agreed to forfeit $30 million in fees to settle\nthe law suit.)\n\nUSIS was also opened to sophisticated hacking attacks by outsiders. For example, in August\n2014, the Department of Homeland Security’s counterintelligence unit discovered such a massive\nand persistent breach in USIS that it shut down its entire exchange of data with USIS. The\nintrusion into USIS records in this case was attributed to hackers in China most likely linked to\nthe Chinese intelligence service. Such massive intrusions dated back to 2011. USIS’ lack of\nsecurity in its website left a gaping hole through which outside parties, including Chinese and\nRussian hackers, could learn both the identity and background of information specialists applying\nfor jobs at the NSA.\n\nThese private companies had one further security weakness. They did sufficiently protect the\npersonal data of their off-premise employees working at the NSA. Consider, for example, the\nsuccessful 2011 attack on the Booz Allen Hamilton servers. The previously-mentioned hackers'\ngroup “Anonymous” took credit for it. It not only breached the security of Booz Allen servers\nbut cracked the algorithms it used to protect its employees. It next injected so-called Trojan-\nhorse viruses and other malicious codes on Booz Allen servers that allowed it to have future\nentry. Presumably, if amateur hackers such as Anonymous could break into the computers of the\nNSA’s largest contractor, so could the state espionage services with far more advanced hacking\ntools such as those of Russia and China. From these sites, an adversary intelligence service\ncould obtain all the job applications and personal resumes submitted to contractors such as Booz\nAllen. It could then compile a list of the candidates looking to work at the NSA.\n\nThese deficiencies in the private sector were compounded by the failure of security in the\ngovernment’s own Office of Personnel Management. It used a computer system called E-QIP in\nwhich intelligence employees with security clearances, including outside contractors, updated\ntheir computerized records to maintain or upgrade their security clearances. For example,\nSnowden updated his clearance in 2011. To do so, these employees constantly updated their\nfinancial and personal information. As it turned out, there was a major hole in the E-QIP system.\nIt was repeatedly hacked since 2010 by unknown parties. In 2015, the US government told\nCongress that China was most likely responsible but Russia and other nations with sophisticated\ncyber services could have also participated in the hacking. In any case, the records of over 19\nmillion employees, including intelligence workers, became available to a hostile intelligence\nservice. This breach would allow hostile services a great deal of information about independent\ncontractors working at the NSA. They could then use this data to follow the movements of\nmovement of any of these intelligence workers they deemed of interest.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020319",
