  "text": "The Last Election\n\nThe Republicans’ party line that Barack Obama was “palling\naround with terrorists” didn’ t work, although some people believed it\nbecause then they wouldn’ t need a racist reason not to vote for Obama.\nNext, the campaign acted as though his advocacy of age-appropriate sex\neducation for kindergarteners meant putting condoms on cucumbers. That\ndidn’ t work, either. Then John McCain tried calling him a_ “socialist.”\nAlso didn’ t work. Ironically, Socialist Party candidate Norman Thomas ran\nfor president six times, and never won, but every one of his platform\nplanks were eventually adopted by Democrats and _ Republican\nadministrations alike. They just didn’ t ca//it socialism.\n\nIn January 2009, Christian broadcaster Pat Robertson stated that\nGod told him America is headed for veritable socialism as well as an\neconomic rebound under President-elect Obama. “What the Lord was\nsaying,” he claimed, “the people are willing to accept socialism to\nalleviate their pain. Cast off all the gloom and the doom because things\nare getting ready to turn around. | say with humility, | hope |’ ve heard the\nLord. | spend time praying and asking him for wisdom, and if there’ sa\n\nmistake, it’ s not his fault, it’ s mine.” Humility in action.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015318",
