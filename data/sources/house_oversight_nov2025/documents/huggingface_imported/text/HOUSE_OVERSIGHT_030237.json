  "text": "\"Then start by abolishing all income taxes.\"\n\n\"Oh no!\" screamed Mr. Thompson, leaping to his feet. \"We couldn't do that... How would we pay government\nemployees?\"\n\n\"Fire your government employees.\"\n\n\"Oh, no!\"\n\nAbolishing the income tax. Now that really would be a genuine economic stimulus. But Mr. Obama and the\nDemocrats in Washington want to do the opposite: to raise the income tax \"for purposes of fairness\" as Barack\nObama puts it.\n\nDavid Kelley, the president of the Atlas Society, which is dedicated to promoting Rand's ideas, explains that\n\"the older the book gets, the more timely its message.\" He tells me that there are plans to make \"Atlas\nShrugged\" into a major motion picture -- it is the only classic novel of recent decades that was never made into\na movie. \"We don't need to make a movie out of the book,\" Mr. Kelley jokes. \"We are living it right now.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030237",
