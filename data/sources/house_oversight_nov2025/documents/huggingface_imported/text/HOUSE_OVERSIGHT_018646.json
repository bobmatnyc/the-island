  "text": "analyzing personal connections -- I want to do more of that, even when there are\nemotional risks. What's past that emotion? What's under my heart? How much can I feel\nfor another person, and in what ways can I manage that? Which part of my mind will\ncatch me if I end up going over the edge? Will anything?\n\nte OK ok\n\nAnd so, even though I have a good sense of my boundaries, I also occasionally have the\nsense that anything could happen.\n\nThis is not always dramatic. Sometimes it is quite tame, like with my current\npolyamorous leanings. When I was at dinner with my father, he gently expressed concern\nabout how being polyamorous might affect me emotionally. He wasn't trying to tell me\nwhat to do -- just that he’s having trouble understanding where I'm at. \"For me,\" he said,\n\"sexual relationships encourage emotional attachment,” and talked about how he bonds\nwith one person at a time. He added, \"I simply find that if my relationship is truly\nsatisfying, I don't want more than one; I can't convince myself to be interested in more\nthan one partner.”\n\nI used to feel the same way. Dad knows it, and I know it; we've said these things before.\nIt's not like I don't understand how he feels -- I totally do.\n\nAnd there's no guarantee that, over the course of experimenting with polyamory, I won't\nbond with a partner in a way that feels monogamous -- and then get hurt if they won't be\nmonogamous with me. I'm not convinced that I'll feel completely secure as I continue to\npursue polyamory. Recently I had one difficult morning that featured two simultaneous\nbreakups, and that was a bit much to deal with! In short, I'm not certain that polyamory is\nmy ideal. But I'm also no longer certain that it's not. And I'm really enjoying trying it out.\n\nHere's the thing: I'm not sure what I'm thinking... but that's okay. I know I could end up\ngetting hurt... and that's okay. I could get my heart broken: that's what you risk when\nyou experiment with the alchemy of your own emotions, your hormones, your body, your\nself. But I'm watching myself and being careful and communicating as clearly as I\npossibly can, and it seems to be going fine. And if poly really doesn't work out for me, I\ncan go back to monogamy.\n\nAnd hey, at least if I do get my heart broken, it's something else to analyze obsessively\nand then write about! That's something to look forward to.\n\nKK ok\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2010/12/13/slogan-you-dont-always-know-what-youre-\nthinking/\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018646",
