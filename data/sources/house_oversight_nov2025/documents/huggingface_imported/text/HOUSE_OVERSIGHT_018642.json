  "text": "ways to reassure your partner while protecting your own needs and boundaries.\n\nThe most stable relationship formation for dealing with jealousy and competitive urges\nappears to be monogamy. To be sure, I think people have plenty of other reasons for\nchoosing monogamy. But the relationship tool that seems to work most thoroughly, and\nmost often, and for the most people, is simply... being monogamous.\n\nThere are many ways of approaching non-monogamy, but the one I'm most familiar with\nis polyamory. A lot of polyamorists, though not all, organize their relationships into\nhierarchies: they have one or more \"primary relationships,” and then \"secondary\nrelationships\" and other relationships that don't make it to secondary level. Sometimes a\nprimary partner will have \"veto power\" -- 1.¢., if one partner wants to get a new partner,\nthen the primary partner can explicitly block that partner. This seems to help control a lot\nof jealousy and competitive behavior.\n\nSome poly folks say that they see hierarchies and veto power as \"blunt instruments,” and\nthat they prefer to negotiate every interaction case-by-case. This sounds fine to me as\nlong as it works for them, of course. But I would offer this: I think that blunt instruments\nare sometimes the most useful tool for a given project. And in fact, blunt instruments are\nmore often useful than finer-tuned instruments. The whole idea of finer-tuned\ninstruments is that they're useful for precise circumstances... but they're also harder to\nuse, and more fragile. Some people don't have the time or inclination to create a whole\nnew toolkit for every individual relationship. Some people will settle for a slightly less\nprecise, perfect relationship in exchange for a more stable one. Sometimes it's simply\neasier to use a blunter, but more universally effective tool.\n\nI will also add that I have seen plenty of polyamorous relationships in which there were\nunspoken hierarchies, and unspoken veto power. This resulted in maneuvering that\nstruck me as both underhanded and unnecessary. I've always felt that it would be better\nfor everyone involved if those dynamics were put out on the surface.\n\nFinally, for people who like jealousy and competition.... If S&M has taught me anything,\nit's that it's quite possible to play with pain and power within a safe, loving framework.\nThe key is to compartmentalize the whole process and discuss it openly. If people are into\ncompetitive relationships, then okay. If people like jealousy, then okay. But in that case,\nthey really ought to look for partners who share those tastes, and to find ways that they\ncan deal with them openly and honestly.\n\nIn S&M, there's a huge emphasis on careful communication tactics -- safewords are the\nmost famous example, but there are plenty of others. There's also a huge emphasis on\ntalking about the S&M encounter and processing it together afterwards; we call this\naftercare. If jealousy and competitiveness can be understood as consensual games of pain\nand power, then I think people who want to play those games would do well to learn\nabout S&M communication tactics. If you're going to have fun making your partner feel\nan emotion as intense as jealousy, then you might consider giving your partner a\nsafeword.\n\nte ok ok\n\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018642",
