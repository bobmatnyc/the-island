  "text": "21\n\nHome market investment allows for greater\ninternalisation and reduced hedging costs\n\nGiven recent increases in the likelinood of outflows,\nfigure 13 shows how sovereigns are growing their\nfocus on home market allocations to reduce foreign\ncurrency exposure. While home market investment\naligns to greater internalisation, it also grows\ncorrelations between sovereign portfolio performance\nand local economic performance. Since sovereign\nfunding is also heavily dependent on the local market,\nsovereigns are at risk of increasing cashflow strains\n(from both investment returns and new funding) when\nthe local economy underperforms.\n\nSovereigns may need to revert to greater\ngeographic diversification, at the cost of short-\nterm returns\n\nThe combination of continuing home market tilts,\nalong with a concentration in a small number of ‘safe\nhavens’, threatens to squeeze allocations to markets\nthat lack clear growth or stability attributes. As the\ngranularity of geopolitical risk models increases,\nsovereigns are at risk of being overly selective in their\ngeographic investments and becoming dependent\non single markets within geographic regions.\n\nHowever, many of the driving forces behind\nconcentrated geographic allocations are unlikely\nto last. Interest rate disparity in developed markets\nis expected to reduce if European and Japanese\nquantitative tightening begins, suggesting that\nincreased fixed income allocations to the US are\ntactical. Similarly, while growing emerging market\nallocations is a strategic initiative, India has been\ntargeted due to its recent economic growth, relative\nto other major emerging markets.\n\nWhile sovereigns are willing to be overweight\nindividual countries to capture additional returns\n(either through short-term tactical allocations or\ngreater internalisation), they may shift their focus\nback to managing risk across diverse geographic\nallocations, fulfilling their aim to make government\nreserves independent of local economic performance.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026701",
