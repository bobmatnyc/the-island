Sunday.\nHe was released on $3,000 bond.\n\nEpstein’s case is unusual in that\nsuspected prostitution johns are usually\ncharged with a misdemeanor, and.even\na felony charge is typically made in a\ncriminal information — an alternative to\nan indictment charging a person with\n\naE 2\n\nthe commission of a\ncrime. é\nHis attorney, Jack |*\nGoldberger, declined to |\ndiscuss the charge. a\n\nState attorney's of |}\nfice spokesman Mike\nEdmondson also had\nlittle to say.\n\n“Generally speak-\ning, there is a case that\nhas a number of different aspects to it,”\nEdmondson said of a_prostitution-\nrelated charge being submitted to a\ngrand jury. “We first became aware of\nthe case months ago by Palm Beach\npolice.”\n\nProsecutors.and police worked to-\ngether to bring the case to the grand\njury, he said.\n\nPalm Beach police confirmed that\nand said the department will release a\nreport today regarding its investigation.\n\nEpstein has owned a five-bedroom,\n7%-bath, 7,234-square-foot home with a\npool and a boat dock on the Intracoastal\n\nEpstein\n\nWaterway since 1990, according to\nproperty records.
