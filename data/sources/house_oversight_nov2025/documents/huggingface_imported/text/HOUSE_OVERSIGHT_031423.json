Guest Post by Jim Krane: Dubai, Not Obama, is the Mideast's Best\nPeace Hope Tuesday, Sep 01 2009, 3:11PMThis is a guest note by Jim Krane, a former AP Persian Gulf correspondent. His new\nbook on Dubai, City of Gold: Dubai and the Dream of Capitalism, is available.\n\nAs Americans, Israelis and Palestinians continue their endless peace-jockeying, a more hopeful solution has emerged. It is a fresh\nArab initiative that depends neither on America nor Israel.\n\nIt is Dubai.\n\nDubai, you must know, is the flashy Gulf city-state that is one of the seven United Arab Emirates. In my book, I argue that Dubaians,\ndescended from illiterate Bedouin who faced starvation in the 1940s, have authored the most exciting Arab accomplishment in 700\nyears.\n\nFrom nowhere, Dubai has mushroomed into a trading city-state on the lines of Hong Kong and Singapore, with sidelines in real\nestate and tourism.\n\nDubai accomplished all this without (much) oil, and without the help - or even recognition of the United States. While Washington\nhas been caught up prolonging the Israel-Palestinian conflict and starting a war in Iraq, Dubai was erecting one of the world's most\nspectacular cities. So, how can Dubai fix the Middle East? It certainly can't do much to help Palestinians suffering under Israeli\nmisrule.\n\nBut that is the point. Dubai has succeeded in spite of the plight of the Palestinians, and in spite of what Arab leaders describe as US\nmeddling that stymies their development. One of the favorite themes of Dubai leader Sheikh Mohammed 1s that his counterparts\nshould stop bloviating about the Israelis and start serving the interests of their own citizens.\n\nDubai's wild growth backs up Sheikh Mohammed's message. His business-before-politics way is becoming a development model for\nthe rest of the Arab world.\n\nBut wait, Dubai is in financial trouble. How could it be a role model?Dubai's downturn is temporary. Being one of the world's most\nglobalized cities, it couldn't help but be infected by a global recession. The contagion kneecapped each one of its economic pillars:\nShipping, logistics, tourism, and its binging real estate sector. Most of these pillars remain sound.\n\nDubai's economic example isn't widely understood in Washington. But it's a good thing. Emulating Dubai could make Arab countries\nmore stable and secure, along with the rest of us. For America, which has mistreated Dubai despite synergies with our interests, it's a\nwindfall.\n\nIf you remember, Dubai in 2006 bought US port operations and found itself vilified as a terrorist logistics center. Members of\n\nCongress now in the Obama administration -- among them the senator who is now president -- jotned the Dubai-bashing. Well, it\nmay turn out that this \"terrorist logistics center\" has one of the keys for fixing the Mideast's terrorism problem.\n\nThe Dubai model is a mixture of social freedom, unbridled immigration, and raw capitalism. It is overseen by a government that is\none of the world's least democratic. This is no accident. Dubai avoids both elections and the Arab obsession with politics, especially\nthe syndrome of feeling slighted by the West.\n\nDubai is pragmatic. It makes money doing business with Israel and Iran, countries shunned by other Arab states. The city's finessing\nof simultaneous friendships with Washington and Tehran is as deft as it is precarious.\n\nDubai's government wrings efficiencies using schemes from Harvard Business School and General Electric. Its use of strategic\nplanning is a new concept in the Middle East. Dubai conceives developments, like no-tax business parks, and builds them exactly as\npromised.\n\nIn contrast with the surrounding police states, Dubai functions on the honor system. Alcohol is legal. Prostitution is tolerated. A nice\nexample is the e-Gate scheme, which allows residents to use a biometric card to skip passport control. None of the neighbors has the\nconfidence to replace state security with a smart card. Not Saudi Arabia, not Iran, not Israel.\n\nSaudis and Iranians, especially, find a refreshing dignity in Dubai, a respect for their ability to make the right choice. \"Friday you can\npray, but Thursday night you might want to go to the bar,\" says a Dubai-based Saudi. \"It's up to you.\"Dubai is certainly taking risks.\nBut rulers from Morocco to Iran are already Xeroxing parts of the Dubai playbook and waiting to see how the more controversial\napproaches pan out. For some, it's a matter of self-preservation: Dubai's state-led development doesn't involve elections. For others\nit's a bid to stop the hemorrhage of bright citizens and cash fleeing to Dubai.\n\nAll of them ought to do more. Egypt, with its unemployed masses, could make use of Dubai's incentives for foreign investment.\n\nSyria might adopt its free trade ways. Iraq and Israel could use a dose of its religious tolerance. And its Gulf neighbors might\nstreamline their bureaucracies as Dubai has.\n\nOf course, there are areas where neighbors emulate Dubai to their detriment. Dubai's abusive \"in-sourced\" labor market is one. Real\nestate is another. One hopes Dubai's property crash taught admirers what not to copy. And Dubai pays no heed to the environment.\nThus Dubaians, with their monster 4x4s and chilled swimming pools, are the world's most prolific polluters.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031423",
