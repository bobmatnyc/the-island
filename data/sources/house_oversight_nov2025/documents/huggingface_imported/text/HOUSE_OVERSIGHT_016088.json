  "text": "398 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\naround quantum mechanics, relativity and cosmology, Robert Winston's\nBad Ideas for a more thorough history of language and writing, and The\nTrouble with Physics for the recent history of particle Physics. Regarding\nthe brain, anything by Oliver Sachs is a winner. Your Brain on Music is a\ngood primer on the theory of artistic thought and music, and Proust and\nthe Squid is a good discussion of dyslexia and learning.\n\nThe digits for the sequence of the Smallpox virus in Chapter Eight\ncome from the varicella-zoster virus, a similar pathogen. The first few\nletters could be the same, but I hope it is impossible for anyone to\ndisprove this as you would have to break into the CDC to do so.\n\nJohn Masters is not the real name of the US officer who spoke in\nKabul. That name was never released to the press.\n\nThis book was originally written using Microsoft Word ona MacBook\nPro. It was then typeset for print using a variety of ePublication tools,\nincluding iBooksAuthor and Adobe InDesign. You can find a website for\nthe book at wwwjamestagg.com. It is published using WordPress. All\nthe links in the book should be maintained there just in case there is link\natrophy for the printed version of the book. Feel free to comment using\nthe blog, Twitter, Facebook or email me.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016088",
