It’s disproven, but keeps coming back, most recently with Big\nData illusions.\n\nA child doesn’t grow arms and legs rather than wings, or a mammalian vs insect visual system, the way an ant\nsearches for food. Rather, the path of development is sharply restricted (and evolution follows constraints\ntoo). Acquisition of language (and other cognitive achievements) seems very much like physical growth.\n\nHighly contentious in the field, but in my opinion that’s a comment on the failures of the field.\n\nFrom: jeffrey E.
