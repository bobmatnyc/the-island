I am\na fair person,’ Caproni said. “I want\nto listen to what they have to say. It\nseems as though they’re going to put\ntogether an offer.”\n\nCaproni had told The Daily News\non Monday he was announcing a\nwork stoppage beginning Wednesday.\nHe said he and other haulers were go-\ning to stop emptying scores of bins\nacross St. Thomas and St. John be-\ncause Waste Management had failed\nto pay them for weeks or months.\n\nCaproni said he has worked 26\nyears in trash removal and roll on/\n\nroll off services in the territory. He\nsaid his company empties “all the\nrear load bins on St. John,’ and does\nemergency Waste Management Au-\nthority work on St. Thomas.\n\nContacted by The Daily News,\nWaste Management Authority execu-\ntives were unaware Caproni and pos-\nsibly two other haulers were walking\noff the job.\n\nRoger Merritt Jr., the newly hired\nexecutive director of the agency, said\nMonday evening he wants to meet\nwith all the contracted haulers to see\nwhat they are owed and come up with\na plan to get them paid.\n\n“T understand that the haulers need\nto get paid,” Merritt said. “We need\nto ensure we are able to make timely\npayments.”\n\nCaproni said he is willing to lis-\nten, but the answer has to be that the\nWaste Management Authority comes\nup with payment for services already\nrendered.\n\n“The solution is, you pay your bills\non time,” he said.\n\nPatrick Charles, one of the vendors\nCaproni mentioned, said Monday that\nhe has “reasons to be on board” with\na work stoppage, though he couldn’t\nmake such a decision alone.\n\n“T realize that he is upset,’ Charles\nsaid, referring to Caproni. “It is time\n\nPolice: Ex-employee filing\n\nBy BRIAN O’CONNOR\nDaily News Staff\n\nPolice officials dismissed this week\nmultiple complaints filed by a former\nemployee against high-ranking mem-\nbers of the V.I. Police Department.\n\nThe complaints are all filed by\nLynne Harrison, the former director\nof the Police Training Bureau.\n\nIn one such complaint, Harrison\nalleges Deputy Commissioner Curtis\nGriffin Jr. was “receiving compensa-\ntion when absence from employment\nwithout proper leave documentation,”\nand “payroll fraud/embezzlement\n— falsifying timekeeping records,\nor when employees are not working\nwhile on the job.”\n\nIn a letter attached to the claim,\nHarrison says that from August 2016\nto the present, Griffin received com-\npensation while not reporting for\nduty at the department.\n\n“In addition, he has not left for-\nwarding contact information to those\nunder his supervision and often was\nnot available during contact attempts\noccurring during normal working\nhours,” Harrison wrote. “Griffin was\navailable only via VIPD email which\nwas delayed or not deliverable, thus\nleaving him ineffective and not suit-\nable to be classified as working tele-\ncommuting.”\n\nGriffin dismissed the complaints\n\nagainst him, and said he welcomed\nan investigation.\n\n“IT want them to investigate be-\ncause I’m hoping — when all is done\n— I’m hoping that maybe I can sue\nher for slander,” he said. “I have noth-\ning to hide.”\n\nHarrison’s letter calls for Griffin to\nbe investigated.\n\n“While his explanation of absence\nhas been reported as a long term med-\nical procedure, due to the extraordi-\nnary length of absence, previous ab-\nsences, and non-contact information,\na full investigation is warranted to in-\nsure the people of the Virgin Islands\nhave not been deprived of its funds\ndue to improper payroll deductions\nor notifications,” she wrote.\n\nThe complaint was one of 10 filed\nafter Harrison lost her job as direc-\ntor of the police department’s Train-\ning Bureau, according to copies fur-\nnished by Harrison.\n\nShe filed a citizen’s complaint after\nher termination alleging that Police\nCommissioner Delroy Richards Sr.\nhad violated department policy and\nthat he had ignored requests for the\ncorrection of a violation.\n\nHarrison also filed a complaint\nalleging Griffin’s administrative as-\nsistant, Le-Reeda Lake, was absent\non sick leave for four weeks without\nprior notice; that special assistant to\nthe commissioner Capt. Mary Dug-\n\n66\n\nThe solution is, you pay your bills on time.\n\n— Peter Caproni, owner of Your Environmental Services Inc.\n\nfor anybody to get upset. I’m in\nagreement with him.”\n\nCharles said his firm empties bins\non St. Thomas and hauls trash from\nWaste Management Authority collec-\ntion sites in a number of government\nhousing communities.\n\nRegarding how much Waste Man-\nagement owes him, Charles replied:\n“It depends on what you call a lot.\nThey’re two months behind, now.”\n\nCaproni wouldn’t say how\nmuch Waste Management owes\nhim in total.\n\n“It’s a big amount of money,” he\nsaid. “I’m fed up with the whole\nthing.”\n\nCaproni said he estimated that\nWaste Management owes various\nvendors millions of dollars.\n\nThe Waste Management Author-\nity’s inability to pay vendors has been\na topic during Senate testimony over\nthe years.\n\nSteve Aubin, who was interim ex-\necutive director of the Waste Man-\nagement Authority for most of 2016,\n\ntold the Senate Finance Committee in\nJuly that the contractors needed to be\npaid.\n\n“Tt is clear that the contractors\nare bearing the brunt while trying to\nprovide critical services in hopes of\npayment by the authority as soon as\npossible,” he said.\n\nAubin ran the agency after the re-\ntirement of May Adams Cornwall un-\ntil Merritt was hired last month.\n\n“The financial condition of the\nVirgin Islands Waste Management\nAuthority is dire and requires im-\nmediate attention and relief,’ Aubin\ntold senators in July. “The author-\nity’s available cash to pay its con-\ntractors/vendors timely is critically\nlimited, resulting in delayed pay-\nments to its contractors/vendors;\ngrowing accounts payable, which\nis currently on the order of $10\nmillion for its major contractors/\nvendors; and non-compliance at the\nAnguilla and Bovoni landfills with\ncourt ordered mandates.”\n\nAn example of the outstanding\n\nobligations owed by Waste Manage-\nment has been highlighted for the\nlast two years in Senate testimony\nduring the budget process. For Fiscal\nYear 2016, the agency noted it owed\nvendor Gem’s Construction $200,000\nfrom fiscal year 2012 to pay for gar-\nbage collection services on the island\nof St. Thomas.\n\nThe Waste Management Authority\nnoted that it was “unable to identify a\nrevenue source” to pay Gem’s for the\nyears-old debt.\n\nDuring testimony on the Fiscal\nYear 2017 budget, Waste Manage-\nment again listed $200,000 owed\nto Gem’s Construction for garbage\ncollection on St. Thomas. However,\nWaste Management officials said the\n$200,000 was owed from the 2011\nfiscal year.\n\nNo one from Gem’s Construction\nwas available for comment Monday\nafternoon.\n\nMerritt said he believes the Waste\nManagement Authority can address\nthe overdue debt owed to the vendors.\n\n“T think we can. We’ve got to get\na plan in hand and get them paid. If\nthey provide a service, they should\nget paid,” he said.\n\n— Contact Jonathan Austin at\n340-714-9104 or email jaustin@\ndailynews.vi.\n\n‘frivolous’ complaints against top cops\n\ngan had potentially disclosed confi-\ndential department information to a\nthird-party vendor for personal gain,\nand had used threatening behavior to\ncreate a hostile work environment,\nand that she had obstructed Harri-\nson’s performance of her duties.\n\nHarrison further alleged that Lt.\nMaria Colon-Jones had disrupted a\ntraining presentation, and she said\nher termination was retaliatory for\nasking for sick leave to be treated for\nZika.\n\nHarrison said that she eventually\nfled the Virgin Islands in fear of her\nlife and that the police department\nstill owes her $5,000 in back pay,\nHarrison said.\n\nHarrison said Monday she’s sub-\nmitted her complaints to Gov. Ken-\nneth Mapp.\n\n“T was the director of training and\nwas fired without cause,” she said. “I\nhad filed several complaints.”\n\nHarrison said she requested 10 days\nof medical treatment off-island to com-\nbat a Zika infection on Oct. 18.\n\n“Two hours later, I was terminat-\ned,” she said.\n\nDocuments provided by Harrison\nshow she was suspended without pay\non Oct. 18, and terminated on Oct.\n28.\n\nGriffin said that while he was un-\ndergoing cardio rehab in Florida, he\nstarted hearing about issues involving\n\nHarrison. Ultimately, Richards made\nthe decision to terminate Harrison,\nGriffin said.\n\n“Subsequent to her termination,\nshe started sending complaints,” he\nsaid. “She said she heard that while\nI was away I was practicing law and\nnot really sick.”\n\nHarrison wasn’t his supervisor,\nand wasn’t aware of how the accumu-\nlated sick time was being used, Grif-\nfin said.\n\n“She submitted so many com-\nplaints against so many people,” he\nsaid. “It’s obvious that it’s frivolous.”\n\nThe complaints have not yet re-\nsulted in an internal investigation,\nRichards said.\n\n“T found she was too much of a\ndistraction for us to move forward\nwith the actions as required of us by\nthe mandates of our consent decree,”\nRichards said about his decision to\nterminate Harrison.\n\nHarrison had failed to submit to a\ndepartment background check in a\ntimely manner, Richards said.\n\n“The department brought her in\non an interim basis initially, and then\nshe was asked to comply with the\npackage that we provided in order to\nconduct a background investigation,”\nhe said. “She offered resistance. She\nbelieved she could complete her own\ntimeline.”\n\nHarrison said she had asked for 10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014500\n\ndays to secure her college transcripts.\n\n“My email specifically says I am\nnot saying I don’t want a background\ncheck,” she said.\n\nRichards said he ultimately direct-\ned Harrison’s complaints to the legal\ndepartment, but he said Harrison\ncontinued to send letters and emails.\n\nA response from the department’s\nlegal counsel provided by Harrison\nsays simply that Harrison couldn’t\nuse the citizen’s complaint process to\ncomplain about things that happened\nwhile she was the director of the\nTraining Bureau, and that each com-\nplaint will be closed as it is received.\n\n“Tn some of her letters and emails,\nshe appeared very threatening,”\nRichards said. “In one of her emails\nshe wrote ‘You are sicker than a tree\nbranch that’s going to be cut down\nvery soon.’ It’s one ignorance after\nanother.”\n\nHarrison disputes that charac-\nterization.\n\n“I’m very professional,” she said.\n\nGriffin was on legitimate sick leave\nwhen he was in Florida, Richards\nsaid.\n\n“He was being treated and he en-\ntered into a program in Florida,” he\nsaid. “The woman is on a witch hunt\nall over.”\n\n— Contact Brian O’Connor at\n340-714-9130 or email boconnor@\ndailynews.vi.",
