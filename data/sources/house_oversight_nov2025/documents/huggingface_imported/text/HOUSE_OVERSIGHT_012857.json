  "text": "lam God!\n\nAcross the globe, in Eastern and Western cultures, clinicians have reported a consistent pattern of\npsychotic delusion, typically associated with schizophrenia: many believe that they are God, God’s\nmessenger, or the Devil, equipped with extraordinary, invincible powers. This is the same disorder that\nled the Australian gentleman we encountered at the start of this chapter to believe that he had two heads\nand heard the voices of Jesus and Abraham. Estimates reveal a greater number of cases among Catholic\nthan Islamic or Protestant societies, and the fewest among Hindu societies, although experts are uncertain\nas to why such particular biases exist. The interesting point 1s that there are individual differences in the\nexpression of religious delusions that are at least partially mediated by the particular beliefs and customs\nof the religion. Religious delusions are also held with greater conviction than other delusions, more\nresistant to change, and often result in self-mutilation or harming others; when harm occurs, it follows\nthe narrative from a religious text, plucking out eyes or cutting off genitals as the means to cleansing\nsins.\n\nWhat makes religious delusions like these, in which the individual has created a narrative of\nsupreme confidence and power, different from non-delusional, non-psychotic forms of distortion? In a\nGallup poll, 10% of the Americans surveyed claimed they had spoken with the devil. In several\npsychological experiments, healthy non-psychotic subjects consistently report that they are smarter than\nmost, more attractive, and more likely to win than lose an athletic competition. Though some of these\npeople are correct — they are in fact smarter, more attractive, and better competitors — most are wrong\nand yet believe they are right. What this research reveals is that we all suffer, some more than others,\nfrom positive illusions — biases that distort our sense of confidence, control, and invincibility These\nillusions differ from delusions in that they are less fixed, more flexible, and more amenable to change.\nDelusions are highly maladaptive, a signature of brain dysfunction, and the source of great suffering.\nPositive illusions, in contrast, are often highly adaptive, generating the confidence necessary to take on\ngreat challenges and challengers, convincing an audience or a group of opponents that we are stronger,\nsmarter, and sexier. Positive illusions have been linked to direct mental and physical health benefits,\nincluding evidence that distorted optimism can slow disease progression. Positive illusions are, as noted\nby the biologists Richard Wrangham, Robert Trivers, and Dominic Johnson, a form of self-deception with\nconsiderable evolutionary benefits. But like the runaway capacity of desire, so too can our illusions of\ngrandeur runaway. When this occurs, illusion and delusion are virtually indistinguishable. What was\nonce a narrative centered on the grandiose belief of being god-like has been transformed into the belief of\n\nbeing God, leading individuals and groups to engage in extreme extortion or violence, not only blind to\n\nHauser Chapter 3.
