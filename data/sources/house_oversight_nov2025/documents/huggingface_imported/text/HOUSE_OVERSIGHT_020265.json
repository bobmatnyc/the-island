(After finally leaving Snowden in Moscow on\nNovember 3, 2013, Harrison moved to Berlin, where she set up an organization to provide, as she\ntermed it, “an underground railroad” for other fugitives who have provided documents exposing\ngovernment secrets.)\n\nSnowden meanwhile received sanctuary in Russia. His public statements in Hong Kong that\nhe was willing to go prison so that others could live freely in a democratic society were, as it\nturned out, mere rhetoric. Instead of risking prison, he had successfully escaped to a country in\nwhich he would be treated as a hero for defying the US government. He had not sacrificed\nhimself, he had transformed himself. He had risen from being a lowly technician in Hawaii whose\ntalents went largely unrecognized, to the status of an international media star in Moscow. In his\nnew messianic role, he could make Internet appearances via Skype to prestigious gathering such\nas the TED conference where he would be roundly applauded as an Internet hero. He could be\nbeamed into dozens of ACLU meetings where he would be celebrated as a defender of American\nliberty. He could describe to sympathetic audiences in Germany, Norway and France the\nunfairness of the American legal system, asserting that it was denting him a “far trial.” He could\nnow make front page news by granting interview to the New York Times, Washington Post,\nNation and other elite newspapers. He could join Poitras and Greenwald on the Board of\nDirectors of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. He could be the subject of both an Oscar-\nwinning documentary, the hero of the 2016 Hollywood movie “Snowden.” directed by Oliver\nStone and a consultant to the 2015 season of the television series “Homeland.” He could also be\nnominated for the Nobel Peace Prize in 2014. His could also attract over one-half million\nfollowers to his tweets on Twitter in 2015. “For me, in terms of personal satisfaction, the\nmission’s already accomplished. I already won,” he informed the Washington Post in his first live\ninterview in Moscow. It was a mission that involved a very high stakes enterprise: taking\nAmerica’s state secrets abroad.\n\nHow he managed to succeed in this extraordinary undertaking is another story and one which\nmay not lend itself to an innocent explanation. Whistle-blowers do not ordinarily steal military\nsecrets. Nor do they flee to the territory of America’s principle adversaries. A fugitive, especially\none lacking a Russian visa, does not wind up in Moscow by pure accident. A Russian President,\nespecially one with the KGB background of Putin, does not lightly give his personal sanction to a\nhigh-profile exfiltration from Hong Kong without weighing the gain that might proceed from it.\nPart of that calculus would be that the defector had taken possession of a great number of\nclassified documents from the inner sanctum of the NSA. To be sure, the practical value of this\nstolen archive would require a lengthily evaluation by its intelligence services. Finally, a defector\nwho put himself in the palm of the hand of the FSB in Moscow would be expected to cooperate\nwith it. Even if such a defector did not carry these files with him to Moscow, intelligence services\nhave the means to recover digital files, even if after they are erased from a computer or if they are\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020265",
