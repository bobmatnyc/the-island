And they were girls\n\nBy Elisa Cramer\n\nHASH(0x5fa474)\n\nFriday, August 04, 2006\n\nIf the women whom Palm Beach police say a part-time town resident invited to his home\nand paid for sex acts were, in fact, women, the solicitation charge against Jeffrey Epstein\nmight feel more sufficient. But, according to police records, they weren't. He was over\n\n50. And they were girls. 14. 15.16.17-year-old girls. That should count for something -\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030299",
