Observer”, “Physics of Consciousness”, “Quantum Cosmology of the Beginning?”, Philosophy of
Cosmology"); progressing on “Sleep & Dreams”.

In LA for 2 weeks, then back to China; NY in January. You there then?
Love to get your sense of Trump’s administration, policies.

Didn’t know. Meaning of the rest note?

Mahler’s 5th opens with the same rhythmic motif (but 4th note is the same as the first three, not lower as in
Beethoven’s) - Mahler’s Sth is my favorite symphony.

note ( you can verify, bu looking at the score ), isarestnote(silent) so 0-555-3
