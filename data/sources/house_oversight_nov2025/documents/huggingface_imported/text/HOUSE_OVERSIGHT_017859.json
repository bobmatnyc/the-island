  "text": "794\n\ncourt shall decline to hear a claim under\nthis paragraph\n(A) if the foreign state was not desig-\nnated as a state sponsor of terrorism\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(7) (emphasis added).\nThe parties agree that the Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia has not been designated a\nstate sponsor of terrorism. See 28 U.S.C.\n§ 1605(a)(7)(A) (explaining there is no ju-\nrisdiction if “the foreign state was not\ndesignated as a state sponsor of terrorism\nunder ... the Export Administration Act\nof 1979 ... or ... the Foreign Assistance\nAct of 1961”). Thus, this exception does\nnot provide an exception to immunity for\nany of the Defendants raising the FSIA\ndefense here.\n\n3. Torts Exception\n\nIn relevant part, the torts exception de-\nprives a foreign sovereign of immunity in\nactions:\n\nin which money damages are sought\n\nagainst a foreign state for personal inju-\n\nry or death, or damage to or loss of\nproperty, occurring in the United States\nand caused by the tortious act or omis-\nsion of that foreign state or of any offi-\ncial or employee of that foreign state\nwhile acting within the scope of his of-\nfice or employment; except this [excep-\ntion] shall not apply to -\n(A) any claim based upon the exercise\nor performance or the failure to exer-\ncise or perform a discretionary func-\ntion regardless of whether the discre-\ntion be abused.\n\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5). Second Circuit\nlaw instructs that district courts must de-\ntermine whether the defendant’s alleged\nacts were tortious under the laws of New\nYork and, if so, whether the defendant’s\nacts were discretionary. Robinson, 269\nF.3d at 142 (If those activities could not\nrender the Malaysian government liable\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nfor a tort under New York law, then it\nremained immune under § 1605(a)(5).”).\nIn the event that the act is tortious and\nthe acts were not discretionary, the alleged\ntortfeasor is subject to suit under the\nFSIA.\n\n[19] The FSIA’s discretionary function\nexception replicates the discretionary func-\ntion exception found in the Federal Tort\nClaims Act. See 28 U.S.C. § 2680(a).\nCourts have found both exceptions are “in-\ntended to preserve immunity for ‘decisions\ngrounded in social, economic, and political\npolicy”” Marchisella v. Gov't of Japan,\nNo. 02 Civ. 100238(DC), 2004 WL 307248, at\n*2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 17, 2004) (citing United\nStates v. S.A. Empresa de Viacao Aerea\nRio Grandense (Varig Airlines), 467 U.S.\n797, 814, 104 S.Ct. 2755, 81 L.Ed.2d 660\n(1984) (interpreting FTCA)). Generally,\nacts are discretionary if they are per-\nformed at the planning level of govern-\nment, as opposed to the operational level.\nKline v. Kaneko, 685 F.Supp. 386, 392\n(S.D.N.Y.1988) (finding decision to expel\nplaintiff from Mexico was product of en-\nforcement of immigration laws and there-\nfore a discretionary function); Marchisel-\nla, 2004 WL 307248, at *2 (finding decision\nregarding placement of a water hose on a\nship was an operational function and there-\nfore not discretionary and not protected by\nthe FSIA); Napolitano v. Tishman\nConstr. Corp., No. 96 Civ. 4402(SJ), 1998\nWL 102789, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb. 26, 1998)\n(finding purchasing consulate buildings\nand hiring contractor to renovate is a plan-\nning function and therefore discretionary).\n\nDefendants argue that the Court should\nnot even consider the torts exception for\ntwo reasons. First, they claim that for\nthis exception to apply, the entire tort\nmust have occurred in the United States,\nwhich Defendants argue is not the case\nhere. Second, Defendants claim that\nPlaintiffs impermissibly seek to contort a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017859",
