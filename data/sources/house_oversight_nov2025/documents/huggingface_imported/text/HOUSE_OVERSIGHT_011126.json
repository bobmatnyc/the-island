  "text": "That leaves economics. Here | really have a one-man pantheon in Sir William Petty. |\nsuppose that! am the only person to have looked at his portrait alongside Isaac\nNewton’s, in the Royal Society which they co-founded, and seen the two as\nintellectual equals. Mill seems a clear second, thanks to his superb paragraph on\ngrowth. The candidates for third seem well behind. Maybe Jevons or John Rae or\nLeon Walras. Time has not been kind to the teachings of Keynes. I would now rank\nhis teacher Alfred Marshall higher. I like Myrdal’s magnificent ex ante - ex post\ndistinction. Boehm Bawerk and the Austrian school are underrated. The pantheon\n\nmight have room for him.\n\nAm I being too tough on later economists? We should not forget Schultz and Ben-\nPorath. Schultz’ greatest achievement, unless Mincer beat him, was in spotlighting\nhuman depreciation. That left me to ask where this huge flow goes. The answer\nbecomes inescapable once we focus on the question. It gives the obvious solution to\nthe age-wage problem. Everything in this book is obvious. Some of it, like that\n\nsolution, is the obvious but unnoticed.\n\nSomebody, sooner or later, breaks the news about the emperor’s new clothes. You’d\nthink Don Quixote would be the last to pipe up. No one in the world was more\ndevoted to tradition and beautiful creatures of the mind. But it takes a fool. He was\nthat, and so am I. Der reine tor. There have to be a few of us always. We'll get a few\n\nwindmills before they they get us.\n\nChapter 10: Three Pantheons 2/10/16 4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011126",
