Some retracement in the market trends we've seen since \nNovember 8 makes sense, in light of the magnitudes of the moves as well as \nthe upcoming event risks (Italian referendum, OPEC meeting, and the \nFOMC meeting). But I think none of these events will likely surprise the \nmarkets, and President-Elect Trump will likely continue to drive the \nmarkets, extending the recent trends. By the way, he has left the US \nTreasury Secretary post last to be filled, and it is the most important \nappointment for the markets as it will both reflect and influence key policies \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026637 \non trade, tax cuts, and infrastructure spending. (1) The doves at the Fed \nhave been silenced as, under President Trump, the US policy mix will likely \nbe less lop-sided and the emphasis will be on Arrow 3, with Arrow 1 being \ndowngraded. I think the effective demotion of the Fed has just begun. Its \nindependence will likely be challenged, as it should be, in my personal \nview. November 8 marked the beginning of the end of the financial \nrepression in the US. (2) Generating outsized economic growth will be key \nto settling several important inconsistencies in macro. I will elaborate on \nthis point below. But the market trends witnessed since November 8 will \nnot be sustained unless Mr Trump's policies indeed lead to significantly \nhigher nominal GDP growth. (3) The mainstream media remain negative on \nMr Trump, but this will keep the hurdle low, and in turn pressure President \nTrump to deliver early in 2017 and thus for him to impress favourably. A \nshift away from identity politics, in my view, based on my personal \nexperience from Taiwan, should lead to positive economic \nprogress. Investors won't need to wait long for there to be more concrete \nannouncements on the various parts of Arrow 3, including both the content \nof the policies as well as their sequencing. (4) FWIW, my two policy \nrecommendations to the reformers are (i) design an effective global taxation \nscheme to properly tax multi-national corporations and (ii) adopt industrial \npolicies to help countries focus on their comparative advantages. The US, \nUK, Japan, and Italy are all prime candidates to do (ii). (5) The dollar is \nalready moderately over-valued, but this will not prevent it from \nstrengthening further, especially against the EM currencies. Think in terms \nof 'growth alpha' and 'growth beta.' Much of EM, including China since \nFebruary of this year, have not possessed 'growth alpha' and have continued \nto rely on 'growth beta' vis-à-vis the rest of the world. I struggle to think of \nkey reforms that EM countries have embarked on in recent years: even \ncountries like France and Italy have undertaken more reforms than most EM \ncountries. Squeezed by (i) a more hawkish Fed, (ii) a China that will \ncontinue to soft land, and (iii) a potentially more inward-looking US, EM \nwill struggle without 'growth alpha.' I think we may be entering into a \nperiod of differentiation among the EM markets: those that have 'growth \nalpha' will be rewarded while those that continue to rely on 'growth beta' \nwill not. (6) The world according to Trump will be more Darwinian for \ncountries and less Darwinian for US citizens.This notion applies to investing \nin EM, to countries' growth prospects, and to international competition — \n(potentially) very different from the last few years, when 'the Fed was the \nonly game in town' and everyone and everything floated higher by central \nbank liquidity... In any case, the dollar should be in a good position to \nthrive, I think. \nEconomic Olympics. The markets are no longer driven only by the Fed and \ncentral bank policies, but by forward-looking policy inclinations. The 'false \neconomy' that central banks have nurtured will gradually be replaced by real \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026638 \neconomies. In my view, Mr Trump's victory will have many social, \ngeopolitical, and economic consequences, but for investors I think he will \nstart a period of 'Economic Olympics', whereby the federal governments \naround the world will take more responsibility and be more proactive to help \ntheir 'national teams' to become more competitive in this globalised \nworld. (1) Free trade is in theory good for economic growth. But there are \nother policies (such as well-directed R&D, efficient investment, an effective \neducational system) that are also extremely important for long-term growth, \nbut have been ignored in the past 15 years because of the globalisation \nfad. A slowdown in trade globalisation might not be bad for the global \neconomy, if policy makers replace this engine of growth with other \nstructural improvements. But while globalisation is more about 'growth \nbeta', other types of structural reforms are about 'growth alpha' and \nfederal/central governments around the world will need to make a greater \neffort at leading the economies to prevent them from falling behind. This is \nlike a government-led program to win Olympic medals, without doping by \ncentral banks. (2) A client kindly brought to my attention an interesting \nreport done by the Harvard Business School that touches on the idea \nmentioned above (Problems Unsolved and a Nation Divided: the State of \nUS Competitiveness 2016'). In it, several sensible and consequential points \nwere made: 'The pressing need for a national economic strategy... Given \nthe significant challenges facing the American economy, the U.S. needs a \nnational economic strategy more than at any other time in recent history. A \nstrategy is an integrated set of priorities that builds on strengths while \nacknowledging and tackling weaknesses... The U.S. lacks an economic \nstrategy, especially at the federal level. The implicit strategy has been to \ntrust the Federal Reserve to solve our problems through monetary \npolicy... A national economic strategy for the U.S. will require action by \nbusiness, state and local governments, and the federal government. All \nthree levels have a crucial role to play in restoring competitiveness... Taking \nleadership in improving U.S. competitiveness is a pressing imperative for \nbusiness leaders. _Many companies have failed to invest enough in \nimproving the business environments in the regions in which they \noperate...' This report from the HBS also reiterates some recommendations \nthey made in 2012: `[Our] Eight-Point Plan consists of the following policy \nrecommendations: simplift the corporate tax code with lower statutory rates \nand no loopholes; move to a territorial tax system like all other leading \nnations '; ease the immigration of highly-skilled individuals; aggressively \naddress distortions and abuses in the international trading system; improve \nlogistics, communications, and energy infrastructure; simplift and \nstreamline regulation; create a sustainable federal budget, including reform \nof entitlements; and responsibly develop America's unconventional energy \nadvantage.' Interestingly, Mr Trump has discussed many of the same \npoints. I personally think that, so far, identity politics has distracted from his \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026639 \nmessage on economic reform. It is likely, I believe, that the focus of the \ngeneral public will be moved to these critical economic reforms. (3) I repeat \na point I've made in the past, that because the mainstream media and most \nscholars are still so skeptical of Mr Trump's policies, the hurdle for him to \nclear and impress positively is very low. Ironically, such general hostility \nwill probably work in favour of the Trump Administration. 5 days after the \nsurprise election victory, the press declared that Mr Trump's transition plan \nwas in hopeless disarray, only for Mr Trump to announce one cabinet \nappointment every day — ahead of the schedule of Presidents Obama and Bill \nClinton when they got elected. (4) We will likely see a less radical President \nTrump. We have already seen this on various issues (the Wall, prosecuting \nMs Clinton), and my guess is that the trade policy will be more restrictive, \nbut the changes will be nuanced at the same time. The appointment of the \nnext Treasury Secretary will convey an important message. (5) I personally \nthink that various countries will likely adopt industrial policies, as a \nsubstitute for slower trade globalization. Already, the UK's PM May \nannounced an ambitious industrial strategy, with a focus on technology. The \ngovernment is committed to investing in R&D through the Industrial \nStrategy Challenge Fund. Regular readers of our work should also know \nthat that is what I would recommend for Japan to consider. I just came back \nfrom a trip to Singapore, and understand that the government there is also \nstruggling to find the best strategy to deal with the next phase of economic \ndevelopment, now that the growth model based on trade and finance may be \ncoming to an end. I think the US should also contemplate its own industrial \npolicy. The title of this section is 'economic Olympics' to convey the notion \nthat the world is in competition, not just along the axes of cheapness of \nlabour and technology. There are different disciplines (analogous to the \nvarious sports in Olympics) in which any country can excel, if the efforts are \nappropriately focused. Instead of being mediocre in many events, countries \nshould seek to win the gold medal in their best events... \n5%-plus nominal GDP growth in the US in 2017? There are several \ninconsistencies in the market trends: (1) a strong dollar and strong US \nequities; (2) protectionism and a strong dollar (Mexico, for example, has \ngotten 10% cheaper so far this month, and China is also cheaper. The \ngreater the threats of protectionism against these countries, the cheaper are \ntheir costs of production...); (3) higher yields and strong equities; (4) Mr \nTrump does not like Chair Yellen or the Fed but he still needs and prefers \nlow interest rates. The only variable that can address these inconsistencies is \n3-4% real economic growth and 5%-plus nominal GDP growth in the \nUS. While it is unlikely that 5% nominal GDP growth is sustained over \ntime, the atmospherics will stop the talk about `r-star' and help support \ninterest rates in the US. 2017 may very well see 5%-plus nominal GDP \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026640 \ngrowth, and, in the event, the 10Y UST yield at 2.34% would not seem too \nhigh. \nThe dollar will continue to smile. Previously, we made the suggestion that \nthe US dollar is on the right side of the Dollar Smile against the majors, but \nit is on the left side of the Dollar Smile against the EM \ncurrencies. Reaganomics-Lite should be positive for the dollar, even if the \nUS' twin deficits could widen. 'America First' means that there will be a \nbifurcation in economic prosperity, that economic strength in the US will no \nlonger translate, with the same elasticities as before, into prosperity in many \nparts of EM. (1) The dollar has begun a consolidation phase this week. But \nmy guess is that it will be temporary and shallow, partly because the data \n(ISM and NFPRs) will be sufficiently strong to justify another Fed rate hike \non December 14. The weekly claims data remain extraordinarily strong, \nwhile the second derivatives in the data in much of EM have ceased to be \npositive. (2) Further advances in the dollar, however, will of course depend \non the policy announcements and delivery by the Trump Administration, as \nwell as an apparent lack of an economic strategy in other countries. (3) \nYield differentials have helped the dollar advance vis-à-vis the JPY and the \nEUR. However, I should note that the EMU economies are not doing that \nbadly, though credit demand remains weak. PMI remains well above 50 and \ninflation has bounced away from zero. The main factor — other than yield \ndifferentials - weighing on the EUR is the risk that we will see more political \nuncertainty in Europe. (4) I came across an editorial arguing that Mr \nTrump's protectionist policies would hurt the dollar's international \nstanding. While this may be a popular view — that the US, as a savings \ndeficit nation, needs a globalised world to finance its external balance —I \ncontest this conclusion. I think it will be extremely difficult for the \ninternational status of the dollar to be supplanted, even with Mr Trump as \nthe President. The dollar losing its hegemonic status has been a popular \nthesis by many academics over the last twenty years — precisely the period \nwhen the dollar's international and reserve currency status has risen. In \nmany ways, the sturdiness of the dollar's global status has surprised some \npeople, because globalisation is supposed to lead to a multi-polar world \nwhere the US loses its dominance. That is certainly true for the real \neconomy, but exactly the opposite has happened for the dollar. This is a \npoint I've tried hard to make over the years, that financial globalisation is \nuni-polar, even though trade globalisation is multi-polar. Look at how the \nrise in the dollar is hurting, disproportionately, the high-yield and EM \ncurrencies. Further, which currencies might replace the dollar? The EUR \nitself is still in an existential crisis; nothing needs to be said about the JPY; \nChina could not even dare opening up its capital account. In fact, Beijing \nhas just issued even more 'strict controls' on overseas investment, after \nexperiencing some USD207 billion in outflows in Q3 2016. Just because \nPresident Trump's prospective trade policy may not be politically correct \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026641 \ndoes not imply that there will be a demise of the dollar, or that fewer people \nin the world would speak English in protest. If anything, I'm worried that a \nsharp rally in the dollar could trigger another financial crisis in EM... Don't \nget me wrong, I do not believe the dominance of the dollar is good for the \nglobal financial/monetary system. But it is a trend that is difficult to reverse, \nunless the structural integrity of the EUR is enhanced, and the foundations of \nthe RMB market are improved. Increasing returns to scale have made \nEnglish/dollar popular, and it will be increasingly difficult to challenge their \nroles as the world internationalizes. (5) The BIS recently published an \ninteresting and important paper (`The Dollar, Bank Leverage and the \nDeviation from Covered Interest Parity,' by H.S. Shin et al., BIS WP 592) \non how a stronger dollar could lead to a tightening in lending conditions in \nthe rest of the world, including EM. ' 111 he value of the dollar plays the role \nof a barometer of risk-taking capacity in capital markets. In particular, it is \nthe spot exchange rate of the dollar which plays a crucial role... [7] he \nstrength of the dollar is a key determinant of bank leverage... Our results \npoint to the financial channel of exchange rates, through which fluctuations \nin the strength of the dollar set in motion changes in capital market \nintermediation spreads that respond at a high frequency._ [Ili is when the \ndomestic currency appreciates, financial conditions in that country loosen, \nand CIP deviations narrow... [A] strengthening of US dollar has adverse \nimpacts on bank balance sheets, which, in turn, reduces banks ' risk bearing \ncapacity.' The findings of this paper are consistent with two of the points \nmade above, that we may re-enter a phase that is not that positive for EM \ncurrencies and that the dominance of the dollar as an international currency \nis having unintended consequences for the rest of the world, out of line with \nthe local fundamentals. \nTrump and Europe. Political and social pressures have returned to Europe, \nand could continue to accentuate the centrifugal forces in the region. There \nare many risk events on the horizon, including the Austrian Presidential \nelection on December 4 (the worry here is a victory for Mr Norbert Hofer of \nthe far right party), the Italian referendum on Constitutional reform on \nDecember 4 (while a 'no' outcome is largely priced-in, an actual 'no' \noutcome may trigger a series of events in Italy that might pose some \ndownside risks to Italian banks and in turn other European banks), the Dutch \nparliamentary election on March 15, 2017 (the worry here is further \nadvances by the far right party led by Geert Wilders), the first round of the \nFrench presidential election on April 23 and the second round on May 7, UK \nlocal elections on May 4 (this will be the first major electoral test for PM \nMay), and finally German regional elections on May 7 and 14 and the \nparliamentary election in September. (1) I don't think the direction of \ncausality runs from Trump to Europe, but that the underlying forces \npropelling both Brexit and Trump are the same forces that are pushing the \npolitical centre of mass to the right in Europe. This direction of causality is \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026642 \ni \nimportant to appreciate, I think, because if one believed that the direction of \ncausality is the opposite, that Trump causes other changes that would have \nbeen avoidable if Ms Clinton had won, one would come up with the wrong \nconclusions on what to do to stop the global shift in sentiment. (2) The \nEconomist had a special edition last week on the rising nationalism in the \ndeveloped West, as if it's an unfounded, random and sinister event that \nneeds to be suppressed by all means necessary. For various reasons, the \npolitical left is in decline in the developed West. Look at the UK's Labour \nParty and the US' Democratic Party. In France, only 1 out of 20 people \napproves of Hollande's performance. (3) The Presidential race in France is \nnow between the Centre Right (Mr Fillon from the Republican Party) and \nthe Far Right (Ms Le Pen from National Front). The pendulum in Europe, in \nmy view, will swing to the right, and possibly overshoot, as pendulums tend \nto do... which is not good, but an unavoidable consequence of the pendulum \nhaving overshot to the left in the past... In any case, with the Republican \nprimary being out of the way, the campaign will start in earnest, with the \nfirst round of the Presidential elections to take place in April and the second \nround in May. FWIW, Mr Fillon looks like a stronger candidate than Mr \nSarkozy to challenge Ms Le Pen. France, under Mr Fillon, could very well \nenter a period of economic reform and rejuvenation, I am guessing. In short, \nMr Fillon's victory last weekend could be a major positive for France, I \nthink. \nThe trouble with macroeconomics. The rebellion against the establishment \nhas also begun in the nerdy field of macro economics, led in part by Prof \nPaul Romer of the Stern School of Business. He, of course, has made \nenemies in the field with his view — a view I share: 'For more than three \ndecades, macroeconomics has gone backwards. The treatment of \nidentification now is no more credible than in the early 1970s but escapes \nchallenge because it is so much more opaque. Macroeconomic theorists \ndismiss mere facts by feigning an obtuse ignorance about such simple \nassertions as \"tight monetwy policy can cause a recession.\" Their models \nattribute fluctuations in aggregate variables to imaginary causal forces that \nare not influenced by the action that any person takes. A parallel with string \ntheory from physics hints at a general failure mode of science that is \ntriggered when respect for highly regarded leaders evolves into a deference \nto authority that displaces objective fact from its position as the ultimate \ndeterminant of scientific truth.' Group think has become a serious \nimpediment to advances and renewals in this important field. Misguided \npolicies have also had significant consequences for people's lives around the \nworld. \nTrade globalization. There will likely be a shift from unconditional, \nuncontrolled, and unmanaged trade globalisation, i.e. 'free trade', to 'fair \ntrade,'. Trade globalisation of the type that we have just experienced \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026643 \nexchanged rising economic and political inequality for overall \nprosperity. We have simply reached a point where this rising inequality is \nno longer sustainable in democracies. This is not too different from what \nBeijing has been struggling with — to slow down the headline economic \ngrowth rate in exchange for more balance in various parts of the economy, in \norder to allow its development to be more sustainable. The parallels in the \nWest seem quite clear to me. Fighting against this shift in the West, as most \nmainstream media seem to be doing, is tantamount to those in China who are \nfighting against the economic slowdown. (1) TPP is effectively dead, even \nthough there are some who are urging that TPP goes ahead without the \nUS. But I think multilateral trade pacts are in jeopardy. The Trump \nAdministration still wants to have trade arrangements, but they will be \nbilateral and done with countries deemed friendly to the US. (2) The UK is \nin a great position to deal with the Trump Administration because all the UK \nneeds is a bilateral trade arrangement that won't take as long to work out, \ncompared to a multilateral trade arrangement. The UK just went from the \n'back of the queue' (which was an insulting declaration by President Obama, \nconspicuously using the word 'queue' to make sure the Brits understood \nhim) to the 'front of the line.' (3) China was never a part of the TPP \ndiscussions. In fact, TPP was designed from day one to marginalise China, \nto replace the current trade arrangement based on WTO rules to something \nthat puts China at a disadvantage. This is why Beijing is not unhappy with \nthe Trump Administration's desire to terminate the TPP discussions. (4) \n'America First' does not only mean 'world second,' that the US will take \nactions to benefit the US even if these policies come at the expense of the \nrest of the world. It also means that policies will be aimed at addressing the \ninequality and inequity in the US, even if it means that the overall effects on \nthe US may be negative. (5) In sum, I don't think trade globalisation will \nreverse. But it will slow down dramatically and be substituted with a \ndifferent web of bilateral arrangements. I think this is a positive \ndevelopment, as the previous model of global growth was unsustainable, \neven if it generated the biggest aggregate prosperity for the world. (6) The \nnext US Treasury Secretary will likely be instructed by President Trump to \nlabel China as a currency manipulator. While this would be a verdict \nwithout basis, in my view, such a finding could be used as an excuse to \nescalate the talks of protectionism. \nSome musings... (1) President Obama just awarded his last round of \nPresidential Medals of Freedom (America's highest civilian honour) to \nMichael Jordan, Ellen DeGeneres, Robert de Niro, and others. Many of \nthese award recipients were vocal critics of Mr Trump. My views on \npolitics really don't matter... But for what it is worth, the reason why I have \nbeen more vocal than I should have been about Brexit and the US Elections \nis related to my own personal experience. I have witnessed how a previous \nharmonious society could very quickly degenerate into a permanent state of \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026644 \nethnic hatred, through identity politics. This happened in Taiwan, where I \ngrew up. When I was a child, I was fluent in Mandarin and Taiwanese, as \nmost of the children I was friends with were not recent immigrants from \nMainland China like my family was. There were no social conflicts, as far \nas I recall, until the pro-independence movement riled up those who \nconsidered themselves 'Taiwanese' against the 'Mainlanders' like \nmyself Some of my Taiwanese childhood friends are no longer on speaking \nterms with me, simply because I'm a 'Mainlander.' Taiwan's economic \ndevelopment came to a sudden halt, as people were in a constant state of \nfeeling mistreated by the other group. The pendulum would swing from one \nside (green) to the other (blue), each time a President is found to have \ncommitted blatant and large-scale corruption. The politicians won, but the \npeople lost. This is one reason why I deeply resent identity politics and fear \nthat the proponents don't truly understand how dangerous this game really \ncan be. In contrast to the prevalent view, I believe indentity politics are \nthemselves divisive. Economic cycles and political cycles come and go, but \npeople can hate each other for generations. Look around the world; I think \nwe can find plenty examples of irrational hatred between ethnic groups, \nironically because one group felt they were wronged by another and the \npolitical discussions got hijacked by overly zealous politicians. (2) I love \nMichael Jordan and have nothing against Ellen DeGeneres, but think Robert \nde Niro made a fool of himself in that video. While this may not interest \nPresident Obama, Mr Joe Sutter just passed away: he was the 'Father of the \nBoeing 747', the lead engineer that designed and built the first B-747 in \n1969. Maybe one day someone will do a movie about him, and the actor \nplaying him could win the Presidential Medal of Freedom... (3) An artist in \nChina made a sculpture of a black swan (see the photo below), which was \nplaced in a shopping mall in Beijing on the other side of the street from the \nheadquarters of CSRC (China Securities Regulatory Commission) — the \ngovernment agency in charge of the securities markets and the agency that \nintervened to support the Chinese equity markets. This sculpture was \nquickly removed by government agents, within 3 hours of it being placed \nthere. Months earlier, there were two sculptures of bears (mama bear and a \nbaby bear) that were placed outside the same mall, and they were also \nremoved quickly... Maybe I was wrong for belittling artists and \nentertainers: they may have the power to bring down the USD9 trillion \nequity markets in China with a small sculpture... \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026645 \nslj \nThis research note is provided by Eurizon SLJ Capital Limited, a Limited Company with Company Number: \n9775525, registered in England with Registered Office Address 100 Brompton Road, SW3 lER.
