  "text": "It's hard to imagine, but true: Summer will slip away before you know it. Which means it's time for a mini-getaway to one of\nyour favorite cities. And this is the time to go - the streets are quieter, the parks are in bloom and concerts, movies and\nperformances are staged nearly every day.
