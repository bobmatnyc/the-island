  "text": "if the flotilla sets sail does not seem far-fetched, despite the\norganizers’ vows to the contrary.\n\nSo the flotilla has virtually no support in Israel. Still, some are\nuncomfortable with the way the project has been criticized as an\nattack on Israel itself.\n\nShlomo Avineri, a historian and onetime director general of Israel’s\nforeign ministry, wrote in the Haaretz newspaper last week that when\nthe flotilla is described as aimed at delegitimizing Israel, he recalls\nthe Soviet Union’s reaction to any criticism as an assault on its right\nto exist. Opposition to Israeli policy is not the same as an attack on its\nexistence, he said, and the government’s approach damages Israel.\nHis argument about the flotilla points to the larger dynamic: the\nIsraeli-Palestinian dispute is increasingly disintegrating from a debate\nover borders and security into a battle between those claiming that\nIsrael is a genocidal machine and those who dismiss every attack on\nits policy as an assault on its essence.\n\nEthan Bronner is the Jerusalem bureau chief of The New York Times.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029936",
