  "text": "That’s a Math Problem...\n\ne If an expense rises by 26% and the ability to pay rises by only 3%,\nthe math doesn’t work. A computer in a science fiction movie might\nblurt out, ‘does not compute...does not compute...’\n\ne “Something’s Gotta Give...’ as the 2003 film put it.\n\ne A mathematician or economist would say, ‘the expense must go down or\nthe ability to pay must rise to match the expense.’\n\ne Simple math implies that the age for collecting full benefits should rise\nfrom 67 to 72, so that expenses more closely match workers’ ability to\npay. Under this scenario, while Americans are living 30% longer, the\n‘retirement’ age would rise just 7%, still well below the increase in life\nexpectancy since Social Security was created.\n\nKP\ni USA Inc. | Income Statement Drilldown 139\n\nSocial Security: Unless The Program Is Restructured, Cash Flow\n\nWill Turn Negative by 2015E Owing to Aging Population\n\nReal Social Security Annual Operating Income, 1982 — 2036E\n\nIRIN mm 0 wr em owe sae oo tse nae t= = fe = ms SN = 8 A = =\n2015+\nPermanent\n$100 ~~~ - ~~~ -- = - Negative Cash Flow --------------------\n\n$0\n\nAnnual Social Security Net Cash Flow ($B)\nOo\nOo\n\n1982 1987 1992 1997 2002 2007 2012E 2017E 2022E 2027E 2032E\n\nNote: Data adjusted for inflation in real 2009 dollars.
