Syria Shell\nPetroleum Dev. B.V., 213 F.3d 841, 846-47\n(th Cir.2000) (alteration in  original)).\nThe Second Circuit held that the KDIC\nwas an organ of Korea because it was\nformed by statute and presidential decree;\nit performs the governmental functions of\nprotecting depositors and promoting finan-\ncial stability; its directors are appointed\nby the Ministry of Finance and Economy;\nits president is appointed by the President\nof the Republic of Korea; and many of its\noperations are overseen by the Ministry of\nFinance and Economy. I[d.\n\nThe banks argued that once the court\ndetermined KDIC was an organ of the\nforeign state, the banks automatically be-\ncame instrumentalities or agencies of the\nstate because KDIC owned a majority of\ntheir stock. Id. The Second Circuit reject-\ned this argument, finding such a holding\nwould “permit an infinite number of sub-\nsidiaries to enjoy sovereign immunity, ...\nwould be incompatible with the purpose of\nthe FSIA, which is to grant governmental,\nnot private corporate immunity, and ...\nwould reflect infidelity to the Supreme\nCourt’s reasoning in Dole Food.” Id. at\n218. Accordingly, it reiterated that “‘a\nsubsidiary of an instrumentality is not it-\nself entitled to instrumentality status’ ...\nand that ‘only direct ownership of a major-\nity of shares by the foreign state satisfies\nthe statutory requirement.” Jd. (quoting\nDole Food, 5388 U.S. at 473-74, 123 S.Ct.\n1655).\n\nThe Second Circuit determined the\nKDIC was an organ of Korea by consider-\ning whether it was created and supervised\nby a foreign state and whether public em-\nployees were performing public functions.\nId. at 217. Under its reasoning, it would\nappear the PIF is also an organ. It was\ncreated by royal decree, it is supervised by\nthe Kingdom’s Council of Ministers and\nstaffed with government employees. See\nPIF Charter.\n\nYet, under the “legal characteristics”\ntest, the PIF could qualify as a political\nsubdivision. See Hyatt, 945 F.Supp. at\n680. In Hyatt, a court in this district\nreasoned that a statutory requirement of\nan agency or instrumentality, as opposed\nto a political subdivision, is that it is a\n“separate legal person ... that can func-\ntion independent of the state.” Jd. at 684.\nIf an entity could sue and be sued, own\nproperty, and contract in its own name, it\nwould be considered an agency or instru-\nmentality and not a political subdivision.\nId. at 685. NCB submits the PIF sues\nand is sued as, and generally holds proper-\nty on behalf of, the Ministry of Finance.\nAl-Wohaibi Aff. 199, 12.\n\nNCB argues the Court should employ\nthe “core functions” test outlined in Tran-\nsaero, Inc. v. La Fuerza Aerea Boliviana,\n30 F.3d 148 (D.C.Cir.1994), to find that the\nPIF is the equivalent of the Kingdom.\nUnder this test, if the entity’s core func-\ntions are governmental, it is considered\nthe state itself. Jd. at 153. If its functions\nare commercial in nature, it is considered\nan instrumentality. /d. This Court is gov-\nerned by Second Circuit precedent and\nfinds Filler and Hyatt to be controlling.\nEven if it were to adopt Transaero, howev-\ner, the Court finds on the record before it\nthat the PIF’s emphasis on commercial\nprojects precludes a finding that its core\nfunctions are governmental in nature.
