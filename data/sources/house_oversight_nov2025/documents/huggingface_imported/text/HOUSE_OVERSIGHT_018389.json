  "text": "between points is also an act of drawing a line around those points. It is not simply\nthat we’re enmeshed in networks now; no, we're enclosed even entrapped by them.\nIf the great ambition of Cecil Rhodes’ era was for the expansive conquest of\nterritory, in our own it is for the construction and manipulation of gated spaces.\nGatelands.\n\nIn an age of network power, no position is more important, formidable, influential\nor profitable than that of the gatekeeper. Defining who is in or out of any network is\namong the most essential moves of design. In financial markets, on the Internet\nbackbone or inside the human immune system, the accept-or-reject decision\ndetermines a great deal. The first sign of order breaking down, whether it is the\nRoman Empire or your lungs, is an inability to manage what slips in and out. Flows\nof bits, of migrants, of gold and patents and medicines -— all of these life-giving forces\ncan be controlled, bent for good or stopped for ill, as they pass through or collide\nwith gates. By gates I mean not only in-out passages but all of the tools that meter\nand enclose the various Gatelands: Protocols, languages, block-chains. Whatever\nbinds and shapes an information topology. Any sort of code or encryption or binary\ninstruction that can unlock an in and out. If you want to make a fortune or a\nrevolution (or both), if you hope to shatter some barrier of tools or ideas between\nyou and a dream, or to lead a religious revival, spread an infection of hate or\nrevolution or insidious Morris-style computer code — then fundamentally this is\nwhat you have to consider: Where are the gates? How to smash them? How to build\nyour own? We are entering, as a result of our dependence on networks of all sorts, a\nlandscape where the very clustering of power creates new border regions, bridges\nand gates. If older, hierarchical systems craved a top - a king, a superpower, a Pope\n- our connected, meshlike age demands valves and protocols and gates. It hungers\nfor connection, which means it hungers too for throttles and accelerators and\nbrakes. And of course people to run them. To speed them up. Slow them. Finger off\nswitches. This reordering of power will produce, is producing, a fight over\ntopological spaces for finance, biology, trade or pretty much any source of power.\nThe scramble is as urgent, decisive and essential as the one Rhodes and his peers\nembarked upon. Inside or out? A fresh Meliananxiety haunts us: Are you the\ngatekeeper? Or the gatekept?\n\nWe wander into Gateland the moment we switch our phones on. We enter it when\nwe book an airline ticket, when our genetics folds into a pool of data, or when we\ntake a new degree, master a computer language, or check on friends via one stateful\nconnected platform or another. We enter it, in short, when we connect. Gatekeepers\nchoose what we see. They determine the rules we follow, what we can and can’t\nchange. They reward us too - once we're inside — with benefits of speed, knowledge\nand safety. Gatekeepers, which can be people or protocols or code, decide who can\njoin closed communities and who is left out and why. They pass us the fine benefit of\nthe compression of time, even as they expose us to the zipper of instant potential\ndisaster hitting everyone in a closed space at once. Gatekeepers control, for instance,\nhow (and how fast) financial data moves between members of light-speed “in the\nknow” trading pools, and the suckers outside. What you can see in your phone or\nyour university computer, why, how - all of these choices have to be made by\n\n157\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018389",
