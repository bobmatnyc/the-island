  "text": "23\n\ntoo much attention to the Middle East, and too little to Asia — must\nembrace a shift in priorities.\n\nOf course, in the midst of today’s ongoing Arab revolutions, America\ncannot simply ignore the Middle East. Nor must the US give up hope\non the Israel-Palestine front, or on its efforts to contain Iran’s nuclear\nambitions. But it is in Asia that history is unfolding — and where the\nUS must define its long-term global strategy.\n\nMust the US, as Henry Kissinger suggests in his latest book On\nChina, consider the prospect of a “Pacific Community” that, unlike\nthe Cold War-era Atlantic Community, is not based on common\nculture and values in the face of a direct threat, but on common\ninterests in an “age of rebalancing of world order’’?\n\nAmerica’s resilience may contrast with Europe’s multiple\nweaknesses. But resilience will not be enough. The US must get back\ninto shape to face tomorrow’s challenges, and that means restoring\neconomic growth, reducing deficits, and improving infrastructure.\nParadoxically, only a more confident America can accept a reduced\nglobal status, because reconciling oneself to change is always easier\nonce one has taken the steps needed to adjust to it.\n\nDominique Moisi is the author of The Geopolitics of Emotion.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031963",
