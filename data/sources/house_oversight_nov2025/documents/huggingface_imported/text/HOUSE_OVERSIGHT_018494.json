  "text": "Subspace is so hard to describe. I've written about it before, in passing, so many times,\nbecause it's so important, but I've never come up with a good description for it; and when\nI Google for it I can see that other people have the same problem. When I'm starting to go\ninto subspace it's just soft and dark and slow. But when I'm really far under, I'm totally\nblank. Falling. Flying.\n\nSomewhere else.\nCome back.\n\nWhat is it, where do I go? It's just submissive, masochist headspace. But I don't always\nget into subspace when I submit, and I don't always get into it when I take pain either. I'm\nnot sure what the other ingredients are: some amount of trust, of course. And strong\nfeelings about my partner make everything more intense... way more intense. Orders of\nmagnitude more intense. Still, I've had new partners put me under with surprising\nthoroughness.\n\nIt's a lot like deep sexual arousal -- hard to think, hard to process, hard to make decisions\n-- but the deepest sexual arousal does not put me anywhere near deep subspace. Deep\nsubspace is. More. Than anything else.\n\nSome S&M teachers tell people not to drive after an S&M encounter, not for a while; not\nuntil you're over the subspace. They compare it to an altered state, like being drunk.\nSome S&M teachers caution that it's dangerous for the dominant partner to suggest a new\nactivity in the middle of an S&M encounter -- something that wasn't negotiated\nbeforehand -- because the submissive may not be able to think clearly enough to consent.\n(And because in those moments, the submissive will have a harder time than ever saying\nno.)\n\nI sometimes think that when I was younger and less experienced, I abandoned myself to\nsubspace more easily. I'm better at pulling myself out of subspace now, but I think the\ncost may be that it's harder for me to really get into it. (Safety first?) I trained myself to\nbe able to say, \"Don't stop,\" when I wanted my partner to keep going. (Sound easy? Trust\nme, it took a while.) Playing with unfamiliar partners, I trained myself to be on guard.\n(One of my sex worker friends told me once, \"I don't care how deep the subspace is, I can\nalways come out if the client tries to fuck me without a condom.\") I got better at calling\nmy safeword before I had to -- asking my partner to do something else or give me a\nbreak, rather than suddenly stopping everything once I hit my absolute limit.\n\nI am nowhere near perfect, of course. In particular, I can rarely answer complicated\nquestions, and sometimes my partners literally can't get me to answer any questions\nwhen I'm subspaced. Sometimes it takes me a long time to come out, and partners may\nget nervous while I'm surfacing. But I'm not sure these aspects can actually be eliminated\nfrom subspace. And I've gotten better.\n\nI'm sure that in an emergency, I could talk and function straight out of heavy subspace. I\ndoubt I would be optimally intelligent and thoughtful, however.\n\nWhen I was younger, I'd get frustrated with my partner if he tried to ask me questions or\nclarify things or otherwise check in with me when I was in subspace. Damn it, can't you\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018494",
