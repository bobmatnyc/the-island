He was our most\nvaluable espionage source. It is the delivery of secrets, not the methods used, that counts.”\n\n“Tf some unknown person simply delivered a trove of top-secret communications secrets to the\ndoorstep of Russia would they it be accepted?” I asked with Snowden in mind.\n\n“T can’t say what the SVR would do today. I am long retired” he said, with a nostalgic shake\nof his head. “But in my day, we needed some reason to believe to believe the gift was genuine.”\n\n“Would you need to vet the person delivering it?”\n\n“With Hanssen we did not have that opportunity,” he said. “If we believed the documents were\ngenuine, we would of course grab them.”\n\nThe final recruitment I asked Cherkashin about was that of Ronald Pelton, the civilian\nemployee of the NSA who had retired in 1979. Pelton had left the NSA without taking any\nclassified documents with him. After retiring, he had financial difficulties, and he sought to get\nmoney from the KGB. On January 14, 1980, he walked into the Soviet embassy in Washington\nDC and asked to see an intelligence officer. After he was ushered into secure debriefing room, he\nsaid that he had information that Russia would find interesting, but he wanted money in return.\nWhat interested me about the Pelton case was that Cherkashin proceeded to recruit Pelton even\nthough he was no longer working at the NSA, and Pelton no longer had access to the NSA. In\naddition, since the FBI had 24 hour surveillance on the embassy, Pelton had almost certainly been\nphotographed entering it and also possibly had been recorded asking for an intelligence officer by\nelectronic bugs that the KGB suspected that NSA had planted in the embassy. What did the KGB\ndo in a situation in which ex-civilian employee at the NSA possessed no documents?\n\nDespite the risks involved, Cherkashin decided Pelton had to be debriefed by communications\nintelligence specialists. So he had him disguised as a utility worker and smuggled out in a van to\nthe residential compound of the Ambassador in Georgetown. A few days later, he was dropped\noff at a shopping mall, “Why did you go to such effort if Pelton had neither documents nor access\nto the NSA?” I asked.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020352",
