Although there is potential for the mortgage business to\ncreate a headwind if the CFPB issued a negative ruling against Zillow, we still like the\nstock into the quarter, as we prefer business with minimal competition, and believe that\nthe high ROI of the real estate premium platform to real estate agents will ensure\nagents buy placements on Zillow regardless of mortgage broker involvement. We\nmaintain our $42 PO based on a 6x our 2018E EV/Sales and supported by our DCF\nvaluation. Our multiple is roughly in-line for online real estate lead generation sites in\nother countries operating in developed countries.\n\nBankof America 2 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 49\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014935",
