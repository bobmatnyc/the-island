  "text": "The poem I'm hoping you would read is one that we discussed, William Carlos Williams’s iconic poem\n\n“This Is Just to Say.” The poem is copied below. There are, naturally, commentaries on it I could share,\n\nif you wanted to read some, but you seem to have already thought about it quite a bit.\n\nThis Is Just to Say\n\nI have eaten\nthe plums\nthat were in\nthe icebox\n\nand which\n\nyou were probably\nsaving\n\nfor breakfast\n\nForgive me\n\nthey were delicious\nso sweet\n\nand so cold\n\nLogistically, we are at your service. I would be happy to film you when I visit New York on October\n\n24th. Or, I would love it if you would come visit Larry and me in Boston with Jeffrey. We could show\n\nyou and Soon Yi around Harvard, eat a big bowl of plums, and talk poetry. I would introduce you on\n\ncamera and you'd read, or recite, and we'd perhaps talk about the poem for a moment.\n\nThank you very much for considering this proposal. I admire you immensely and would feel honored to\n\nbring you into this project.\n\nBest,\nLisa New\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029544",
