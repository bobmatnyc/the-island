  "text": "effective rate greater than 90% of the maximum U.S. corporate income tax rate is not taxable to a\nUnited States Shareholder under the CFC rules if the United States Shareholder so elects.\n\nThe rules applicable to CFCs are complex, and the foregoing summary of the U.S. federal\nincome taxation of U.S. Partners indirectly owning an interest in a CFC is general in nature. The\nGeneral Partner cannot provide any assurance that the Fund’s portfolio companies will not be\nCFCs. The CFC rules, however, generally should not affect tax-exempt U.S. Partners.\n\nU.S. Foreign Tax Credits - The Fund may make investments in entities that are formed and\noperating under the laws of countries other than the United States. The countries in which these\nentities are organized and operate may impose taxes on the income of, and distributions or\nother payments made by, these entities. In addition, the Fund and/or the Partners may be\nrequired to file tax or information returns in such non-U.S. jurisdictions. U.S. Partners may be\nentitled, under certain circumstances, to a reduced rate of non-US. tax on their shares of such\nincome or distributions under tax treaties between the United States and the non-US.\njurisdictions imposing such tax, or may, in certain circumstances, be entitled under such treaties\nto file tax returns in such jurisdictions and claim refunds of any amounts of non-U.S. tax over-\nwithheld.\n\nSubject to applicable limitations on foreign tax credits, a U.S. Partner that is subject to U.S.\nfederal income taxation generally should be entitled to elect to treat foreign taxes withheld from\nsuch Partner’s share of the Fund’s dividend and interest income as foreign income taxes eligible\nfor credit against such Partner’s U.S. federal income tax liability. Similarly, each U.S. Partner’s\nshare of any foreign taxes which may be imposed on capital gains or other income realized by\nthe Fund generally should be treated as creditable foreign income taxes. Capital gains realized\nby the Fund, however, may be considered to be from sources within the U.S., which may\neffectively limit the amount of foreign tax credit allowed to the U.S. Partner. Other complex tax\nrules may also limit the availability or use of foreign tax credits, depending on each U.S.\nPartner’s particular circumstances. Because of these limitations, U.S. Partners may be unable to\nclaim a credit for the full amount of their proportionate shares of any foreign taxes paid by the\nFund. U.S. Partners that do not elect to treat their shares of foreign taxes as creditable generally\nmay claim a deduction against U.S. taxable income for such taxes (subject to applicable\nlimitations on losses and deductions). Foreign tax credits or deductions generally will not\nprovide any benefit to tax-exempt U.S. Partners unless such Partners’ distributive shares of the\nincome or gains on which the related foreign income taxes are imposed constitute “unrelated\nbusiness taxable income” and certain other conditions are satisfied. However, since the\navailability of a credit or deduction depends on the particular circumstances of each U.S.\nPartner, Partners are advised to consult their own tax advisors.\n\nForeign Currency Issues - A U.S. Partner's distributive share of profits or losses realized by the\nFund on the conversion of U.S. dollars into non-U.S. currency, or of non-U.S. currency into U.S.\ndollars, generally will be treated as ordinary income or loss rather than capital gain or loss.\nFurther, if the Fund acquires, or becomes the obligor under, a debt instrument or enters into\ncertain other transactions, any of which is denominated in terms of a currency other than the\nU.S. dollar, fluctuations in the value of that currency relative to the U.S. dollar generally will\nresult in foreign currency gain or loss realized by the Fund and will be included in the U.S.\nPartners’ distributive shares of Fund profits or losses as U.S.-source ordinary income or loss\nrather than capital gain or loss.\n\n78 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024089",
