It\nis imperative we get a placement out by mid next week in order for us to hit the timeline I spoke to Mr. Epstein\nabout.. The fresh piece needs to come out while we are dislodging the current results (as you are observing\nnow).\n\nMr. Epstein if you have any questions on current status vs. our conversation around Jan 10. please advise - We\nare continuing to work aggressively to clean up results per our last call. Iam also available to discuss this at\nyour convenience today or over weekend.\n\nSincerely,\n\nTyler Shears\n\nOn Fri, Feb 7, 2014 at 10:47 AM, Christina Galbraith (iis > wrote:\nHi Tyler,\n\nOk thanks so much for the review.

I had reserved the\napproach of pushing non-website URLs for a few months because you expressed concern with making sure\nour URLs are on first page... but I had call w/ Mr. Epstein in the beginning of January and expressed that is a\nlimiting factor for moving Forbes/NYPost as quickly as we'd like.\n\nGetting up different types of results for different folks is required to dislodge the negative placements. Once\nthey are dislodged it is much easier to restore our websites back to the rankings and have our \"ideal\" first\npage. The reason for this is Google tracks click data on results and as soon as Forbes/NYPost are on second\npage they will begin a slow death (less clicks on those, more clicks on the ones we have on first page)\n\nFrom there we will see our properties shoot up due to the interlinking between them and the reinforcement we\ncan provide from sites like Harvard, Nat Geo, and any other publications we have influence over. Using the\n\"short-term\" links is one battle around other pages is just a part of the overall war... You saw how Google was\nchanging up much more dramatically when we had multiple Epstein's on the first page vs. having a saturated\nfirst page.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029551",
