  "text": "oversees the Mueller team. Indeed, Rosenstein, as recently as April,\npublicly declared that the President was not a target. This may have\nbeen a form of fig leaf to soothe a President who regularly demands\naides assure him he is not being pursued: the President does not\nbecome a formal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one.\n\nThe proposed indictment confronts Rosenstein with matters with\nwhich he has been intimately involved. The case, according to my\nconversations with White House and other sources familiar with the\ninvestigation, is fundamentally Trump versus the FBI, Justice\nDepartment, and Mueller investigation itself. In many ways, it boils\ndown to the word of former FBI Director James Comey against the word\nof Donald Trump. Rosenstein, at the President's behest, drafted a memo\njustifying the Comey firing for how the former FBI Director handled the\nHillary Clinton email investigation. But that justification, in an\nembarrassment for Rosenstein, was shortly brushed aside by the\nPresident when he admitted that he fired Comey to disrupt the Russian\ninvestigation. What's more, the indictment is said to charge that the\nfiring of Andrew McCabe, the former Deputy Director of the FBI, who\nreported directly to Rosenstein after the Comey dismissal, was an\ninstance of illegal retaliation by the President against a potential\nwitness.\n\nAccording to a source with knowledge of the proposed\nindictment, it will be all the more controversial because if finds the\nentire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain sight. Almost nothing\nabout the case involves new information. \"This indictment could have\nbeen drafted without anyone being interviewed,\" said this source.\nRather it takes well covered public events and moves them to a set of\ncircumstantial conclusions. There is no smoking gun beyond the often\nflagrant, custom-breaking, events of the President's 16 months in office.\nIndeed, much of the evidence is based on the President's public\nstatements and tweets about those events.\n\nThis is, according to White House sources who have gotten wind\nof this approach, good news: the case then, is just an issue of what\nmotives you ascribe to the President's behavior—behavior that is, the\nPresident's supporters believe it is easy to show, impulsive and not\nthought out. Hence no intent. For the Mueller team, it is precisely that\ncareless behavior and flagrant disregard for the rules that they aim to\nput on trial.\n\nThere is no certainty that the Special Counsel's office will\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029166",
