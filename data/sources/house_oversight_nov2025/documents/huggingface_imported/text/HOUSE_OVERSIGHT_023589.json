Daily data from 2-Jun-08 to 5-Jun-17. Source: BofA Merril Lynch Global Research. Data as of 5Jun-17\n\nEnel stock attractive vs credit given cheap bullish risky & high div yield vs CDS\n\nOn 31-May-17, we recommended buying SX5E bullish risk reversals and selling IBOXX\nHY TRS as a low carry / low risk trade with gearing to improving earnings and FCF. We\nnow look for similar opportunities at the single name level. Among the 50 companies\nwhich have high projected 12m dividend yield relative to bond yields (as highlighted by\nBofAML credit and equity strategists — Chart 9), we highlight a subset (15 names) where\nwe have option data since at least Jun-12 (last 5yrs). The names in the bottom-right\ncorner of Chart 31 indicate the cheapest 3m -25d put/+25delta call risk-reversals where\nprojected dividend yield is highest relative to the CDS spread. We note that:\n\n« Royal Dutch Shell’s stock yield is attractive vs CDS: Shell’s projected 12m div\nyield is 7.5% while its CDS is 52bps (0.5%), resulting in a div yield-CDS spread of\n7.0%, the highest in our screen; this suggests value in Shell equity vs credit.\n\n¢ Cheap bullish risk reversals in Enel and Iberdrola: 3m -25delta put/+25delta call\nrisk reversals in Enel and Iberdrola are the lowest across the 15 names in Chart 31.\nNotably, bullish risk reversals in Enel are also particularly cheap versus history as\nthe price of 3m -95%f / +105%f bullish risk reversals is below its 5\" 5-y %-ile.\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Global Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 15\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023589",
