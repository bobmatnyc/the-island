The problem is this machine has\nno greater power than a regular Turing machine. Let me show you why.\n\nA non-deterministic machine is essentially the same as a single\nTuring machine; each time there is a branch in the program you would\nstart running two processes. The first process works on every even tick\nof the computer clock and the other on every odd tick. Now we have a\nsingle machine running two branches at the same time. Using this trick\nover and over again, a single machine can run a program exploring every\npossible branch. Although it generates an enormous number of branches\nand takes a huge time to run, it is still a single machine and we have an\ninfinity of time on our hands. Therefore, the machine is limited as before.\n\nWe are not doing well so far and we have already exhausted an\ninfinite number of options! Let’s try a different tack. We know true\nrandomness is non-computable, the sort of randomness generated by\nthe Lavarand we examined earlier in the book. Might this help? Truly\nrandom processes can’t be simulated by a computer. If we throw this into\nthe pot might it let us compute something a Turing machine cannot?\n\nAgain, no.\n\nThis idea still only generates a machine as powerful as the non-\ndeterministic machine above. A non-deterministic Turing machine runs\nevery possible program. All a random one does is choose some of the\nsame paths at random. It, therefore, can’t be any more powerful. The one\ndifference is that it can generate non-computable numbers. However, the\nonly interesting characteristic of these numbers is they are truly random\nand this randomness was an input. Their presence does not make the\nmachine any more powerful.\n\nThere are quite a few proposals for hyper-computers that are just\ncleverly dressed up versions of the machines we have already met and\ndismissed. For example, it has been proposed the Internet could form\na super-Turing machine. This is known as a site machine because the\nprocessing is distributed across many sites linked together through the\nInternet. It is proposed each site could act as an oracle to the others. This\nis quite an elegant idea, and some proofs have been offered that show\nsuch a machine is capable of generating non-computable functions. The\nproblem with this idea is that you can simply draw an imaginary line\naround the whole site machine and it looks exactly like a big Turing\nmachine. There is no conceptual difference between such a machine\nand a regular computer with subroutines. After all, that’s in Turing’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015966",
