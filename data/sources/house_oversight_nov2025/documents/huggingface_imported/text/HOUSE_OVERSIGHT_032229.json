If he says he hasn't been on the plane or to the house, then that gives\nyou a valuable PR and political currency. You can hang him in a way that potentially generates a positive\nbenefit for you, or, if it really looks like he could win, you could save him, generating a debt. Of course, it is\npossible that, when asked, he'll say Jeffrey is a great guy and has gotten a raw deal and is a victim of political\ncorrectness, which is to be outlawed in a Trump regime.\n\nOn Tue, Dec 15, 2015 at 11:52 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\nif we were able to craft an answer for him, what do you think it should be?\n\nOn Tue, Dec 15, 2015 at 8:00 PM, Michael Wolff (i wrote:\n\nI hear CNN planning to ask Trump tonight about his relationship with you--either on air or in scrum\nafterwards.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
