Such a line had to be, to the best of\nthe United Nations’ knowledge, in conformity with Lebanon’s international boundar-\nies. On this basis, and with the consent of the parties, the UN Secretary-General could\nthen report to the Security Council and eventually recommend that it should confirm\nthat Israel had ended its occupation. This understanding led to an agreement for the\nUnited Nations to negotiate with the Governments of Lebanon, Syria and Israel.\nThrough intense, difficult, and stormy tripartite negotiations over five months, the\nUN Secretary-General was in May 2000 able to report to the Security Council that the\nUN had reached an agreement with Israel, Syria, and Lebanon on a line of withdrawal\n(the so-called Blue Line). On this basis, it was determined that Israeli troops had left all\nLebanese territory. Further, he reported that, consistent with UN requirements, Israel’s\nLebanese proxy, the South Lebanese Army (SLA), had been disarmed and disbanded.\nSubsequently, the UN Security Council confirmed the end of Israel’s occupation of\nSouthern Lebanon in fulfillment of Security Council Resolutions 425 and 426 of 1978.\n\nIn September 2004, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 1559. Secretary-\nGeneral Kofi Annan appointed me as his special envoy for its implementation. In a\nnutshell the resolution called for respect for Lebanon’s sovereignty, territorial integrity,\nand political independence; the disbanding and disarming of all Lebanese and non-\nLebanese militias; and the withdrawal of all foreign troops. After Israel’s full withdrawal\nfrom Lebanon in 2000, the only remaining foreign troops were Syrian. Immediately\nafter the resolution was adopted, I engaged in intense negotiations with President\nAssad, who until the assassination of former Prime Minister Rafic Hariri on 14\nFebruary 2005, was consistently resistant to move on the issue. On 12 March 2005, I\nwas airborne with a small UN team, among them Fabrice Aidan, on my way to\nDamascus for a new round of talks with the President. Midway, the captain informed\nme that he was requested to change course and land in Aleppo. Afterwards I was told\nthat the reason was to avoid the media who were waiting for the arrival of the UN team\nin Damascus. I was picked up at Aleppo airport by Walid Muallem, who was then\nDeputy Foreign Minister. He brought me to Assad’s villa, where a few hours of\nnegotiations resulted in the Aleppo understanding, which outlined Syria’s military\nwithdrawal from Lebanon with specific timelines. Assad honored his word, and\nended twenty-nine years of Syrian military presence in Lebanon consistent with\nResolution 1559.\n\nWhat is often forgotten in the recurrent doom and gloom in the Middle East, is that\nthe step-by-step approach, which started with the Camp David Accords of 1978, has\nfor more than thirty years led to conflict resolution: peace between Israel and Egypt; the\nOslo Accords; the mutual recognition of Israel and the PLO; the establishment of the\nPalestinian Authority in Gaza and the West Bank, which still functions with its\npresidency, cabinet, and ministries; peace between Israel and Jordan in 1994, with\nthe recognition of borders and a long-lasting security cooperation; Israel’s withdrawal\nfrom Southern Lebanon in 2000; and the subsequent Syrian military withdrawal five\nyears later; as well as Israel’s pull out from the Gaza Strip. All these steps would have\nbeen difficult, if not impossible, without the previous ones.\n\nIn 2000 the attempts to put a final end to the Syrian-Israeli and the Palestinian—\nIsraeli conflicts both failed. This exposes the risks of a totalist approach to solving such\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023171",
