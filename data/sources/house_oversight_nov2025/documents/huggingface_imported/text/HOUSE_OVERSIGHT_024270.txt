Feds explain sweet deal for billionaire sex offender Epstein

By JANE MUSGRAVE
The Palm Beach Post

WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. —
Federal prosecutors in Florida went
on the offensive this month, deny-
ing allegations that they bowed to
pressure from
billionaire Jef-
frey Epstein —a
resident of the
Virgin Islands
and Palm Beach,

Fla. and his

high-priced law-

yers at the ex-

pense of dozens

of teenage girls Jeffrey Epstein
he sexually abused.

In their first public comment
since 2007 when they negoti-
ated a deal that allowed Epstein
to escape federal charges — pros-
ecutors filed hundreds of pages of
documents in U.S. District Court,
explaining what led to the now
infamous non-prosecution agree-
ment that has been decried as “a
sweetheart deal.”

Contrary to claims by attorneys

representing two of Epstein’s vic-
tims in a lawsuit against the fed-
eral government, Assistant U.S.
Attorney Marie Villafana said she
and her superiors were trying to
help the traumatized young women
when they agreed to let Epstein
plead guilty to state prostitution
charges.

The now-64-year-old =moncy
manager, who spends most of his
time on his estate Little Saint James
in the territory, served 13 months of
an 18-month sentence in the Palm
Beach County Stockade. He was
allowed to leave cach day to go to
work.

Hoping to persuade U.S. District
Judge Kenneth Marra to throw out
the lawsuit that accuses the govern-
ment of violating the federal Crime
Victims Rights Act, Villafana said
she tried to keep Epstein’s victims
informed about the investigation
and the eventual plea deal. But, she
said, negotiations were sensitive
and neither Epstein, his victims nor
their attorneys made it casy.

For instance, she said, most of
the young women were extremely

Contrary to claims by attomeys representing two of Jeffrey Epstein’s victims in a
lawsuit against the federal goverment, Assistant U.S. Attomey Marie Villafana
said she and her superiors were trying to help the traumatized young women
when they agreed to let the now 64-year-old money manager plead guilty to state

prostitution charges.

reluctant or simply refused

to testify against Epstein, who had
paid them to give him sexually-
charged massages at his mansion.

One of the women who is now
suing the government insisted Ep-
stein never abused her, Villafana
wrote in a sworn affidavit.

“L hope Jeffrey, nothing happens
to Jeffrey because he's an awe-
some man and it would really be a
shame,” the woman, identified only
as Jane Doe 2, told FBI agents in
2007.

While Villafana said she didn’t
believe her, she also understood
the young woman's suffering.
Further, she knew she couldn't
force her or Epstein’s more than

two dozen other victims to testify
against him.

Jane Doe 1, who is also suing the
government, agreed to testify. But
Villafana said one victim wouldn't
have been cnough
Epstein.

Rather than let Epstein use his
considerable influence to evade
prosecution, she and top officials
at the U.S. Justice Department
crafted the plea deal.

In exchange for pleading guilty
to charges of solicitation of prosti-
tution and soliciting minors to en-
gage in prostitution in Palm Beach
County Circuit Court, Epstein
was not charged with any federal
counts. As part of the agreement,
Epstein had to register as a sex of-
fender and agree to settle civil law-
suits that his roughly 30 victims
filed against him.

Getting Epstein to agree to
pay restitution to his victims and
register as a sex offender were
key, Villafana wrote. Prosecutors
wanted to assure his victims that
they would be compensated and
that “other minors throughout the
country” would be protected she
wrote.

But shortly after Epstein signed
the agreement on Sept. 24, 2007,
he began fighting it, she said. He
and his legal team, including for-
mer U.S. Solicitor General Ken-
neth Starr, whose investigation
led to President Bill Clinton's im-
peachment, contacted high-level

to convict

justice department officials. They
challenged the terms of the non-
prosecution agreement.

Fearing it was falling apart, Vil-
lafana said her office and the FBI
resumed the investigation and in-
formed the victims of that by letter
in January 2008.

In their lawsuit, the victims’ at-
torneys, Bradley Edwards and Paul
Cassell, say the letter is evidence
of their claim that prosecutors lied
to the victims. They also claim that
prosecutors never told Epstein’s
victims about the plea deal.

Villafana said she didn't tell the
young women about the terms of
the agreement, fearing Epstein’s
attorneys would use it to crush
them if federal charges were filed
and the case went to trial. Savvy
attorneys would argue that the
women were testifying against Ep-
stein because federal prosecutors
told them they would get paid res-
titution if they did, she said.

When she learned Epstein
planned to plead guilty to the two
charges in circuit court on June 30,
2008, Villafana said she immedi-
ately notified Edwards. She said
she told him to alert his clients
so they could attend the hearing.
None did.

Cassell, a law professor at the
University of Utah, shrugged off
the government's new claims, call-
ing them “meritless.” A written
response will be filed at the end
of July, he said.
