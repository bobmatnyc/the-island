Mr. Ochstein did not\nobject.\n\nAMENDED MOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO IMPOSE A FINE OF\n$250.00 A DAY, COMMENCING ON MARCH 22, 2008 AND\nCONTINUING UNTIL COMPLIANCE IS ACHIEVED, SUCH FINE TO\nBE RECONSIDERED BASED ON PROGRESS OF COMPLETION\nSECONDED BY MS. DUEMLER\n\nMOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY\n\nD. Case # 08-2477, 215 Colonial Lane, Susan C. Lee Trust\nViolation of Chapter 42, Section 42-87 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of\nOrdinances, swimming pools and gates to be kept in a good state of repair, roof\nmaintained so as not to leak, exterior surfaces to be kept in a good state of repair,\nno conditions allowed which provides harborage for vermin and Chapter 18,\nSection 18-551, fences and gates for swimming pools to be not less than four (4)\nfeet in height and gates to be self-closing and self-latching.\n\nLead Code Enforcement Officer Walton advised he had broken the seven (7)\nviolations in this case down to two classifications, (A) which was violations 1,2\nand\n\n3, which concerned the pool and (B) which were violations 4, 5, 6 and 7. The\nviolator was out of compliance four (4) days for (A), violations 1, 2 and 3 for\nwhich the Town was requesting a fine of $100.00 a day for each of the four days\nout of compliance. The violator had been given until April 14, 2008 to come into\ncompliance for (B), violations 4, 5, 6 and 7 but these violations were still\noutstanding. The Town requests a fine of $250.00 a day commencing on April 15,\n2008 and continuing until compliance is achieved.\n\nAmy Fischer was present on behalf of the homeowner, along with Mr. Lawrence,\nan architect who she said was assisting them in trying to remedy the problems\nwhich had turned out to be more extensive than they had anticipated. She detailed\nthe problems with obtaining the proper roofer and the time frame involved. Some\nof the issues involved code changes and whether or not the roof could be replaced\nwith a similar system or whether it had to be upgraded to meet certain hurricane\nrequirements. Some of the issues had been taken care of immediately but it was\nnot feasible to remediate some of the problems in the time constraints the Town\nhad afforded them. Ms. Fischer requested this matter be continued for forty-five\n(45) days or they be given a forty-five (45) day window to come into compliance.\nShe said they had problems with contractors who had not done things in an\nexpeditious, correct manner.\n\nMr. Lawrence was sworn in by Recording Secretary Houston and said he had\nnothing to add other than that patching was not an option and the roof had to be\n\nreplaced. -\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016613",
