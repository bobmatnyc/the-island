The Ohio\nDepartment of Agriculture is reportedly ordering the “embargo” of products containing\nCBD, which has forced some businesses to remove products from store shelves.\n\nLike most states, Ohio has not yet set up regulations for hemp, which the 2018 Farm Bill\nrequires from each state before the manufacture and sale of certain hemp-derived\n\nproducts. In the meantime, CBD sales are technically limited to one of the Ohio’s 56\nlicensed dispensaries, under the state’s medical marijuana program.\n\n78 COWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024894",
