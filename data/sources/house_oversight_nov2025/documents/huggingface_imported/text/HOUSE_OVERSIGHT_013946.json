  "text": "scan and e-mail you everything that comes in, giving you the option of recycling/shredding junk, getting\na scan of the contents, or having specific items forwarded to you or someone you designate. I have not\npersonally used it yet (will be testing it out this month in preparation for an upcoming trip in May), but a\nfriend and author in Portland swears by them and knows the CEO. Seems they’ve gotten good press and\nthe idea seems far better than relying on friends/family who, if they’re anything like my friends/family ...\nwill surely drop the ball at some point:-).\n\n— NATHALIE\n\nI also use GreenByPhone.com to process checks electronically that come in through my Earth Class\nMail account—they charge $5 a check, but I live in San Diego, my Earth Class Mail office address is in\nSeattle, and I bank in Ohio. It works great!\n\n—ANDREW\n\nTo add to your excellent list (we’ve traveled just like that for several years SWEET?), I’d like to add\nmy modifications as a female traveler and a new mom (16-month-old baby). Personal favorites: (1)\nAthleta carries excellent, light, quick-dry clothing that hold up well to sports but still look very\nfashionable. Skorts are a must for looking feminine but being fully covered for hiking and steep pyramid\nsteps—you know what I mean, ladies! Just a note, a slightly longer length will serve you well in a lot of\ncountries, as well as tankini tops and swim skirts for swimming. (2) Fresh & Go toothbrush is simple to\nuse. (3) Marsona sound machine for drowning out unfamiliar noises is a must (regularly use with baby at\nhome too so when they hear the sound they know it’s sleep time!). This has been a lifesaver for us on\nmany trips, and we now use it regularly at home for better sleep. No more changing hotels midtrip to\navoid noise. AND, I know we have to travel light, but with baby a lot of things are nonnegotiable. These\nmake for smoother sailing: (1) Peanut shell sling in black fleece—it’s more comfy than the cotton and\nyou can pop baby in and out wherever you are, from birth to 35 Ibs. I never take mine off, it’s part of my\noutfit; (2) Peapod plus portable tent—this is baby’s main bed at home and travel so baby has the same\nsleep place everywhere we go, and the flaps give all travel parties privacy— great from small babies to\nfive-year-olds. I can still jam this onto a little wheeled carry-on and pack mine and baby’s minimal\nclothing around it; (3) Go Go Kidz TravelMate (great for wheeling car seat up to the gate for gate check\nor use on plane); (4) Britax Diplomat car seat is small but kids can use it from birth to approx. four years\nold.\n\nMake sure the wheeled carry-on bag you get is one size smaller than the allowed carry-on size so you\ndon’t get bumped to check the bag in if the plane is full. You can always nicely argue/reason/bat your\neyelashes that you will put the bag in your foot space. Also, very helpful to give baby something to sip\nor munch on during take off and landing so yours isn’t the baby screaming from ear pain. Happy travels!\n\n—KARYL\n\nPRE-EMPTING THE BOSS: COMMON CONCERNS ABOUT REMOTE WORK\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013946",
