  "text": "company may experience significant adverse effects, which in turn could negatively affect the\nperformance of the Fund. Moreover, the current regulatory framework may change or\nadditional regulations may arise at any stage during the product development phase of a\nportfolio company, which may affect the company’s ability to obtain approval of its products.\n\nThe Fund may invest in companies that will need to obtain patents for their products, both in\nthe U.S. and in other countries. The patent protection of the intellectual property of healthcare\ntechnology companies in many countries is highly uncertain and involves complex legal,\nscientific and factual issues. The policy regarding allowable claimed subject matter of life\nsciences or healthcare technology patents varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction.\n\nDependence on Single Products\n\nCompanies in which the Fund invests may only have one product under development. There\ncan be no assurance that the product will be approved for marketing by the FDA or any foreign\nregulatory agency. Further, competition to the product may develop from other new and\nexisting products. In either case, if a company is dependent on that one product, the\nconsequences of such failure could be devastating to the prospects of such company, which in\nturn could negatively affect the performance of the Fund.\n\nDependence on Reimbursement and Third-Party Pricing Policies for Products\n\nThe ability of the Fund’s portfolio companies to commercialize any product candidate\nsuccessfully also will depend in part on the extent to which reimbursement for these products\nand related treatments will be available from government health administration authorities,\nprivate health insurers and other organizations. Government authorities and third-party\npayors, such as private health insurers and health maintenance organizations, decide which\nmedications they will pay for and establish reimbursement levels. A major trend in the U.S.\nhealthcare industry and elsewhere is cost containment. Government authorities and third-party\npayors, particularly Medicare, have attempted to control costs by limiting coverage and the\namount of reimbursement for particular medications. Increasingly, third-party payors are\nrequiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined discounts from list prices and\nare challenging the prices charged for medical products. Portfolio companies cannot be sure\nthat coverage and reimbursement will be available for any product that they commercialize,\nand, even if these are available, the level of reimbursement may not be satisfactory.\n\nReimbursement may affect the demand for, or the price of, any product candidate for which a\nportfolio company obtains marketing approval. Obtaining and maintaining adequate\nreimbursement for a portfolio company’s products may be particularly difficult because of the\nhigher prices often associated with drugs administered under the supervision of a physician or\nbecause a drug may be administered in combination with other drugs that may carry high\nprices. A portfolio company may be required to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies\nto justify coverage and reimbursement or the level of reimbursement relative to other therapies.\nIf coverage and adequate reimbursement are not available or reimbursement is available only to\nlimited levels, a portfolio company may not be able to successfully commercialize any product\ncandidate for which it obtains marketing approval. This, in turn, could negatively affect the\nperformance of the Fund.\n\n59 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024070",
