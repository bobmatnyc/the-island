In fact, as I have repeated many times, the job was far far worse \nthat originally expected, you have a dedicated group of people trying to undo and damage you, including now, \nthey have started up in the last week full force again, as it is obvious that they can't fux with your wiki page \nany more as we blocked that.. The woman from the Daily Beast. We have programs that track this stuff, and \nso, for the past few days, Mike has been having a cyber war with her minions, who are actively trying to undo \nwhat we are doing, as she is trying to push her Daily beast and other articles back up. So, we have to go back \nand push them back down. \nThen, there was the issue of trying to create additionally on you a positive web presence, with the science and \norg sites. \nI spend literally four months of non-stop work, creativity, and my own political capital to getyou this so far, \nwhich saved you not only time, but countless dollars, and isn't something that can be readily bought. I had \npeople working also for free. I gained access to information that standard seo companies don't have. In \naddition, I wasted a lot of time talking to people who promise to help, but end up providing nothing, and so, I \nend up having to do it myself What do I get in return, constant back slapping to my head... \nWe were trying to fix up your mess. I didn't create it. Just thought it would be something to help. This was \nNEVER about trying to pull money out of you, and fact, we have don't everything possible to keep the costs \ndown considerably. \nI must talk to you about the island thing asap. When can we do that? \nFrom: Jeffrey Epstein <jeevacation@qmail.com> \nTo: Al seckel <aseckel@yahoo.com> \nSent: Thu, December 16, 2010 5:01:25 AM \nSubject: Re: Results \nI was never told never, that there was a 10k fee per month„ you inittaly said the project would take 20.. then \nanother 10. then another 10. . \nOn Wed, Dec 15, 2010 at 12:36 PM, Al seckel <aseckelgyahoo.com> wrote: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022226 \nJeffrey, \nThe hots did the sweep. Here are the new results taken as of a minute ago. You have only one negative article \nleft on front page of google, which is the Huffington Post article. The Huffington Post is extremely hard to \nmove, because it is so powerful, has millions of links to it, and uploads massive new and original content it on \na daily basis with posting from out side readers. We managed to push it down the page, as it used to be at the \ntop. If we were able to post original content to both the science and the org site (absolutely not a single word \nto this day by Jessica, just talk), we would have been able to push it down even further, and off the page. WE \ndid manage to get rid of the daily beast article, which is now far removed, inspite of their own efforts to keep \nit prominent. \nToxic suggested search engine terms that popped up automatically when you typed in your name are also now \nremoved. \nWikipedia was an important victory, as it will always be at the top of the search engine results. ow the head \nlines do not mention convicted sex offender or pedophile. Instead, Philanthrophic work, Epstein Foundation, \nPromotion of Scientists. We have stopped the hacking on your wiki site, and that was a major effor. Your \nwiki entry now is pretty tame, and bad stuff has been muted, bowlerized, and pused to the bottom. Careful \nediting and wording has muted the effect immensely. We hacked the site to replace the mug shot and caption, \nand now has an entirely different photo and caption. This was a big success. \nWe pushed the Edge all the way up to the front page, where it was previously buried on page 5 of google \nsearch. \nWe have promoted the other jeffrey epsteins, and other pages are also filled with your material. \nAnd, while the sites are up, and in the direction we hoped, they are still new, and subject to volitility, \nespecially if new original content is not added on a minimum of a weekly basis. I have been forbideen to add \nnew content to the philanthrophic site as well as the science site, and therefore, as a result our rating slipped \ndown (still on the first page, but would have liked them (and some of the articles to been able to push \nHuffington off page). We also helped with you images, and the first images that come of you on a google \nsearch are not of your mug shot, etc. \nYour daily beast foe is still at it, and trying to promote her sites against you in the same way that we try to \ndepromote you. \nAs far as this site is concerned, and the continuation of this, I do not know what you wish to do. Clearly, you \nhave no interest in my continuing. And, I am not sure if you want to continue the project at all. If the latter, \nand you stop, eventually it will just go into the way of entropy, and it will return to the old form. The major \nwork has been done, but it needs to be maintained. For it to get better results, it needs to have constant input \nand supervision, and that means generating proper content, not just editing and grammatical fixes. Writers \nneed to know what to write. THe philanthrophy site is at the bottom of the page precisely because you have \nnot allowed us to add any content to it, and as a result it suffers. \nYou paid Mike $2500, which he applied for the purchasing of his replacement servers, but his fee of $7500 \nbalance is now due if you want to continue. Please let me know what you want to do. I need to inform him, \nand if you are not going to use him, he needs to take on his other clients and devote his time there. \nThis needs to be contrasted with what we started with, which was a search on your name, which had nine/10 \nvery toxic prominent stories, and toxic Wiki article and headline. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022227 \nSearch Results \n1.
