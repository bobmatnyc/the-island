  "text": "Twelve Cognitive Processes That Underlie Learning 57\n\neasy and requires a level of abstraction that is very important to learn.\nMost creative thinking depends on this ability to abstract plans from\none field of knowledge to another. We learn to do this by practicing\nit. Teachers can help people see correspondences across domains. Ab-\nstraction of this sort is what creative people do best.\n\n3. Causation: Detecting what has caused a sequence of events\nto occur by relying on a case base of previous knowledge of\nsimilar situations (case-based reasoning)\n\nAll fields of knowledge study causation; biology, physics, history,\neconomics—they are all about what causes what. The fact that this is\nan object of study by academics tells us right away that it is not easy\nand no one knows for sure all of the causes and effects that there are\nin the world.\n\nBecause of this, acquiring a set of known causes and effects tends\nto make one an expert. A plumber knows what causes sinks to stop\nup and knows where to look for the culprit. A mechanic knows what\ncauses gas lines to leak and knows where to look. A detective knows\nwhat causes people to kill and knows where to start when solving a\nmurder case. Causal knowledge is knowledge fixed to a domain of\ninquiry. Experts have extensive case bases. Case bases are acquired by\nstarting on easy cases and graduating to more complex ones. It is im-\nportant to discuss with others the cases one works on because this\nmakes one better at indexing them in one’s mind, enabling one to\nfind them later as needed.\n\n4. Judgment: Making an objective judgment\n\nThere are two forms of this, both involving decisions based on\ndata. The first is deciding whether you prefer Baskin Robbins or Ben\nand Jerry’s. There is no right answer. We make judgments and then\nrecord them for use later. We find ways to express our judgments (Ben\nand Jerry’s is too sweet, for example). We learn what we like by trying\nthings out. A wine expert learns about wine by drinking it and record-\ning what he thinks so he can compare his thoughts about one wine to\nthose about a different wine later on.\n\nThe second form is reasoning based on evidence. A jury does this\nbut it doesn’t learn much from it. Judges, however, learn in this way,\nas do psychiatrists and businesspeople. They collect evidence, they\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023797",
