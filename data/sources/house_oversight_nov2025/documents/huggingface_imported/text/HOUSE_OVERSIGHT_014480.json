We flag to investors that we would consider reducing our weighting in\nthe event of no deal.\n\nAssuming OPEC does cut production and oil prices recover up to the high $50s per\nbarrel, as per our commodity strategists views, earnings and cash flows can recover\nsignificantly in the coming 12-18 months. Our Oil analysts model between 8 and 17%\nupside to operating cash flows in 2017 for European integrated stocks if assumed crude\nprices are increased $10 from $50 to $60. That makes the highest DY in market at ~6%\nmore sustainable out of FCF coverage.\n\nCautious UK domestic (underweight Retail, Travel & Leisure). We are cautious on\ndomestic UK exposure and underweight Retail and Travel & Leisure. To our mind, these\ncompanies face a lose-lose trade-off of maintaining margins by passing on higher costs\nat the expense of volumes, or face margin pressure by absorbing these costs in order to\nsustain current volumes. Building inflationary pressures point to a post-Christmas\nconsumer squeeze. This could be further compounded OPEC cuts and oil prices rise. The\nRetail sector is also facing structural margin pressures and unattractive valuations. In\nTravel & Leisure (two thirds UK listed), profitability is declining from peak levels. Note\nour analysts also see structural pressures on airlines from overcapacity and competition.\nSee below for more details.\n\nTable 4: European Sector Allocation\n\nIndex Index\nWeight Delta | Portfolio | Portfolio / Weight Delta | Portfolio | Portfolio /\nSector Ticker % Stance | (bp) | Weight % |Benchmark % |Sector Ticker % Stance | (bp) | Weight % |Benchmark %\nOi1&Gas SXEP 46 olw +150 6.1 132% Autos&Parts SXAP 3.2 n 0 3.2 00%\nHealthCare SXDP 12.5 olw +150 14.0 112% Banks SX7P 12.4 n 0 12.4 00%\nMedia SXMP 26 olw +100 3.6 138% BasicResou SXPP 3.0 n 0 3.0 00%\nUtilities SX6P 3.9 olw +100 49 125% Chemicals SX4P 5.0 n 0 5.0 00%\nConstr&Mtr SXOP 3.0 n 0 3.0 00%\nTrav&Leisr SXTP 1.8 ulw -150 0.3 15% FinServ SXFP 1.9 n 0 1.9 00%\nFood&Bevrg SX3P 5.9 ulw -150 4.4 75% InduGd&Ser SXNP 11.9 n 0 11.9 00%\nRetail SXRP 3.1 ulw -200 1.1 36% Insurance SXIP 64 n 0 64 00%\n100.0 +0 100.0 0% Per&HouGds SXQP 8.8 n 0 88 00%\nReal Estate SX86P 1.9 n 0 1.9 00%\nTechnology SX8P 3.8 n 0 3.8 00%\nTelecomm SXKP 41 n 0 44 00%\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nReflation rotation - tactically got very stretched\n\nOver the last two weeks we cut our weightings in Basic Resources and Banks to neutral.\nThat was in response to the signals from our technical models all flashing warning signs\nthat the rotation out of bond proxies into reflation beneficiaries had got very stretched\ntactically. Our Composite Technical Indicators (CTls) for sector relative performance hit\n+100 at the recent high in the case of Basic Resources and +94 for Banks and\nInsurance. These models combine a range of technical indicators including RSIs, MACDs,\nBollinger bands and others and +100 represents maximum overbought. Basic Resources\nrelative price has also reached +2.7SD above the 52-week average, the highest reading\nfor the sector since 2010. Financials hit +1SD while other cyclicals have also peaked at\n+1.5-2SD in recent weeks.\n\nBy contrast bonds and equity bond proxies screen as very oversold on these models. All\nDefensives troughed at -92 or below at some point over the last 4 weeks. On Bollinger\nscores, relative prices hit between -2.4SD and -3.8SD for the Defensives and also Real\nEstate. In the case of Utilities (-3.8SD) that is close to a record low. Similarly our CT|\nreadings for macro variables like 10-year Treasury yields, gold and S/yen also hit\noversold levels.
