I have spoken to a lot of ceos of fund outfits who say Saudis have been pulling billions of dollars in
separate account money -- not just from BR. And plus I cant believe they would have so much tied
up in lock ups.

most of the saudi money is tied up in pe funds. no withdrawals allowed . and im not seeing much in the
secondary market... blackrock is more money market , more like custodian than investor .

Interesting. CEO of big finance form told me that Saudis (SAMA) have withdrawn $200 billion
that has been parked with usual suspects over past year or so. That number seem in line with
what you know?

words that you to refer to one thing, USA. the stock market / the Royal family, . are no longer very
useful. In politics the USA meant the white house. now there is pentagon. cia, state, and congress
in addition, each feels empowered to act more independantly. stock market even in
tech, needs biotech, consuner tech. infrastrucrue tech. etc. same with Royal family, there are
20k members of a tribe. called the royal family, the words are misleading. if your article is
focused on bin salman, or the very top. no one is wondering where they can find the local
costco.. but they are aware that a message needs to be sent to their population , regarding the next 20
years,

social media, and the selfie crowds post the best of everything, their cutest pictures the amazing
food , the luxury resorts. the masses see these things and as the difference between
expectations and reality widen, the anger grows. trump has tapped in.

with the passage of the 9 11 saudi bill, unlike the french revolution where it was the people of france
that revolted against their own aristocracty, with the internet and globalization of discontect it is now
the americans that can revolt against the saudi leadership. _it is the americans that are demanding
women drive. not the saudis
