  "text": "emotional blocks, and we call them landmines.\n\nMy partner didn't hit the landmine on purpose. He wasn't trying to push me as hard as he\ndid. And I didn't warn him off. So the important question becomes -- how does one deal\nwith such a situation afterwards ?\n\n... \"I'm sorry,\" he said. \"I'm really sorry. I never want to do that to you again.\"\n\n\"It's okay,\" I said. \"These things happen. But please do be careful. But don't worry....\" I\ntrailed off, trying to find words.\n\nIt's so hard to know how to talk about this, especially with people who aren't used to\ndiscussing S&M. When there's a fuckup, sometimes both sides feel betrayed. The\nsubmissive might think: \"Maybe I didn't tell you exactly what to avoid, but sometimes it's\ntoo much to think about, sometimes it's hard to understand in the moment, sometimes I\ndon't know ahead of time. Okay, so I pushed myself too hard, but I did it because I'm so\ninto you, I did it because, in that moment, I lost track of myself. And anyway, I thought\nyou could read me. I thought you understood me. I thought you knew. You've read me\nperfectly well before; why not this time? Is it that you don't care?\"\n\nWhereas the dominant might think: \"Maybe I went too far, but I thought I could trust you\nto stop me. I thought I could trust you to tell me. I don't want to harm you, I just want to\npush you; I want to break down walls with you. I want to see your eyes go deep and soft.\nIt's not fair for me to feel like I fucked up, because you fucked up, too. I thought you\ncould take care of yourself. I thought you knew. You've communicated perfectly well\nbefore; why not this time? Can I rely on you?\"\n\nThat particular relationship didn't last, and I think that our most difficult encounter\nprobably affected our trust for each other through the end. Still, I can tell you how we\nworked on it at the time -- and I can tell you that it felt really good. We just listened to\neach other. And we both assumed that the other person had good intent. By the end of\ntalking it out -- which admittedly took a really long time; multiple days -- I trusted him\nmore than ever and I felt incredibly close to him.\n\nI've been thinking a lot about classic feminist anti-abuse models, which describe how\nabusers accomplish abuse. One of the tactics abusers consistently use is Minimizing,\nDenying, and Blaming their partners. Abusers claim that the abuse didn't happen; they\nclaim it wasn't important; they blame their partners for what happened. A partner who is\nwilling to listen and change will respond openly to criticism and to mistakes: a non-\nabusive partner will not minimize, deny, or blame.\n\nAnd those three things are what my ex-partner did not do. He never claimed that our\ndifficult encounter didn't happen; he never put the blame on me; he never insisted that it\nwas no big deal. He didn't even come close to doing those things while we talked it\nthrough. He took his emotions and dealt honestly with them, and I did my best to do the\nsame.\n\nAlso, in BDSM, we often talk about the concept of \"aftercare\": that is, what we say and\ndo after a BDSM scene to ground ourselves, bring ourselves back into the world, and\nconnect with our partners. It's important to give careful aftercare after any BDSM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018654",
