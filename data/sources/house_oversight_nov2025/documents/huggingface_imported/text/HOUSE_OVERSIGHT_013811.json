  "text": "thing, too, as I’m fired exactly one week later.\n\n2002-2003 BrainQUICKEN LLC has taken off, and I’m now making more than $40K per month\ninstead of $40K per year. The only problem is that I hate life and now work 12-hour-plus days 7 days a\nweek. Kinda painted myself into a corner. I take a one-week “vacation” to Florence, Italy, with my\nfamily and spend 10 hours a day in an Internet café freaking out. Sh*t balls. I begin teaching Princeton\nstudents how to build “successful” (1.e., profitable) companies.\n\nWinter 2004 The impossible happens and I’m approached by an infomercial production company and\nan Israeli conglomerate (huh?) interested in buying my baby BrainQUICKEN. I simplify, eliminate, and\notherwise clean house to make myself expendable. Miraculously, BQ doesn’t fall apart, but both deals\ndo. Back to Groundhog Day. Soon thereafter, both companies attempt to replicate my product and lose\nmillions of dollars.\n\nJune 2004 I decide that, even if my company implodes, I need to escape before I go Howard Hughes. I\nturn everything upside down and—backpack in hand—go to JFK Airport in New York City, buying the\nfirst one-way ticket to Europe I can find. I land in London and intend to continue on to Spain for four\nweeks of recharging my batteries before returning to the salt mines. I start my relaxation by promptly\nhaving a nervous breakdown the first morning.\n\nJuly 2004-2005 Four weeks turn into eight, and I decide to stay overseas indefinitely for a final exam\nin automation and experimental living, limiting e-mail to one hour each Monday morning. As soon as I\nremove myself as a bottleneck, profits increase 40%. What on earth do you do when you no longer have\nwork as an excuse to be hyperactive and avoid the big questions? Be terrified and hold on to your ass\nwith both hands, apparently.\n\nSeptember 2006 [ return to the U.S. in an odd, Zen-like state after methodically destroying all of my\nassumptions about what can and cannot be done. “Drug Dealing for Fun and Profit” has evolved into a\nclass on ideal lifestyle design. The new message is simple: I’ve seen the promised land, and there is good\nnews. You can have it all.\n\nStep I:\nD is for Definition\n\nReality is merely an illusion,\nalbeit a very persistent one .\n\n— ALBERT EINSTEIN\n\nCautions and Comparisons\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013811",
