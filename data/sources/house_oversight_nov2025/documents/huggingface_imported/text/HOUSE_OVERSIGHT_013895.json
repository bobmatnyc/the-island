  "text": "2. Which of the groups you identified have their own magazines?\n\nVisit a large bookstore such as Barnes & Noble and browse the magazine rack for smaller specialty\nmagazines to brainstorm additional niches. There are literally thousands of occupation- and\ninterest/hobby-specific magazines to choose from. Use Writer’s Market to identify magazine options\noutside the bookstores. Narrow the groups from question 1 above to those that are reachable through one\nor two small magazines. It’s not important that these groups all have a lot of money (e.g., golfers)— only\nthat they spend money (amateur athletes, bass fishermen, etc.) on products of some type. Call these\nmagazines, speak to the advertising directors, and tell them that you are considering advertising; ask them\nto e-mail their current advertising rate card and include both readership numbers and magazine back-\nissue samples. Search the back issues for repeat advertisers who sell direct-to-consumer via 800 numbers\nor websites—the more repeat advertisers, and the more frequent their ads, the more profitable a\nmagazine is for them ... and will be for us.\n\nStep Two: Brainstorm (Do Not Invest In) Products\n\nGenius is only a superior power of seeing.\n—JOHN RUSKIN, famed art and social critic\n\nPix the two markets that you are most familiar with that have their own magazines with full-page\nadvertising that costs less than $5,000. There should be no fewer than 15,000 readers.\n\nThis is the fun part. Now we get to brainstorm or find products with these two markets in mind.\n\nThe goal is come up with well-formed product ideas and spend nothing; in Step 3, we will create\nadvertising for them and test responses from real customers before investing in manufacturing. There are\nseveral criteria that ensure the end product will fit into an automated architecture.\n\nThe Main Benefit Should Be Encapsulated in One Sentence.\n\nPeople can dislike you—and you often sell more by offending some—but they should never\nmisunderstand you.\n\nThe main benefit of your product should be explainable in one sentence or phrase. How is it different\nand why should I buy it? ONE sentence or phrase, folks. Apple did an excellent job of this with the iPod.\nInstead of using the usual industry jargon with GB, bandwidth, and so forth, they simply said, “1,000\nsongs in your pocket.” Done deal. Keep it simple and do not move ahead with a product until you can do\nthis without confusing people.\n\nIt Should Cost the Customer $50-200.\n\nThe bulk of companies set prices in the midrange, and that is where the most competition is. Pricing low\nis shortsighted, because someone else is always willing to sacrifice more profit margin and drive you\nboth bankrupt. Besides perceived value, there are three main benefits to creating a premium, high-end\nimage and charging more than the competition.\n\n1. Higher pricing means that we can sell fewer units—and thus manage fewer customers —and fulfill\nour dreamlines. It’s faster.\n\n2. Higher pricing attracts lower-maintenance customers (better credit, fewer complaints/questions,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013895",
