  "text": "declassification request, consistent with established standards governing the handling of\nclassified information, including those under Section 3.1(d) of Executive Order 13526. Those\nstandards permit declassification when the public interest in disclosure outweighs any need to\nprotect the information. The White House review process also included input from the Office of\nthe Director of National Intelligence and the Department of Justice. Consistent with this review\nand these standards, the President has determined that declassification of the Memorandum is\nappropriate.\n\nBased on this assessment and in light of the significant public interest in the memorandum, the\nPresident has authorized the declassification of the Memorandum. To be clear, the\nMemorandum reflects the judgments of its congressional authors. The President understands\nthat oversight concerning matters related to the Memorandum may be continuing. Though the\ncircumstances leading to the declassification through this process are extraordinary, the\nExecutive Branch stands ready to work with Congress to accommodate oversight requests\nconsistent with applicable standards and processes, including the need to protect intelligence\nsources and methods.\n\nSincerely,\na1\n\nDonald F. McGahn II\n\nCounsel to the President\n\ncc: The Honorable Paul Ryan\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives\n\nThe Honorable Adam Schiff\nRanking Member, House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026249",
