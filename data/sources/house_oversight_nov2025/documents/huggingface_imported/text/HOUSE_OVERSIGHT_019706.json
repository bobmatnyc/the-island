In\nany case, the records of over nineteen million employees, including\nintelligence workers, became available to a hostile intelligence ser-\nvice. This breach would allow hostile services to obtain a great deal\nof information about independent contractors working at the NSA.\nThey could then use this data to follow the movements of any of\nthese intelligence workers they deemed of interest.\n\nDespite all the potential flaws in it, the outsourcing system contin-\nued in place. It even featured a revolving door through which Booz\nAllen hired retiring executives from the intelligence services, such\nas the former NSA director Michael McConnell; James Woolsey, a\nformer director of the CIA; and the retired general James Clapper,\nwho later served as director of national intelligence.\n\nThe cozy relationship between the private firms and the NSA\nnotwithstanding, the NSA leadership operated as if it were unaware\nthat outsourcing could create a security problem. As far back as\n2005 General Hayden, then the departing head of the NSA, had\nbeen warned of one such vulnerability in a memorandum written\n\n© by a counterintelligence officer at the NSA. Like the earlier 1996 ©\nreport by the threat officer, this memorandum noted the NSA had\nceded responsibility for managing its secret systems to outsiders and\nwarned that the NSA’s reliance on them to manage its computers\nhad opened a back door into the NSA. In addition, it warned that\nonce an outside contractor managed to slip in through this back door,\nhe could easily jump from one outsourcer to another. This was what\nSnowden did when he moved from Dell to Booz Allen Hamilton in\n2013.\n\nDespite its security flaws, outsourcing seemed to provide a num-\nber of advantages to the NSA. For one thing, it provided a means for\ncircumventing the budget restrictions imposed by Congress on hir-\ning new employees. In addition, because private companies had less\nrigid hiring standards, it greatly expanded the pool of young sys-\ntem administrators by tapping into computer cultures that would be\nantagonistic to working directly for the government. Finally, it drew\nless on NSA resources.
