  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nChapter 4: Beginning my life as an academic—and its changes over time\n\nI moved to Cambridge with my wife and two sons during the late summer of 1964. We rented an\napartment, first in Brookline and a year later in Cambridge.\n\nI began my teaching career at Harvard at the age of 25. Some of my students were older than I\nwas, and a lot more experienced. I was called the “Boy Professor.” It was intimidating and\n\nscary.\n\nPreparing for classes that I had never before taught was a full time job. When I began teaching in\n1964, the two “best” teachers were reputed to be Clark Byse and Ben Kaplan. I wanted to learn\nfrom the best, so I asked them if I could sit in on some of their classes to observe their teaching\ntechniques and styles. They both refused. Professor Kaplan asked me, rhetorically, whether I\n“allowed people to watch while you make love with your wife?” I replied, “of course not.” He\nsmiled and said “well, I make love with my students and don’t want anyone watching.” I was\ntempted to respond that if I had 160 wives and made love to them all at once, I wouldn’t even\nnotice if people watched, but I accepted his rebuke and had to figure out how to teach based on\ntrial and error. There were no classes at Yale Law School on how to teach law—and no\ninstruction books. For the first several years I did nothing but teach and write. It was a full time\njob, and I had no time for cases or other outside activities. That was soon to change, but not until\nafter I learned how to be a professor.\n\nMy first assignment was to teach the required first year course in criminal law. On my first day of\nteaching, I encountered 160 eager faces. The men were dressed in shirts and ties; the handful of\nwomen wore skirts. The teaching style of the day was Socratic, with the teacher posing difficult\nhypothetical questions based on cases the students were assigned from a case book. The\n“Socratic Method” came naturally to me because of my Talmudic background and argumentative\nnature. Right from the beginning I sensed that the traditional case books did not give the students\nan appropriate balance between the theory of law and its real world practice. I decided to write\nmy own case book, along with my criminal law mentor at Yale, Joseph Goldstein. I also decided\nto supplement my case book on a weekly basis with materials about contemporaneous\ndevelopments in the law. My goal was to keep the students current while also preparing them to\npractice, teach, judge or legislate about criminal issues until the end of their careers a half century\nhence. I also wanted to introduce my students to other disciplines—psychology, sociology,\neconomics, biology, literature—that would enrich their lives as lawyers. It was a daunting task,\nbut one that I approached with enthusiasm and eagerness. I rejected any sharp distinction\nbetween “theoretical” and “practical” approaches to teaching, believing that theory must be tested\nby practice, and that practice should be informed by theory. To this day, I bring my practice into\nthe classroom and my theory into the courtroom.\n\nI immediately loved teaching, particularly the Socratic exchange with my students. But I noticed\nthat even though several of my students were older than me (William Bennett was among them),\nmany of them were intimidated by the fact that I was the Professor. The “Paper Chase”\nprofessors were still the rule at Harvard and students were terrified of making a mistake. I\nwanted very much to loosen up the students and so I decided on a ploy. About a month into the\n\n0 Harvard Law Record, October 22, 1964, p. 3\n\n71\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017158",
