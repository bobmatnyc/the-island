  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nMazoltuv Borukhova\n\nIn February 2011, I argued the appeal of Mazoltuv Borukhova, whose murder conviction became\nthe basis of Janet Malcolm’s best seller, Iphigenia in Forest Hills: Anatomy of a Murder Trial.\nBorukhova, a young doctor who recently immigrated from Bukhara in the former Soviet Union,\nwas involved in a hotly contested divorce and custody suit with her dentist husband, who had also\nimmigrated from Bukhara. Mazoltuv was accused of hiring a cousin from the State of Georgia to\ncome up to Queens and murder her husband. She was convicted and sentenced to life\nimprisonment. The major issue on appeal was similar to the one that resulted in the reversal of\nSandra Murphy’s conviction, namely a hearsay statement, testified to by the murder victim’s\nfather, describing a statement allegedly made by the murder victim that suggested he feared being\nkilled by his estranged wife. The court ruled that this statement should not have been admitted\ninto evidence, but that the other evidence presented to the jury was so overwhelming, that the\nerror of admitting the hearsay was “harmless’”—that means that the jury would have convicted\nBorukhova even if they had never heard this inadmissible evidence. Appellate courts are not\nreally in a good position to evaluate what a jury would have concluded if certain evidence had\nbeen excluded. The case is now on habeus corpus.\n\n394\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017481",
