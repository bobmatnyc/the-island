That said by 2020, we believe the\nsales can surpass $400 mm, should the category increase its share of overall CBD to 7%\nby 2020. In the U.S., we estimate that the confection category (chocolate, non-chocolate\nand gum) grew to $25.5 bn in 2018, reflecting a 5.5% YoY growth rate. If we\nextrapolate that growth out over the next 2 years, the total implied confection market\nwould surpass $28 bn. A$420 mm CBD food category would reflect just a 1.5% share of\nthe total confectionary industry.\n\nFigure 90 Confectionary CBD Sales Can Surpass 400 MM By 2020 Figure 91 Extrapolating 5.5% Growth Results In Category Revenues\nSurpassing $28 BN In 2 Years\n\nU.S. CBD Confectionary Sales ($ in mm) 296 U.S. Confectionary Sales ($ in bn)\n$450 $420 , aad\n8400 I $28.0\nI $26.9\n$350 \\ $27.0\n300\n> | $26.0 $25.5\n$250 i\n$25.0\n9200 I $24.1\n9150 I §24.0\n7100 I $23.0\n$50 I\n$0 $22.0\n2018 2019E 2020E 2017 2018 2019E 2020E\nSource: Cowen and Company Source: IRI and Cowen and Company\n\nNote: 2018 sales reflect latest 52 weeks ended 3/25/18\n\nThe below sensitivity contemplates the overall revenue opportunity based on CBD\nconfections share of the overall category. While we believe a 1.5% share is reasonable\nand achievable, the revenue outcomes range from ~$100 mm to $700 mm based on the\nlevel of market share gains achieved over the next two years.\n\nFigure 92 We Believe Sales Can Range From Over $100 MM To ~$700 MM Based On Level Of Share\nCapture\n\n2020 Market Share Scenario Analysis\n\nMarket Share\n\nAbsolute Sales ($ in mm)\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nCOWEN.COM 49\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024865",
