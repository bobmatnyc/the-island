  "text": "Réssler’s generic chaotic system (see above) moving recurrently in a three\n\ndimensional box can be orthogonally decomposed into three directional motions in a\nmoving frame, each with a signatory sign of 2. The unstable direction of expansive\nstretching is characterized by some number > 0, A(+), the stable direction of\ncontractive folding, some number, < 0, A(-), and the neutrally stable direction of\nrecurrence, (0). For The “Lyapounov spectrum” of the Réssler attractor is\n[A(4), A(-),4(0)] (Shaw, 1981). An n-dimensional dynamical systems has n one-\ndimensional Lyapounov exponents, and it is sometimes the case in relatively noise\nfree, finite semi-stationary data lengths of the neurosciences, that a 2>0 can be\nshown to exist for a second one, in a dynamical situation called “hyperchaos” by\n(Rossler, 1979). For example, two and sometimes three 4(+) have been reported in\n\nthe flows on the EEG attractor of normal alert subjects (Gallez and Babloyantz,\n1991). The presence of measurement noise, the finiteness of neurophysiological\nsample lengths as well as the relatively small expansive actions in some directions\n\nin the chaotic attractors of brain dynamics lead to the finding that most often, only\none “leading Lyapounov exponent,” 4(+), is reliably computable (Sano and\n\nSawada, 1885; Wolf et al, 1985; Eckmann et al, 1986).\n\nA counter-intuitive fact about the stability of a dynamical system when a\ndecrease in the value of 4(+)is observed such that 2(+)—> A(0), is that this more\nneutral stability augers a global bifurcation (Guckenheimer and Holmes, 1983). A\nsmall perturbation does not change the global dynamics of an already expanding\nand contracting (called “hyperbolic”) dynamical system, it will maintain the style of\nits motions. However, when 4(+)—> 1(0), a velocity changing perturbation evokes a\nbifurcation to a new dynamic in what is called “loss of hyperbolic stability.” The best\nexamples come from the observations of this kind of change in the EEG predicting\nthe onset of epileptic seizures in patients with focal or temporal lobe epilepsy\n(lasemidis et al, 1988,1990; lasemidis and Sackellares, 1996 ).\n\n219\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013719",
