  "text": "Mind over Computer 45\n\nyou if this crowd-sourced random\nnumber generator really works.\nThere should be no way to predict\nthe resulting number as both\nof you are affected by quantum\nrandomness and, provided you\nwait a little before shouting stop,\nany social stereotyping should\nbe overcome. If you want to be\nscientific, remember the random\nnumber you started with and the\nlength of time before your friend\nshouted stop. There should be an\nimprovement in randomness with\nthe amount of time they wait.\n\nIn the absence of human\ninteraction another way to give\na computer access to a random\nnumber is from a quantum\ndevice. A lava lamp works well!\nThe Lavarand, developed by\nSilicon Graphics, is a hardware\nrandom number generator which\nuses images of a lava lamp to seed\na random number generator. It is\ncovered by U.S. Patent 5,732,138, fave Lamp\ntitled “Method for seeding a pseudo-random number generator with a\ncryptographic hash of a digitization of a chaotic system.’ Got that!\n\nA computer does not acquire free will just through the injection of\nrandomness. You could simply put an intercept on the link from the lava\nlamp to the computer and completely predict the computer’s behavior.\nThe system as a whole will certainly do unpredictable things, but the\ncomputer did not make a choice; behaving randomly is not exercising\nfree will. Where is the will?\n\nConsciousness\n\nI remember my first trip to Death Valley in the United States. We were\ndriving along the main east-west highway at the bottom of the valley\nand a sign said, “Turn off your air conditioning now.’ I did as I was told\nand to cool down I opened the window. When I put my hand out I felt\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015735",
