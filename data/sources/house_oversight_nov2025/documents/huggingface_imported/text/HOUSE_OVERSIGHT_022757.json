There was no ultimate goal. It\nwas just fun to meet smart people, interesting people. But no long-range\nplans. Often no short-term plans either. I would head to Kennedy and, on the\ntheory that most important events in one’s life are serendipitous, I wouldn’t\ndecide where I was going until I got there.”\n\nAt the same time, he is developing a perception, or, at least a market\ndifferentiation: the hyper wealthy had different problems than the very\nwealthy. Dealing with a billion dollars was different from dealing with $100\nmillion:\n\n“Tf you had a billion dollars I would think the last thing you should be\nworried about was money, in truth money was what you most worried about.\nHow to make more of it, how to give away more of it, how to protect you\nchildren from it, how to hide it from your wife or husband, how to minimize\nyour taxes on it. The traditional wealth service structure, an accountant, and\ninvestment advisor, a personal lawyer, and an idiot brother-in-law, became\nhopelessly outdated as amounts exponentially increased.\n\n“You can’t spend a billion dollars, you can just reallocate it to a\ndifferent investment class. And you can’t give away a billion dollars without\na vast staff, in effect going into the business of giving away money, yet\nanother business you are likely to know little about.”\n\nAt just about this point in the narrative, the questions or the\nincredulity begins in social circles and eventually in the media. He begins to\nacquire the major symbols of riches but does this without position, public\nholdings, or obvious paper trails. How can a person have enough money to\nmerit increasing attention, but no clear way of having gotten it? Epstein gets\nstuck in that tautology. He may be rich, but he is without institutional\nprotection or bona fides. He is a questionable substrata of wealth. He’s a\nfreelancer.\n\nThat’s the rub: he doesn’t work for anyone. Without institutional\ncredentials he’s... well, nobody knows what.\n\nFor a period, one part of his activities he says is recovering monies for\ncountries looted by exiled dictators or military strongmen. If early in his\ncareer he might seem like a sort of George Peppard (there’s a physical\nresemblance) in Breakfast at Tiffany’s, a charming hustler, later he’s George\nPeppard in Banacek, a smart and astute operator.\n\nThen, in his telling, he’s representing a series of vastly wealthy people\nand families. He’s not just doing their bidding or their investing, he’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022757",
