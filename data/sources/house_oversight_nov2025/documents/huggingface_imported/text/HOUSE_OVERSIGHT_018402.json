  "text": "fracturing of ancient China during the Spring and Autumn era or in the Roman\nEmpire in the age of the Caesars. Our current shifting — that tap, tap on every\nnation’s politics, media, and economics - isn’t really so unpredictable after all. 242\n\nYou may know the old saw of military parade evaluation: That the more magnificent\na nation’s uniforms are the weaker it’s army usually is. But the gold-braided\nadmirals of some three-ship navy reflect a very human need for security, and\nparticularly for a self-decided feeling of security. Every nation has it’s own foreign\naffairs aims. Each cherishes a certain national image, memories of military glory and\nof “interests” inseparable from culture or identity. The goals of the French and the\nTurks, for instance, each evoke an encyclopedia of history, tradition and politics.\nUneasiness in Paris about capitalism and immigration, for instance; or Anrka’s\nworry about ethnic division, fundamentalisms, and the creeping nuclear progress of\ntheir neighbors. Our era’s revolutionary logic will shape choices in every nation\ndifferently. But I'd like here to discuss American foreign policy. America plays a\ncentral role in world order now. The country’s leading position makes her, to some\ndegree, an unavoidable gatekeeper. In the Napoleonic era, nearly every revolution\nor war could be tied to energies emanating from Paris. During the Cold War most\npuzzles of politics or geography might be framed in terms of a zero-sum competition\nwith the USSR. In our own age, we'll find most every problem links to networks and\ntheir new logic. And - for now at least - to America. Thomas Paine’s memorable 250\nyear-old assessment, that “The cause of America is the cause of all mankind,”\ntouches this linked universalism in a way he never could have imagined.\n“Betweeness” or “Centrality” are the way network science labels and measures such\na role. Just how essential is a certain nation or trading platform or point? The\nnetworks of America won't, in the future, be the only networks. They will be less\n“between”. But they will be, always and indelibly, the first reference for design.\n\nIf the traditional aim of American foreign policy was to prevent the emergence of a\nchallenger that threatened the country directly, or that might fence off and\nmanipulate Asia or Europe or Latin America against Washington’s aims, the concern\nnow is different: Mastery of topological destiny. There are those who observe, as an\nAmerican think tank noted in 2015, “Today the United States faces no existential\nthreat.”243 This is wrong. The emergence and shape of networks is just such a\ndanger. Security, the great foreign policy theorist Andre Wolfers once wrote, is “the\nabsence of threats to acquired values.”244 The networks around us, as we've seen,\nare demolishing older values. Often because we want them to. Any revolutionary\ntechnology unbuttons an older order this way. But we now approach this\ndestabilized world with a sort of wideyed panic. Control terrorism, manage climate\n\n242 Our current shifting: See also Lars-Erik Cederman, T. Camber Warren, and\nDidier Sornette, “Testing Clausewitz: Nationalism, Mass Mobilization, and the\nSeverity of War” International Organization 65, Fall 2011, pp 605-38\n\n243 “America faces no existential threat”: See James Dobbins, et al. Choices for\nAmerica in a Turbulent World (Santa Monica: RAND Corporation, 2015) xiv\n\n244 In his classic essay: Andre Wolfers, “National Security’ as an ambigious\nsymbol”, Political Science Quarterly, 67 (1952) 485\n\n170\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018402",
