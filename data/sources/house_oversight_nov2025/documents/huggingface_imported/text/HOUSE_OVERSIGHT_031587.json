  "text": "coordination with China on the issue.” Could the influence of Western\npowers in the region be weakened, for the benefit of China? All these\nconcerns come back to one issue: China’s new role within the\ninternational community. As a new — and still growing — power, some\nobservers fear that China may soon have the ability to challenge and\nthreaten the Western liberal model that has dominated international\norganizations since the end of the Cold War.\n\nThe Reality\n\nThese concerns are misplaced. First, the Chinese Communist Party (CCP)\nhas a high level of suspicion toward Western proposals at the international\nlevel and within the executive organs of the United Nations in particular.\nChina seems to view the UN as a potential tool to oppose what it considers\nWestern interventionist policies around the world, and it is clear that the\nChinese government was greatly disappointed when the United States and\nits allies acted on their own to impose, by force, a regime change in Iraq in\n2003. The frustration was even greater during the Libyan crisis that ended\nwith the overthrow and execution of former leader Muammar Gaddafi.\nIndeed, from Beijing’s perspective, resolution 1973 of the United Nations\nseeking to impose a no-fly zone in Libya did not give any foreign power\nthe right to intervene militarily on Libyan territory and against the Libyan\nregime. Beijing learned a lesson. The second element may be more\nimportant: Beijing’s stance on the Syrian crisis is consistent with China’s\nlong-term foreign policy and its fundamental principles. The basis of\nChinese foreign policy is articulated in the Five Principles of Peaceful\nCoexistence, enunciated by Zhou Enlai in 1954: 1) mutual respect for\nsovereignty and territorial integrity; 2) mutual non-aggression; 3) non-\ninterference in each other’s internal affairs; 4) equality and mutual benefit;\nand 5) peaceful coexistence in developing diplomatic relations and\neconomic and cultural exchanges with other countries.\n\nSince the opening of the country under Deng Xiaoping in 1978, Chinese\nforeign policy can be more generally characterized as pragmatic.\nPragmatism and the five principles are the key to understanding China’s\nresponse to the Syrian crisis and indeed its general approach to foreign\nrelations.
