  "text": "change, lock in great-state peace. So many desires scatter our minds and when we\nfail to achieve them they erode our will. Here is a basic lesson of accomplishment in\nany human domain: Better for us to focus on a single aim, and tighten our efforts\naround that one aim and use success to strengthen our will. The answer to the great,\nnewly-charged existential question of politics - “Are you a gatekeeper or the\ngatekept?” - is not yet decided for the United States. So, strategy first: We live ina\nconnected age where power is sliding into that gated order we've learned about.\nAmerica’s role? Not to make the entire world democratic. Not to try to bomb or\nforce stability onto every nation now collapsing under network pressures. Not to\npassively wait for our version of history to “win”. Not to thwart the rise of other\ncountries. No. The strategy that fits the nature of our age and position is to perfect\nand then operate the essential, topological mechanisms of power now. Sometimes\nwith warm humanity; other times with the ruthlessness demanded by the touch of\ndanger and evil. This involves gates. It involves firmness and nerve and willpower. It\ndemands what we might call Hard Gatekeeping.\n\n2.\n\nEverything around us now is or soon will be connected. Access to our trade, the use\nof technology and networks, our defense or our currency - all of these must be\nconsidered as gated systems. Each will come to throb with new power as a result of\ntheir links, as a byproduct of their escalating sensitivity, intelligence and power, and\nfrom that in-or-out distinction. Much remains to be instantly, fully linked in this\nway. Our education. Our medicine. Our military. Real-time information, sensors and\nmachine intelligence will erect Gatelands in each of these areas and in others. These\nwalls will go up even faster than real-world berms and fences. The strategic position\nof any nation or terror group or business is not going to be secured by industrial\nmeasures. No one at Google wants to build a newspaper. No one in Al-Qaeda is\ntrying to float an aircraft carrier. Rather, it will be determined in the construction of\nnew tools, which largely means the building of a new, gated order.\n\n“Every new age and every new epoch in the coexistence of peoples,” the historian\nCarl Schmitt once wrote, “is founded on new spatial divisions, new enclosures, and\nnew spatial orders of the earth.” Schmitt was contemplating history: The great\nMediterranean empires and the long, millennial power trails of Asian chieftains. But\nhis insight touches every age, our own included. To make a nation, to build an\nempire, is to draw lines, to push at borders, to smash at gates. Some of this is the\nwild martial ambition of a Napoleon or Hitler (who Schmitt unwisely advised); often\nitis simple protection. Lord Balfour, serving as Foreign Secretary, contemplated this\nproblem from his imperial vantage in 1918 and observed: “Every time I come toa\ndiscussion - an intervals of say, five years — | find there is a new sphere we have got\nto guard,” he wrote. “Those gateways are getting further and further away from\nIndia, I don’t know how far west they are going to be brought by the General\nStaff.”245 This problem of where exactly to put the gates confronts us now as well.\n\n245 “Those gateways”: Quoted in Robert Jervis, “Cooperation Under the Security\nDilemma”, World Politics Vol 30, Issue 2 (Jan, 1978) p. 169\n\n171\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018403",
