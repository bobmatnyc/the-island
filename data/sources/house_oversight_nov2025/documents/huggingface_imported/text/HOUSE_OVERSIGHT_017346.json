  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\n“Because victims of sexual crimes are likely to suffer a ‘depth and range of emotion and\npsychological disturbance. ..not felt by the victims felt by most other crimes’ we remind\nlawyers and judges that the mere fact that such victims sought counseling may not be used\nfor impeachment purposes.”\n\nNotwithstanding this warning, it seems quite likely that at least some rape victims would decline\nto press charges if they knew that their treatment records could be rummaged through by defense\nlawyers eager to discredit them.\n\nThe feminist lawyer, who successfully argued the appeal, had mixed feelings about the results,\nacknowledging that she “had hurt the cause,” and that her victory for her client was “a step back\nfor women.” But she understood that her responsibility in this case was to this defendant, rather\nthan to future rape victims who she cared deeply about but who were not her clients. She did her\njob, and she did it well.\n\nThis is another example of the “no free lunch” doctrine, in which doubts were resolved in favor of\ndefendants and against the victims of rape.\n\n259\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017346",
