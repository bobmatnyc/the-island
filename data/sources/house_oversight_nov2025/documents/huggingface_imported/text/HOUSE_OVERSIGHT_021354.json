  "text": "In this hierarchy one member—the\nhuman—had stepped beyond its\nassigned place in the cosmic society and\nnow lived in an unwitting complacency,\nignoring the precarious finitude of a life\nbeing pursued by a radical judgment:\n“tis nothing but [God’s] hand that holds\nyou from falling into the fire every\nmoment: ’tis to be ascribed to nothing\nelse, that you did not go to hell the last\nnight; that you was suffered to awake\nagain in this world, after you closed your\neyes to sleep: And there is no other\nreason to be given, why you have not\ndropped into hell since you arose in the\nmorning, but that God’s hand has held\nyou up.”\n\nLike his contemporaries, the\ndeists and religiously inclined scientists\nsuch as Newton himself, Jonathan\nEdwards assumed the “Newtonian world\nmachine,” operating with the\nmetronomic regularity of natural law.\nPresupposing both the science and the\naristocratic social hierarchy of his day,\nEdward introduced anthropomorphic\nlanguage to create a clash between this\nharmonious order and the willful self-\ninterest of humans who dared to ignore\ntheir proper rung on the ladder of\nexistence. As a preacher of penitence,\nhe carried his anthropomorphic imagery\nto extravagant heights in order to induce\na reversal of behavior in a recalcitrant\ntown. The sermon effectively threatened\nthe people of Enfield with what\namounted to “metaphysical ostracism,”\nan expulsion no less thoroughgoing than\nthe primordial ejection of Adam and Eve\nfrom the garden. The palpable effect of\nthis imagery depended on the evocation\nof the natural and social orders rising up\nlike, and yet unlike, an angry monarch to\ncrush rebels against the cosmic\ncommonwealth.\n\n108\n\n_\nQ\n\nPage\n\n&\n\n¢\n\nReferences\n\n\"Tn the interests of clarity, I have\nslightly rearranged and modernized this\nquotation.
