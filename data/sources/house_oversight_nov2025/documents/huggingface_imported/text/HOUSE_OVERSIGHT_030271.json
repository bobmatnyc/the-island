  "text": "have an unrepresentative Parliament writing an unrepresentative\nConstitution,” argued Mohamed ElBaradei, the former international\natomic energy czar who is running for president on a reform platform.\n“Because the Muslim Brotherhood is ready, they want elections\nfirst,” adds Osama Ghazali Harb, another reform party leader. “We as\nsecular forces prefer to have some time to consolidate our parties. We\nmust thank the army for the role it played. But it was our revolution,\nnot a coup d’état. ... If there are fair elections, the Muslim\nBrotherhood will only get 20 percent.”\n\nFree elections are rare in the Arab world, so when they happen,\neverybody tries to vote — not only the residents of that country. You\ncan be sure money will flow in here from Saudi Arabia and Qatar to\nsupport the Muslim Brotherhood.\n\nAmerica, though, cannot publicly intervene in the Egyptian election\ndebate. It would only undermine the reformers, who have come so\nfar, so fast, on their own and alienate the Egyptian generals. That\nsaid, though, it is important that senior U.S. officials engage quietly\nwith the generals and encourage them to take heed of the many\nEgyptian voices that are raising legitimate concerns about a\npremature runoff.\n\nIn short, the Egyptian revolution is not over. It has left the dramatic\nstreet phase and is now in the seemingly boring but utterly vital phase\nof deciding who gets to write the rules for the new Egypt. And how\nEgypt evolves will impact the whole Arab world. I just hope the\nObama team is paying attention. This is so much more important than\nLibya.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030271",
