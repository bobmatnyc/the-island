FOLLOW RAW STORY! \nLast fall's allegations of sexual assault against President Donald Trump failed to stop his \npresidency, but one of the more explosive of those allegations is once again making headlines. \nPOLITICO reported that a new lawsuit reveals details linking Trump to billionaire \npedophile Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted sex offender. The reports indicate that one lawsuit \ncontains information about Virginia Giuffre who alleges that she met Epstein while working as \na towel girl at Mar-a-Lago when she was 15 before being recruited into \"sexual slavery\". \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022980 \nGiuffre's case is set to appear before a judge on May 15, and although her accusations against \nEpstein have been public for some time, this is the first time the detail about her employment \nat Mar-a-Lago has been included. \nLast summer, the Trump-Epstein connection made headlines when Trump was slated to win \nthe Republican nomination, and just before the election, a woman came forward alleging that \nTrump raped her when she was 13 at one of Epstein's parties — only to drop suit a few days \nlater. \nIn 2015, Trump lawyers denied claims of the then-candidate's involvement with Epstein by \nsaying their only relation was that Epstein was \"one of thousands of people who has visited \nMar-a-Lago\". Those claims that fly in the face of a 2002 New York Magazine interview in \nwhich Trump claimed to have known Epstein for 15 years. \n\"He's a lot of fun to be with. It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and \nmany of them are on the younger side. No doubt about it — Jeffrey enjoys his social life,\" \nTrump told reporters. \nReiort los and corrections to corrections@rawstor .com \nNEXT ON RAW STORY > \nGleeful Democrats see Trumpcare as political suicide for House GOP: \n'They are staring death in the face' \nBy commenting, you agree to our terms of service and to abide by our commenting policy. \nREAD COMMENTS - JOIN THE DISCUSSION \nNEW STORIES \nObamacare \n______How one US state is leading the charge to dismantle \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022981 \n• \nfor House GOP: 'They are staring death in the face' \n• \nKimmel test' to win his su \nort \n• \nspills onto a Missouri school playground \nas political suicide \nill must pass 'Jimmy \nchurch and state \n• blem crushing \nthe poor and sick to help the ultra-rich \nRaw Story \nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nGet the best of Raw Story, delivered daily \nTop of Form \nEmail Address \nSIGN UP \nBottom of Form \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022982 \nTRUMP NEWS \nObamacare \nare starin \ndeath in the face' \nfor House GOP: 'The \n- \nTrump \nbacklash \nHow ing I arge to dismantle \nare as political suicide \n2 he GOP health bill \nad a message for \no received online \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022983 \n• \nPope \nLi \nKimmel test' to win his su \nwhite teacher who insists on \n• \n`unnecessar \nof Tru 'onship with the \nill must pass 'Jimmy \n': Watch a black teen confront his \np actions — le for its \n•ty of the \nGOP health care bill are deplorable'  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022984 \n• \nMeyers hilariously taunts a White House 'detached from reality' \npicer': Seth \nSEE ALL RAW STORIES \nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER \nGet the best of Raw Story, delivered daily \nTop of Form \nEmail Address SIGN UP \nBottom of Form \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022985",
