  "text": "All I can say about Bill’s message on Monday is: “Amen, brother! Amen!”\n\nHe hit every nail right on the head.\n\nTo those self-deluding worthies who think that a Donald Trump\npresidency will solve all of America’s problems I say, “Get your heads\n\nout of your collective a***s, because it ain’t gonna happen.”\n\nTrump will continue the policies (if we can laughably call them such) of\nthe Deep State... with a dash of Adolph Hitler thrown in for good\n\nmeasure. Clinton will be no better, if not worse.\n\nI’m with Bill — a vote for the lesser of two evils is still voting for evil.\nHowever, unlike him, I will vote, but for a third-party candidate who\ndoesn’t have a snowball’s chance of winning. A “wasted” vote is better\n\nthan a vote for Trump or Hillary.\n\n— Dale A.\n\nI think you are correct in your assessment of the Deep State. I disagree\n\nin how to deal with it.\n\nIt seems easy for the rich or the poor to walk away and state it doesn’t\nmatter. The poor because they do not have a choice; the rich because\nthey do. For those of us in the middle we need to deal with it, lest we\nend up in the poor camp. For me, a decision that includes a less bad\n\nscenario is still a decision worth pursuing.\n\n— Rudy R.\n\nIn Case You Missed It...\n\nThe third part of Doug Casey’s “virtual workshop” on how to turn crises into\n\nwildly profitable investments goes live today.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028798",
