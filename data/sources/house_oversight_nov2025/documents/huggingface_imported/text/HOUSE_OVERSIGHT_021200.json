  "text": "Jeffrey wanted his evening massage before bed and Ghislane and\nEmmy went to their office to talk about something, leaving our guest of\nhonor to find company elsewhere. Strolling into the darkness with two\nbeautiful girls around either arm, Bill seemed content to retire for the\nevening. He wanted to have a hot bath before bed while I began the\nmassage in the tub. Starting with his feet and calves, he wanted to end the\nnight quickly. Never showing any restraint he sat up on the edge of the\ntub and asked me to preform on him orally. I did my job, but that’s all our\nrelationship was these days, a dreadful job. Getting it over and done with\nas quick as possible was my hope but I couldn’t let him pick up on those\nvibes, to make him enticed I had to act like his little porn star, knowing\nexactly how he wanted it. Only then would my duties be fulfilled and I\nwould be able to get back the reality of my complicated life. Before I\ncould say goodnight, Jeffrey had one more request. He wanted me to tuck\nhim under the blankets and fluff his pillows for him. Then I had to reach\nunder the covers and massage his feet while watching him fall asleep, he\neven wanted me to wait like twenty minutes or so after he fell asleep\nbefore | could leave. It wasn’t unusual for him to ask it but God I hated it,\nnever offering it | would always wait for him to request it. Once he was\nsnoring gently I wiped my hands clean of the lotion and quietly closed the\ndoors to his room. Making my way up the outdoor spiraling staircase, I\nfelt the breeze blow through my hair and looked up to the heavens. The\nstars shown so bright out here in the middle of nowhere with no big city\nlights to hinder their effect I could get lost in time staring into them. No\nmatter how far gone I really felt there was always something about a\nsimple caress from the wind or the reflection of the star sweeping sky in\nthe black glossy ocean that would always remind me of my fond love of\nnature’s blessings.\n\nBack in New York, there was nothing left of nature to adorn. It was a\ndwelling for those who no longer saw the use for trees without cages or\nblue skies without clouds of man made fumes and gases. Unfortunately if\nwe weren’t in the Caribbean, we were there in New York. Hardly going\nback to Palm Beach, barely even seeing my family, my dog or T.J these\ndays at all. In my parents heads I was all grown up and educated in the\nworld of wealth not needing them any longer they would just wait for my\ncall once in a while to let them know how I was doing and that was the\nextent to our restricted relationship. The road my life has led down never\nhas kept me close to home anyways so to me it wasn’t anything\nunordinary but still a sad existence to be without a family of my own. It\nwould’ve been nice to be missed though, rarely letting myself think like\nthat. No room for pity in my heart, if I did, the floodgates could open and\nI'd have enough grief in one lifetime to go around a few times that they\nwould’ve never been closed.\n\n111\n\nJ Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL - GIUFFRE004244\n\nJeffrey’s business was running well from the looks of his attentiveness\nthe office he owned in the Upper East Side of Manhattan. Alan\nDershowitz, his colleague in finances and personal solicitor, a bird of the\nsame feather, I had seen hanging around the island and Jeffrey’s\nManhattan mansion, more and more these days. Alan’s taste for the\nyoung and beautiful was a bias for a blooming business relationship\nbetween him and Jeffrey. After an explicit session of Jeffrey’s vulgar\npilgrimage into my body, we were interrupted by a knock at the door by\nJeffrey’s good friend, Alan. I wrapped myself up in Jeffrey’s pink bed\nsheets, which is the color preference he chose to sleep in because it\nreminded him of the same color of his own words Pussy”, and covered\nmy face from the unexpected intrusion. Jeffrey got up and wrapped a\ntowel around his loins and answered the door completely calm. Opening\nthe bedroom door and letting Alan inside they began to converse about\nbusiness immediately, right in front of me. Jeffrey started to tell Alan\nwhat needed to be done while he jostled some notes down quickly. |\npeeked my head from underneath the covers thinking they were too\nwrapped up in their work to notice me get up and dressed, and Jeffrey\nturned back to me and told me to just stay there this would only take a\nsecond. Going back to Alan he turned his focus back into work and\nhustled out a few more orders before letting Alan out of the door and\nreturning his attention to me.\n\n“Sorry about that, work never stops and neither will the money coming\nin. How else am | going to make a million dollars while I’m sleeping?”\nJeffrey chuckled as he sat back down on the bed next to me. | laughed at\nhis humorous and mostly true statement, then a strand of hair fell in front\nof my face. Before L could get to it he put it back behind my ears and\nsweetly stroked my face, for a moment we just looked into each other’s\neyes and he nearly seemed almost human to me. It was bizarre how he\ncould be so kind and gentle one moment and the second beforehand | was\nbeing treated like no more than a common plaything left out for display.\nNothing more than an ego trip, Jeffrey got off on letting the ones he\nwanted to know that he could own anything and anyone he wanted in this\nworld. Maybe for a brief minute I believed the sincerity behind his eyes\nbut that vision would quickly fade away and I would be left second-\nguessing why I even fell for his deceitful tricks for a moment.\n\nJeffrey got up from the bed and asked me to join him for a shower. In\nhis bedroom, which was the entire top floor, he had a glass shower\nenclosed underneath a glass skylight right in the middle of the room. It\nwas perfectly accessible feature for a man that loved both being clean and\nnude, but still an odd feature at that. As I always did whenever 1\nshowered with him, | lathered a loofa with soapsuds and would scrub his\nbody, up and down, in between his toes, even behind his ears and of\n\n1 Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUTVRE004245\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021200",
