  "text": "and the secret to vigor and longevity. “...to achieve fullness of life one had to abide\nin empty nothingness, xuwu.” In Lao-Tsu’s Tao-Te-Ching, “...the Way is gained by\ndaily loss, loss upon loss until...by letting go, it all gets done...”\n\nWilliam James, in The Principles of Psychology, tried to capture the subjective\ndynamics of the brain as an on-going preconscious stream of statistical wave\nprocesses. He envisioned autonomously increasing and decreasing coherence\nemerging spontaneously and from sensorial evoked thoughts via the confluence\n\ntt\n\nand disaggregation of statistical wave processes, “...wave crests and hollows...”\nthat achieved temporary statistical stability by “...feelings of relation, consubstantial\nwith our feelings or thoughts of the terms between which they (only temporarily)\nobtain.” In the more receptive, higher entropy brain systems, fleeting forms change\nwithout continuity, Jumping from one to another with “magical rapidity,” but being not\nalready engaged, are available for use for self-organized structure evoked by new\ninformation. Without ordered, low entropy, preconceived ideational defects in the\nresting random brain field, the full attentional statistical machine is available to\nsensitively respond in self-organized, quasi-stable states of cognitive, conative and\naffective integration. They then disappear; this brain relaxes quickly, ready for new\nexperience. This contrasts with those brains that are dominated by islands of order\ncomposed of personality fixations and rigid belief systems, low entropy defects,\n\nwhich interfere with sensorially responsive sel/f-organization.\n\n68\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013568",
