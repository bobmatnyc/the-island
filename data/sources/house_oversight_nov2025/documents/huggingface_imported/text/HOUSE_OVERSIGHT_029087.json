[jeevacation@gmail.com]\nSubject: Greetings from Japan\n\nImportance: — High\nHey Jeffrey,\nThought I'd check in and see what's up on your end.\n\n- I've been watching closely Trump's appointees and there, he might be putting Balaji (a big bitcoiner)\nas FDA head, and Allison seems to be somewhat in favor of something like Bitcoin. And of course,\nThiel has said that Bitcoin is what Paypal should have been... Curious to hear where your head is at\non this matter.\n\n- Last week, | presented my research at Stanford's BPASE, it was well received. The most interesting\nthing | came up with for that is an inverse-input contract; i.e., funds that are \"locked\" to be spent only\nin the case where there are other funds that are not used in a specific way. An example of something\nthat could be built with this: a matching donation contract, where you agree to donate your money to\n\ncharity if someone else donates to charity, and you would not be able to release your funds from that\nagreement until they use their funds not for charity.\n\n- I'm in Japan this week, teaching a class to 100 Japanese Engineers to get the up to speed on\nbitcoin (with DG). It's very interesting to see the trepidation first hand that they have with respect to\nthe technology, despite their debit-based society being more geared for it in any case (DG felt that\neven putting Bitcoin in the course name would scare away students). One of my friends (a hedge\nfund manager) told me that female japanese engineers are very good, and drastically under-valued. |\nmade sure to get a few invited to the class, we'll see if he's right. On the whole, it will be interesting to\nsee the caliber of engineer Japan has to offer on this front.\n\nBest,\n\nJeremy\n\n@JeremyRubin\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029087",
