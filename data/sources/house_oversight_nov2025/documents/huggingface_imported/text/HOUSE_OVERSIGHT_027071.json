Globally, 36.7 million [34.0–39.8\nmillion] people were living with HIV at the end of 2015. An estimated 0.8% [0.7-0.9%] of\nadults aged 15–49 years worldwide are living with HIV, although the burden of the epidemic\ncontinues to vary considerably between countries and regions. Sub-Saharan Africa\nremains most severely affected, with nearly 1 in every 25 adults (4.4%) living with HIV\nand accounting for nearly 70% of the people living with HIV worldwide (WHO, GHO Data).\nProblem\nMale and female condoms remain the only dual protection devices in the world that protect men\nand women from both STIs, such as HIV, as well as unplanned pregnancy. The FC2 female\ncondom remains the only dual protection device in the world that is both WHO and USFDA\napproved and is under the full control of women. Research shows that when a male\nand female condom are both available in the same market the overall number of protected sex\nacts goes up with as much as 13% (2006: Hatzell, Feldblum & Van Damme).\nHistorically, the FC2 female condom has been procured by UNFPA (United Nations Population\nFund) and USAID (United States Agency for International Development). Recently, UNFPA\nhas had a 50% decrease in available funding for all their commodity procurement, and the\nUSAID procurement budget is being slashed under the Trump administration leading to a major\ndecline of female condom procurement in Africa:\n2016 2015 2014 2013 2012\nUNFPA 10,60 11,21 17,14 34,15 24,55\nUSAID 9,96 10,02 7,32 4,5 15,63\nOn a per country example this has led to, for instance, an annual need for 3 million\nFC2 female condoms in Uganda, and no funding to procure. A need of 1 million\nfemale condoms annually in Kenya, and funding for only 230,000. A need of 6 million female\ncondoms annually in Zimbabwe and funding for only 3 million. And these are just some\nexamples of the many countries who do not receive their actual FC2 female condom need on\nthe continent of Africa.\nSolution\nFemale Health Company would like to propose a partnership with new donors\nin order to ensure that the need for the FC2 female condom is met in Africa to ensure\nprevention of HIV/AIDS among the target groups that need it. FHC is committed to\nproviding the training and technical support to the countries and target groups to ensure correct\nand safe usage of the FC2 female condom, if donors are willing to procure the female condoms\nthat are necessary in these countries. We could even create a specific donor brand for the\nFC2 female condom, to increase brand recognition for the donor in the region while\nsaving lives together.\nOn Female Health Company\nThe Female Health Company manufactures, markets and sells the FC2 Female Condom. FC2 is the only currently\navailable female-controlled product approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and cleared by\nthe World Health Organization (WHO) for purchase by U.N. agencies that provides dual protection against\nunintended pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STIs), including HIV/AIDS. The Company's first\ngeneration product was the FC1 Female Condom, a Class III medical device approved by FDA in 1993. The\nCompany's second generation product, FC2, has been available globally since 2007, and in the U.S. since 2009\nafter it was approved by the FDA as a Class III medical device. To date, FHC has shipped its female condom to\nover 140 countries worldwide.\nCurrently, there are only two FDA approved and marketed products that prevent the transmission of HIV/AIDS\nthrough sexual intercourse: the male condom and FC2. FC2 is currently the only FDA approved and marketed\nfemale-controlled product that prevents STIs, including HIV/AIDS. Used consistently and correctly, FC2 provides\nwomen dual protection against STIs, including HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancy. When used correctly the\nprotection rates against unintended pregnancies are 95 percent for female condoms compared to 98 percent for\nmale condoms according to the FDA. FC2 is not seen as directly competing with the male condom; it provides an\nalternative to either unprotected sex or male condom usage.\nAn economic analysis of the cost effectiveness of an FC2 HIV/AIDS prevention program conducted by Dr. David\nHoltgrave, the chairman of the Department of Health Behavior and Society at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg\nSchool of Public Health, was featured in the March 26, 2012 issue of AIDS and Behavior. The study showed that\nthe Washington, D.C. FC2 prevention program, a public-private partnership to provide and promote FC2,\nprevented enough HIV infections in the first year alone to save over $8 million in avoided future medical care\ncosts (over and above the cost of approximately $445,000 for the program). This means that for every dollar spent\non the program, there was a cost savings of nearly $20. In the article Dr. Holtgrave concluded, \"These results\nclearly indicate that delivery of, and education about, Female Condoms is an effective HIV prevention intervention\nand an outstanding public health investment.\" Washington, D.C. began its program in 2010 to fight a disease that\nis at epidemic levels. At least 3 percent of Washington, D.C. residents have HIV or AIDS, a prevalence rate that\nis the highest of any U.S. city.\nIn May 2014, a business case was published by Global Health Visions, LLC, commissioned by Rutgers WPF, the\nadvocacy partner of the Universal Access to Female Condoms (UAFC) Joint Programme. Part of the publication\nwas a study comparing total expected costs with total estimated economic benefits and it determined there was an\nexcellent return on investment for female condoms in sub-Saharan Africa. For example, in Nigeria an investment\nof $1 offers a $3.20 return on investment to the country's economy.\nNumerous clinical and behavioral studies have been conducted regarding use of the female condom. Studies show\nthat in many cultures, the female condom is found acceptable by women and their partners. Importantly, studies\nalso show that when the female condom is made available as an option along with male condoms there is a\nsignificant increase in protected sex acts with a concurrent decrease in STIs. The increase in protected sex acts\nvaries by country and averages between 10 percent and 35 percent.\nFC2 consists of a soft, loose fitting sheath and two rings: an external ring of rolled nitrile and a loose internal ring\nmade of flexible polyurethane. FC2's soft sheath lines the vagina, preventing skin-to-skin contact during\nintercourse. Its external ring remains outside the vagina, partially covering the external genitalia. The internal ring\nis used for insertion and helps keep the device in place during use.\nFC2's primary raw material, a nitrile polymer, offers a number of benefits over natural rubber latex, the raw\nmaterial most commonly used in male condoms. FC2's nitrile polymer is stronger than latex, reducing the\nprobability that the female condom sheath will tear during use. Unlike latex, FC2's nitrile polymer quickly transfers\nheat. FC2 can warm to body temperature immediately upon insertion, which may enhance the user's sensation and\npleasure. Unlike the male condom, FC2 may be inserted in advance of arousal, eliminating disruption during sexual\nintimacy. FC2 is also an alternative to latex sensitive users who are unable to use latex male or female condoms\nwithout irritation. To the Company's knowledge, there is no reported allergy to the nitrile polymer. FC2 is prelubricated,\ndisposable, and recommended for use during a single sex act. FC2 is not reusable.\nThe first clinical evidence of AIDS was noted more than thirty years ago. Since then, HIV/AIDS has become the\nmost devastating pandemic facing humankind in recorded history. In November 2009, WHO released statistics\nindicating that on a world-wide basis, HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of death in women 15 to 44 years of\nage. According to WHO, in 2012 worldwide women comprised 50 percent of all the adults living with HIV and\napproximately 58 percent of all new adult cases of HIV/AIDS in Sub-Saharan Africa. In the United States the\nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and FDA both list heterosexual sex as the most common\nmethod of HIV transmission in women.\nFor sexually active couples, male condoms and FC2 are the only barrier methods approved by the FDA for\npreventing sexual transmission of HIV/AIDS. In recent years, scientists have sought to develop alternative means\nof preventing HIV/AIDS. Based on the complexities of such research, a viable prevention alternative is unlikely\nto be available in the foreseeable future. To date, it is clear that condoms, male and female, continue to play a key\nrole in the prevention of STIs, including HIV/AIDS. The United Nations Joint Programme on HIV/AIDS\n(UNAIDS) has reported that, since the beginning of the HIV/AIDS epidemic, it is estimated that condoms have\naverted approximately 50 million new cases. FC2, when used consistently and correctly, gives a woman control\nover her sexual health by providing dual protection against STIs, including HIV/AIDS, and unintended pregnancy.\nThe feminization of HIV/AIDS has increased the relevance of FC2 for the prevention of unintended pregnancies\nas well as disease prevention. Unintended pregnancy may result in maternal and infant death, babies with\nHIV/AIDS, AIDS orphans, and increased health care costs.",
