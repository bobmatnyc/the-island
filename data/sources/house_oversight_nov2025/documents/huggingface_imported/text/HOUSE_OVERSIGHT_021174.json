  "text": "When the pain relief kicked in, everything and everyone dwindled\naway until I felt like Alice in Wonderland who just swallowed the\nshrinking tablet and everyone standing around me seemed to move so\nquick, speak so loud and hover above me. When I awoke from my\ninduced state, I was alone in a different room. Not knowing at all what\nwent on but feeling a little better, I called in the nurse who looked\nthrough my charts and checked my vital signs. Then told me the doctor\nwould be in shortly to inform me of the conclusion to my illness.\n\nHe was a tall man with dark hair, and a hardened look about him\nobviously from his job and constantly seeing the worst horror stories man\ncould think of, he just bluntly told me | had miscarried in early stages of\npregnancy. | should be fine to go home as soon as my course of\nintravenous antibiotics was complete. The news sunk in fast and hit a\ndeep nerve. I waited for the doctor to close the curtain before I let out any\nemotion and cried for my disastrous lifestyle that was dragging me into a\nworld that I wanted to break out of. This reoccurring cycle of believing I\nneeded men like Jeffrey to succeed in my life was draining the last bits of\nsensitivity left in my heart. I was picked up by Jeffrey himself-who took\nthe doctor alone to the side of the busy hallway to have a private\nconversation about something. Jeffrey wasn’t comforting at all, instead he\nsent me back home to rest for a couple weeks, and | only fell deeper into\na depression, using all forms of self-medication to treat my sorrows.\n\nTwo weeks later, as if Jeffrey was trying to lighten my spirits, he told\nme I would be going to his island to meet a new client. He is a Harvard\nProfessor, named Stephen Kosslyn. I would be spending two days with\nhim showing him around the island, dining with him, and treating him to\na massage whenever he wanted. Without Jeffrey even verbalizing the\nneed to have sex with him, he told me to keep him happy like I had my\nfirst client. I packed my suitcase with island apparel, and kissed T.J good-\nbye, who had at least offered me a warm embrace upon the news of my\nmiscarriage but none other than that knowing it wasn’t his.\n\nStephen was a quirky little man with white hair and a mad scientist look\nabout him. We arrived separately and I greeted him when one of the\nhousekeepers picked him up from the airport and arrived by boat, instead\nof helicopter as Jeffrey and Ghislane often arrive on. We made our\nacquaintances and he looked as if he was tripping over himself with\nwords, obviously delighted with his company and location for the\nweekend. { showed him around as Jeffrey had asked and took him on an\nadventurous quad bike ride around the small curvy paths, leading the way\nand letting loose my hair, doing something that gave me a natural high\ninstead of the prescription one. The sights alone were breathtaking from\nthe mountainous peaks of the untouched parts of the island, we sat ata\ncliff and just sat there, not saying a word to each other besides to\n\n59\n\n'] Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004 192\n\ncompliment the sights mother nature that appealed to us. I didn’t feel as if\nlL owed this stranger anything but what was expected of me by Jeffrey and\nI could be polite, I just couldn’t be myself.\n\nWe got back to the main villa to see what time dinner would be served\nso we could have time to unpack and clean up beforehand. We both met\nat six pm for dinner on the outside veranda. He sat at the head of the\ntable and I sat next to him, politely folding my napkin to put in my lap.\nThe first time Jeffrey and Ghislane had seen me cut meat and eat with a\nfork and knife they were so appalled, making fun of my unsophisticated\nhabits. Ghislane took the fork and knife in her hands and proceeded to\nshow me how to politely cut my food and eat. Now that my mannerisms\nhad improved they wouldn’t have to be worried about my etiquette when\nsomeone important was around anyone. We both drank the red wine\nsupplied on the table and it seemed to warm me up on the breezy night.\nBy the time dinner was served and another red wine bottle later, he\nseemed to get funnier. | made fun of his tousled hair and he poked at me\nfor my skinny legs, calling me a wanna-be- anorexic. When dessert was\nbrought out, he asked if he could receive one of the delightful massages\nhe has been hearing about from Jeffrey. | gulped more red wine down and\nsweetly complied with his offer, dreading the moment I'd have to see his\nnaked body, let alone touch it. I asked the housekeeper Kathy that had\nbeen serving us that night to please have someone set up a massage bed\nin one of the cabana’s. | went to my room to down a few Xanax, telling\nhim I wanted to freshen up after dinner but to meet me in his cabana in\ntwenty minutes or so. | was ready to go as | had said, twenty minutes\nlater, with the effects of the tablets mixed with the red wine, and I would\nhe free not to feel anything. He was still dressed when { got in the cabana,\nobviously not accustomed to this and a lot shyer than what I had been\nused to, I told him he’d need to undress and lie face down on the table,\nputting a towel to cover his bare bottom to prevent him feeling\nembarrassed during the massage. I gave the massage my earnest as I\nalways had, and quickly got through having intercourse with him. Not\nwanting to make any foreplay or anything extravagant out of it, I let him\nthink that’s as good as it got, and by the smile on his face, J thought I had\ndone enough.\n\nThe next day I took him down to the beach for a real massage under a\ntiki-hut on the waters edge. It was one of Jeffrey’s favorite places to have\na massage, as he droned out to the sound of the waves and my gentle\ntherapeutic strokes. Afterwards we had lunch back at the main villa and\nwent back down to the beach to swim out to the water trampoline about\none hundred meters off the dock. He didn’t do any bouncing around or\nanything like that. It was just a good base point for a rest spot after a long\n\n60\n\nU Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFRL004 193\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021174",
