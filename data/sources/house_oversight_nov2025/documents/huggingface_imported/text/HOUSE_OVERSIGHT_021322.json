  "text": "experiences in some way or other, and\nthen integrating in some way the new\nand old together. This integration\nrequires constant and dynamic changes\nto the brain structures that represent\nwhat we know and how we use it.'! One\nway this could happen is that when we\nperceive something new, we actually re-\nenact in our mind’s eye the previous\nrelated perceptions. For example, if we\nencounter an apple — having encountered\nmany previously -- perhaps we actually\nimagine (Seeing) one or more previous\napples or episodes involving apples, or\nimagine (performing) one or more\ninstances of biting an apple or throwing\none, and/or imagine tasting and smelling\none. We might also imagine hearing the\nword “apple”, producing the sounds of\nthe word, seeing the written form of the\nword, or even hearing, seeing, or\nproducing synonyms or related words in\nour first (e.g., “Granny Smith”) or\nsecond (e.g., “pomme”) languages. We\npropose that understanding an apple is\ntantamount to executing this entire set of\nprocesses, and thus, that the circuits for\nunderstanding are very complicated and\ntake up a large portion of the brain.\n\nOf course, not all of what we\nunderstand is directly available to the\nsenses; we can clearly understand beliefs\nand emotions as well as physical objects\nand overt actions. Brain researchers\ngenerally take the view that previous\nexperience guides understanding of\nabstract concepts in much the same way\nthat it guides the understanding of the\nmore concrete entities. For example, we\ncan understand the emotional states of\nother people by imagining being in those\nstates ourselves. When I see someone\nfeeling happy or sad, I can evoke\nexamples from my own previous\nexperience of feeling happy or sad\n(perhaps even for the same reasons), and\n\nPage | 76\n\nby feeling the emotion, I can understand\nit. The closer my previous experience is\nto the perceived one, the better the\n“understanding”. This principle holds\nwhether one is trying to understand\nobjects or people. An important\ndistinction between people and objects\nwhen trying to understand their actions\nis that people, but not objects, have\nintentions.\n\nThe Social Brain\n\nThe critical question for\nneurobiologists is how does the brain\nunderstand. In particular, we want to\nknow whether the same brain circuits\nthat are used when we experience things\npersonally are also used when we try to\nunderstand another person having the\nsame experiences, whether these\nexperiences are concrete, like grasping a\ncup or hitting a baseball, or more\nabstract like feeling sad or fearful or in\npain. We also want to know whether\nunderstanding the simple concrete\nperceptions and these highly complex\nemotional states are mediated similarly\nin the brain. Further, we are interested in\nthe overlap between conscious and\nunconscious understanding and shared or\npersonal understanding. One way to\naddress these questions is to examine the\nbrain structures responsible for specific\ntypes of personal sensations, actions, and\ncognitive processes, and to see if these\nsame ones play a role when individuals\nattempt to understand these functions in\nothers. Using modern techniques of\nphysiology, experiments of this type\nhave been conducted in both monkeys\nand humans, with some surprising\nresults.\n\nIt is now possible to measure\nbrain activity of humans while having a\nwide range of different kinds of\nexperiences.
