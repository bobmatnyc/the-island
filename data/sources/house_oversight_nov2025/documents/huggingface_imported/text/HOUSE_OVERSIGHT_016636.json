Residents of the Town of Palm\nBeach (Town) receive potable water from the City through a franchise agreement that expires\nin the year 2029. Due, in part, to the highly publicized \" precautionary boil water\" notice issued\nby the City in September of 2007, concerns arose regarding the overall safety of the drinking\nwater supply being provided to the Town. Accordingly, HSA Engineers and Scientists was\nasked to collect and analyze additional samples from the water supply. These additional\nsamples were collected by HSA personnel on November 14, 2008 and were submitted to a\nlaboratory independent of the ones used by the City for their routine drinking water testing\nrequirements mandated by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) and the Florida\nDepartment of Environmental Protection (FDEP). There are more than 90 testing parameters\nthat are required to be analyzed on drinking water supplies by the USEPA and the FDEP. HSA\ncollected samples and tested for all of these drinking water parameters and the detailed results\nare supplied in the enclosed tabular summary.\nAlso as shown in the attached detailed summary table, all of the testing results obtained from\nour recent sampling passed and all constituents were well below the allowable limits\nestablished by State and Federal regulations.\nWhat are Trihalomethanes (THMs) and Why Did We Receive a Notice That They Were\nElevated?\nDuring the precautionary boil water notice that occurred during the latter part of 2007, the City\nadded more chlorine to their finished drinking water to ensure adequate bacterial kill. Chlorine\nreacts with natural organics (that cause variations in the water’s color) producing a group of\ncompounds called Trihalomethanes (THMs). Up to a point, the higher the chlorine dose added,\nthe higher the THM concentrations produced. The USEPA has established a limit of 80 parts\nper billion (ppb) for drinking water supplies. In a few samples collected by the City during the\n‘boil water notice’ time period, elevated THM test results were obtained due to the additional\nchlorine in the drinking water. This represented a one-time spike in THM results and the\ncurrent level is well below the 80 parts per billion limit. During the special testing completed by\nHSA, the THM level was measured at slightly more than 50 parts per billion, well below the\nacceptable limit set by the regulators.\nPage 2 of 8\nWhat Do I Need To Do To Ensure My Drinking Water is Safe?\nAside from the recent test results collected and analyzed by HSA, we reviewed historical test\nresults, also summarized in the enclosed table. The City produces a safe drinking water of\nhigh quality based on the test results over the last several years. According to the USEPA and\nthe FDEP established standards, the City’s drinking water supply is of good quality and can be\nconsumed directly without concern. For those who want an added measure of protection,\nsubstituting bottled drinking water is an option or under the kitchen counter reverse osmosis\n(RO) filtration system can be installed as added intermediary treatment to provide an excellent\nsource of high quality of drinking water. These RO units are not cost prohibitive, can be easily\ninstalled, and can usually supply sufficient drinking water for a typical household. A separate\ntap is usually installed near the standard sink faucet so the RO water is delivered on demand.\nThere are several local reputable vendors that can provide free quotation for installing under\nthe kitchen counter RO units. Please note that the typical RO unit we are referring to does not\ntreat the entire household water supply but rather just the water intended for drinking or\ncooking purposes.\nTo add a layer of confidence to residents’ concerns about the quality of the City’s drinking\nwater, we also recommend that the Town establish a primary point of contact for the City for\ncourtesy notification and/or discussion of real time details related to issues with the City’s\ntreatment and distribution processes. This could potentially avoid dramatized response to\ntypically less-detailed public notification.\nINTRODUCTION\nResidents of Palm Beach receive potable water from the City of West Palm Beach (City)\nthrough a franchise agreement Town of Palm Beach (Town). As required under rule 62-550,\nFlorida Administrative Code, to protect the public health and ensure the quality of the delivered\npotable water product, these taps are routinely sampled by the City of West Palm Beach’s\nPublic Utilities Department for specified monitoring parameters. Concerned about assuring the\nquality of the potable water product delivered to Town residents by the City, the Town\nauthorized HSA Engineers & Scientists (HSA) to conduct a one-time sampling event from two\nof the sampling taps on the potable water distribution system (piping) serving the Town.\nCollected samples were targeted for laboratory analyses for regulated water chemistry\nparameters, constituents, and microbiologics most likely to be present in South Florida drinking\nwater supplies.\nPage 3 of 8\nCITY OF WEST PALM BEACH’S DRINKING WATER MONITORING PROGRAMS\nHSA evaluated the City’s monitoring program and most recent results. Steve Schmidt,\nlaboratory manager at the City’s water treatment plant and Chris Saliba of U.S. Water,\nCorporation, the City’s treatment system process and monitoring consultant, assisted with the\nacquisition of sampling protocols and laboratory analytical documentation related to the City’s\ndrinking water monitoring program. Discussions with both yielded important information about\nthe City’s drinking water monitoring and quality assurance programs. In addition, records of the\nCity’s Monthly Operating Records (MORs) and recent results from the City’s water monitoring\nprograms were obtained from the Palm Beach County Health Department (part of the State of\nFlorida’s Department of Health, FDOH).\nThe City conducts two programs to monitor its drinking water quality, a Compliance Monitoring\nProgram (compliance) and a Routine Monitoring Program (routine). Sampling locations for the\nCity’s two monitoring programs include the surface water impoundments, inbound raw water,\naquifer storage and recovery (ASR) wells, treatment plant points of entry, distribution system\npoints of entry, and distribution system pumps and sampling taps. While Routine program\nsampling events generally range from monthly to “as needed”, compliance program sampling\nevents generally range from daily to quarterly to annually to sampling for contaminants (like\nasbestos) every ninth year.\nTo monitor the drinking water quality delivered to the Town, the City conducts routine sampling\nat ten (10) permanent and temporary compliance distribution system sampling points (taps)\nsituated within the Town’s boundaries. These include:\n• Distribution System Tap 3230 (located at 3230 S. Ocean Dr.);\n• Distribution System Tap 2780 (located at 2780 S. Ocean Dr.);\n• Distribution System Tap PBGC (located at the Palm Beach Golf Course);\n• Distribution System Tap SOFS (located at the South Fire Station);\n• Distribution System Tap ISRD (located at Island Rd.);\n• Distribution System Tap RPBR (located at Royal Poinciana Blvd. X Bradley Pl.);\n• Distribution System Tap NOFS (located at the North Fire Station);\n• Distribution System Tap 702 (located at 702 N. County Rd.);\n• Distribution System Tap LINL (located at List Rd. X N. Lake Wy.); and\n• Distribution System Tap IDSE #6 (located at the north end of Ocean Blvd.);\nPage 4 of 8\nAn eleventh distribution system tap, 4201, is located at 4201 South Ocean Boulevard (in the\nSouth Palm Beach municipality), outside the jurisdiction of the Town. The Phipps Park\n“Booster” Pumping Station (PS) is located within the Town’s jurisdiction. The Phipps Park\n“Booster” is not a point of entry (POE) to the Town’s distribution system. The City’s map\nindicates the locations of the sampling taps, the booster pump station, and a one million gallon\n(1 MG) storage tank within the Town’s jurisdiction. Figure 1 depicts the distribution system\nsampling taps, “booster” pumping station, and storage tank located within the Town’s\nboundary.\nThe City conducts annual compliance sampling at several sampling locations, most notably\nfrom the first point of entry (POE) to the distribution system. According to the City’s Water\nTreatment Plant laboratory manager, the first POE is the tap located in the Water Treatment\nPlant’s analytical laboratory.\nPOINTS OF ENTRY FOR THE CITY’S DELIVERY OF DRINKING WATER TO THE\nTOWN\nPlans of the distribution system serving the Town, provided by the Town’s Public Works\nDepartment (PWD), identified five potable water transmission mains (large diameter pipes)\ncrossing the Intracoastal Waterway and connecting to the distribution system to deliver the\nCity’s potable water product to the Town. These five pipes include:\n• A 24-inch diameter transmission main crossing the Intracoastal Waterway (ICW) from/to\n5th Street (in the City) to the eastern flank of the Royal Poinciana Bridge (in the\nTown):\n• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from/to 45 th Street (in the City) to the\nintersection of North Lake Way and Orange Grove Road (in the Town);\n• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from the southern end of Flagler Drive\n(in the City) to the west end of “Sloan’s Curve (on State Road A1A, in the Town);\n• A 16-inch diameter water main crossing the ICW from the intersection of Southern\nBoulevard with Flagler Drive (in the City) to the eastern flank of the Southern\nBoulevard Bridge (in the Town); and\n• A 20-inch main crossing the ICW from the City to Everglades Island, near Barcelona\nAvenue (in the Town).\nPage 5 of 8\nFigure 1 also depicts the approximate ICW crossings and points of entry (POEs) of the\ntransmission mains to the Town. The scale of the map does not allow an accurate depiction of\nthe POEs associated with the mains. Maps of the Town’s distribution system provided by the\nPWD, generated at a significantly larger scale, were used to reference the locations of the\nPOEs for the transmission mains.\nSAMPLING AND ANALYSIS OF THE DRINKING WATER PRODUCT DELIVERED TO\nTHE TOWN\nAs a means to independently evaluate the quality of the drinking water being delivered to the\nTown, on November 14, 2008 HSA, accompanied by an employee of the City’s Public Utilities\nDepartment, sampled distribution system tap IDSE #6, representing the northern-most extent\nof the system, and tap 3230, representing the southern-most extent of the system,. Figure 1\ndepicts these sampling tap locations.\nSampling was performed by modification of the City’s (distribution system) General Sampling\nProcedures to reflect the intended exclusion of sampling equipment, field parameter testing,\nassociated equipment calibration requirements. Samples were collected in laboratorysupplied,\nunpreserved and pre-preserved containers. As required by select analytical\nmethodologies, at the sampling locations preservative was added to those sample containers\nimmediately prior to filling or to the water sample immediately prior to sealing the sample\ncontainer.\nCollected water samples were submitted to FDOH/NELAC-certified testing laboratories for\nanalysis for typical public potable water system routine and compliance monitoring parameters\nincluding Primary Drinking Water Standards (excluding select Disinfection Byproducts,\nHaloacetic Acids; Bromite; and Chlorite), for Secondary Drinking Water Standards, and for\nTotal Coliform as listed in the Florida Administrative Code rule 62-550. Test America\nLaboratories performed all of the analyses for chemical parameters. Jupiter Environmental\nLaboratories performed the analyses for the microbiologics.\nRESULTS FROM INDEPENDENT ANALYSIS OF THE CITY’S DRINKING WATER\nPRODUCT\nResults of laboratory analysis for target Primary and Secondary Drinking Standards yielded all\nchemical and physical parameters below method detection limits (MDLs) or less than\nrespective maximum contaminant limits (MCLs).\nResults of laboratory analysis for target microbiologicals yielded an absence of Total Coliform\nin the water samples collected from northern-most Tap A (IDSE #6) and southern-most\nPage 6 of 8\nTap B (3230). Table 1 arrays the target Primary and Secondary Drinking Standards, regulated\nMCLs, required sampling frequency, and laboratory analytical results for the November 14,\n2008-collected water samples.\nAppendix A contains the laboratory analytical reports from HSA’s November 14, 2008\nsampling event.\nCOMPARISON TO RECENT CITY MONITORING PROGRAM RESULTS\nThe City’s most recent annual compliance monitoring event for Primary and Secondary\nDrinking Water Standards was performed in June 2008. The sample of ‘finished’ water product\nwas collected at a sampling point (laboratory tap) at the water treatment plant. Analysis was\nperformed by the City’s FDOH/NELAC-certified, vendor analytical laboratory, Genapure.\nAnalysis yielded all target parameter results below method detection limits (MDLs) or less than\nrespective maximum contaminant limits (MCLs) per Chapter 62-550, F.A.C.\nThe City’s most recent quarterly routine monitoring event for Nitrate and Nitrite was performed\nin August 2008. The sample of ‘finished’ water product was also collected at the water\ntreatment plant’s laboratory tap. Analysis was again performed by the City’s vendor analytical\nlaboratory, Genapure. The detected concentration of Nitrate was less than the MCL (10 mg/L).\nThe concentration of Nitrite was below the MDL (< 0.053 mg/L). Nitrate concentrations from\nHSA’s November 2008 sampling event are lower than either result reported from the City’s\nannual or latest quarterly sampling from the water treatment plant’s laboratory tap. The\ndifference between these results is not relevant since the reported concentrations from the City\nand from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL.\nTable 1 includes a comparative array of the City’s monitoring program results to the results\nfrom HSA’s November 2008 distribution system tap sampling for the target Primary and\nSecondary Drinking Standards.\nAPPLICATION OF DISINFECTION CHEMICALS, BYPRODUCTS, AND THE EFFECT ON\nTASTE\nTo eliminate the presence of microbiologics, such as Coliform bacteria, the City applies\nchlorine at the treatment plant to disinfect the processed supply water. This treatment process\nresults in the formation of chemical compounds in the potable water product known as\nDisinfection Byproducts (DBPRs). The allowable concentrations of DBPRs in drinking water\nare set as Standards in FDEP rule 62-550, F.A.C.\nThe latest quarterly (3-month) reporting period for the City’s weekly routine monitoring of\nDBPRs (Total Trihalomethanes, TTHMs) ended September 2008. The samples of water\nPage 7 of 8\nproduct are regularly collected at a series of distribution system sampling taps. Analysis was\nperformed by the City’s analysts at the Water Treatment Plant’s laboratory. Results from\nHSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from northern-most Tap A (IDSE #6) are directly\ncompared to the City’s routine sampling of drinking water from distribution system tap LINL\n(closest to Tap A). Results from HSA’s sampling of the Town’s drinking water from southernmost\nTap B (3230) are compared directly to those from the City’s sampling of that tap. TTHM\nconcentrations from HSA’s November 2008 sampling event are slightly higher than the\naverages of the results reported from the City’s latest quarterly sampling from tap LINL and tap\n3230, respectively. The difference between these results is not relevant since the reported\nconcentrations from the City and from HSA’s sampling event are still less than the MCL. It is\nnoted that the concentration of TTHMs reported from the City’s annual compliance event\n(collected at the Treatment Plant) is close to the MCL. This is not unexpected as the sampling\nlocation (treatment plant laboratory tap) is much closer to the point of disinfection than the\ndistribution system sampling taps. Table 1 includes a comparative array of the detected\nTTHM’s from City’s monitoring program to those detected from HSA’s November 2008\nsampling event as well as the TTHM Standards per rule 62-550, F.A.C.\nThe City Public Utilities Department acknowledges that to keep the potable water product free\nof microbiologics occasionally requires increasing the concentration of disinfecting chlorine\nadded to the supply water. This results in brief incidences of potable water product with a\nnotable change in the taste and higher concentrations of DBPRs. Concentrations of DBPRs\nand the stronger taste of chlorine subside with the inevitable reduction of chlorination.\nCONCLUSION\nAs a measure of the quality of the drinking water product being delivered to the Town by the\nCity, results from HSA’s November 2008 collection of potable water from the northern-most\nand southern-most distribution system sampling taps revealed target regulated drinking water\nparameters at concentrations below the MCL standards established in FDEP rule 62-770,\nF.A.C.\nA comparative of the results obtained from HSA’s sampling event to the City’s reported annual\nand quarterly results from 2008 monitoring events found minor variations in reported\nconcentrations for select parameters (see Table 1). These variations pose no concern for the\nquality of the potable water product being delivered to the Town since all parameter\nconcentrations reported from the City’s monitoring events and by HSA’s sampling event are\nless than respective MCLs.\nPage 8 of 8\nComparison of a three-year average of the concentrations of Primary and Secondary Drinking\nWater Standards from the City’s annual compliance monitoring events (circa 2006, 2007, and\n2008) to the results from HSA’s November 2008 distribution system tap sampling reveals\nrelative equivalence with irrelevant differences between select parameters concentrations since\nthe averaged City results are less than respective MCLs (see Table 1).\nWith the exception of the occasional spike in concentrations of DBPRs (and corresponding\nstronger taste of chlorine in the delivered drinking water) resulting from the City’s need to\nincrease the application of sanitizing chemicals (i.e. chlorine) to treat supply water, HSA\nconcludes that the quality of the potable water product delivered to the Town by the City meets\nor beats the criteria for the standards established under rule 62-550, F.A.C.\nPrepared by:\nHSA Engineers & Scientists\nA member of the CRA family of companies\nMichael R.
