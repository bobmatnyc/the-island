  "text": "That these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump’s victory, or that Mr. Comey’s ham-fisted\ninterventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton’s electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal\n\nsignificance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials.\n\nThe totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since\nan attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election “shocks the conscience,” any\nprosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed. The public\nwill learn more once the inspector general finishes his investigation into Crossfire’s genesis. But given\nwhat is now known, due process demands, at a minimum, that the special counsel’s activity be paused.\nThose affected by Mr. Mueller’s investigation could litigate such an argument in court. One would\nhope, however, that given the facts either Mr. Mueller himself or Deputy Attorney General Rod\n\nRosenstein would do it first.\n\nMr. Rivkin and Ms. Foley practice appellate and constitutional law in Washington. He served at the\nJustice Department and the White House Counsel’s Office during the Reagan and George H.W. Bush\n\nadministrations. She is a professor at Florida International University College of Law.\n\nAppeared in the June 23, 2018, print edition.\n\nBest,\nAndrew\n\nAndrew Grossman\n\nPartner\n\nBakerHostetler\n\nWashington Square\n1050 Connecticut Ave, N.W. | Suite 1100\n\n—_ DC 20036-5304\n\nbakerlaw.com\n\n= Bray)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026489",
