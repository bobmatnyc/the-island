He increased troop levels, devoted\nbillions of dollars to equipment modernization,\nand instituted a series of reforms designed to\nenable the military to engage in several limited\nconflicts simultaneously. To compensate for the\nmaterial advantages of the United States and\nNATO, the Russian military developed a strategic\napproach known as hybrid warfare, which seeks\nto combine conventional tactics, espionage and\nsubversion, cyberattacks, and propaganda so as\nto limit the role of traditional battlefield opera-\ntions and, where possible, sow confusion as to\nwho is responsible for the aggression and how\nit should be dealt with. The strategy has been\nput into action in Ukraine, and intrusive Russian\npatrols have also harassed foreign navies and\nair forces across Northern Europe. In Georgia,\nRussian troops have constantly encroached on\nthe Tbilisi government by simply moving border\nfences encircling the Russian-backed separatist\nregion of South Ossetia.\n\nChina has also engaged in a massive military\nbuildup, and is pressing its maritime territorial\nclaims with huge fleets of coast guard vessels\nand new island bases that bristle with arma-\nments. Its tactics at sea are openly aggressive,\nbut stop just short of the sort of action that\nmight trigger live fire.\n\nlran has long cultivated indirect methods of for-\neign aggression, particularly through the covert\nequipping and training of allied Shiite militias\n\nin Arab states. In recent years, however, it has\nopenly deployed these militias in large num-\nbers—overseen on the front lines by high-ranking\nlranian officers—to battle zones in Syria and Iraq,\nand it has increasingly drawn on Afghan recruits\nin addition to Arabs. lran’s regional rivals, chiefly\nSaudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, have\nresponded with more direct foreign interventions\nof their own, most notably in Yemen.\n\nThe recent embrace of more overtly repressive policies\nstems in part from the common structural flaws of the\nmodern authoritarian model. The question of succes-\n\nsion in authoritarian governments is a constant source\n\nof tension, producing crises—such as Putin's return to\nthe presidency after his circumvention of term limits in\n2012—that require new crackdowns on dissent.\n\nMoreover, because these regimes do not allow\npeaceful rotations of power through elections, they\nrely in large part on the promise of economic growth\nas a source of legitimacy. However, they also feature\nsystemic corruption as a means of maintaining inter-\nnal cohesion. All of this leaves them ill-equipped to\ncope with economic shocks and related public anger.\nThe global economic downturn of 2008 and the more\nrecent crop in energy prices have shaken economies\nand political establishments around the world, but\nwhile citizens of democracies can take their frus-\n\ntrations to the ballot box, authoritarian rulers must\ntreat protests against austerity or unemployment as\nexistential threats.\n\nThe promise of national greatness and the menace\nof external enemies are tried-and-true alternatives\nto economic prosperity as sources of regime legiti-\nmacy. Unfortunately, promoting these narratives also\ngenerates new cycles of dissent and repression, and\ndamages ties with the outside world, further under-\nmining the economy.\n\nAtransition from bad to worse\n\nWhile the return to the blunt instruments of the past\nsuggests a fundamental weakness in the modern\nauthoritarianism model, it would be a mistake to con-\nclude that these regimes are doomed to extinction.\nThe emergence of this model was in fact a remarkable\ndemonstration of adaptability on the part of author-\nitarian rulers, who faced a uniquely inhospitable en-\nvironment in the years after the end of the Cold War.\nDemocracy, human rights, and the rule of law were\nnewly ascendant as the governing principles of the\ninternational order, and undemocratic leaders made\nthe changes necessary to survive without surrender-\ning their political dominance.\n\nf they are now reversing some of these changes, it\n\nis not just because the basic structures and incen-\ntives of authoritarian rule tend to encourage greater\nrepression over time. It is also because the external\npressure to conform to democratic standards is rapid-\nly disappearing.\n\nLeading democracies have absorbed the economic\nblows of recent years without revolution or repres-\nsion, but voter frustration has increasingly lifted up\nantiestablishment, populist, and nationalist politicians\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\n55\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019289",
