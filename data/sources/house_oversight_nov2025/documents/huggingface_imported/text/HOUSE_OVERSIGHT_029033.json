  "text": "that’s one of the fuels of this populist revolt that we’re seeing as the tea party. So I think\nthere are many, many measures, particularly about getting the banks on better footing,\nmaking them address all the liquid assets they have. I think you need a real clean-up of the\nbanks balance sheets.\n\nIn addition, I think you really need to go back and make banks do what they do:\nCommercial banks lend money, and investment banks invest in entrepreneurs and to get\naway from this trading — you know, the hedge fund securitization, which they’ve all\nbecome basically trading operations and securitizations and not put capital back and really\ngrow businesses and to grow the economy. So I think it’s a whole area that just — and I\nwill tell you, the underpinning of this populist revolt is the financial crisis of 2008. That\nrevolt, the way that it was dealt with, the way that the people who ran the banks and ran\nthe hedge funds have never really been held accountable for what they did, has fueled\nmuch of the anger in the tea party movement in the United States.\n\nQuestioner: Thank you.\n\nBannon: Great question.\n\nQuestioner: Hello, Mr. Bannon. I’m Mario Fantini, a Vermonter living in Vienna,\nAustria. You began describing some of the trends you're seeing worldwide, very dangerous\ntrends, worry trends. Another movement that I’ve been seeing grow and spread in Europe,\nunfortunately, is what can only be described as tribalist or neo-nativist movement — they\ncall themselves Identitarians. These are mostly young, working-class, populist groups, and\nthey’re teaching self-defense classes, but also they are arguing against — and quite\neffectively, I might add — against capitalism and global financial institutions, ete. How do\nwe counteract this stuff? Because they’re appealing to a lot of young people at a very\nvisceral level, especially with the ethnic and racial stuff.\n\nBannon: I didn’t hear the whole question, about the tribalist?\n\n“One of the committees in Congress said to the Justice Department, 35 [bank] executives,\nI believe, that they should have criminal indictments against — not one of those has ever\nbeen followed up on.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029033",
