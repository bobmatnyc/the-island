  "text": "Base metals\n\nPreference: neutral\n\nCurrent (24 Oct) (last month): Copper USD 7,815/mt (8,271); Nickel USD 16,336/mt (18,351);\nAluminum USD 1,912/mt (2,079)\n\nUBS View 6-month target: Copper: USD 8,800/mt; Nickel: USD 19,000/mt; Aluminum: USD 2,100/mt\ne After the swift uptick in prices, base metals have been under renewed pressure. The initial price strength\n—a simple catch up with Chinese prices triggered by a shift in demand expectations — is losing strength.\n¢ In order to continue the price rally, a firm increase in final metal demand is needed. Since global\neconomic growth is far from seeing such a demand uptick in industrial activity during 4Q12, we think that\nprices are likely to trade only sideways in the coming months before trending higher in 1Q13.\ne Loose monetary policy is a good precondition for activity to pick up, but not a guarantee after so many\nrounds of monetary stimulus. We therefore look east to China. Although industrial activity growth in China\nis likely to bottom out, the upcoming leadership change in the country (November 2012 to March 2013),\nwill likely delay a bigger investment program into 1Q13. The latest stimulus program will probably prevent\nChinese IP from decelerating even further, but will not lift it meaningfully higher.\n¢ Ona single commodity level, we favor copper and nickel. For nickel, short-term supply issues due to a\nslower ramp up of new and existing projects have temporarily brought the market closer to balance than\ninitially expected. Furthermore, we should see higher Chinese stainless steel demand with stabilizing\nhousing activity and a demand pick up in stainless steel related products.\n¢ With regards to copper, we expect import activity to remain strong, as seen in the import figures for\nSeptember. Overall, the copper market should remain undersupplied, which could widen if financial\ndemand is finding some store of value in the metal. We think this puts structurally low LME inventories at\nrisk and should push the metal price towards USD 8,800/mt or higher over six months.\n\n4 Positive scenario\n\n¢ China eases monetary policy aggressively, pushing credit growth to 20% y/y. In the US the Fed is able to\nlift GDP growth via QE3 and the ECB puts an effective backstop to declining industrial activity.\n\nSt Negative scenario\n\n¢ To passive Chinese authorities keep GDP growth on a constant deceleration path. A severe escalation of\nthe Eurozone crisis (room for a break-up) triggers a setback in investment activity - including in Germany.\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nChina's growth deceleration should come to an end. But hard economic activity\n\nGenmand indicators, especially for China, have yet to catch up with the increase in prices.\nHence, the current base metal market is already reflecting considerable growth\ngoodwill that is in need of a demand confirmation by China, the US or Europe.\nCopper output continues to undershoot market expectations and should be\n\nSupply watched closely, as investment activity in mines increased sharply. For zinc,\nprospects for mine closures have been delayed and should keep the market\noversupplied.\n\nEconomic data/forward Chinese economic data — trade data, CPI, IP and loan growth by financial\n\ncurve institutions. Key date: 10-15 Oct\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne We reiterate that the strong uptick in\nbase metal prices is skating on thin ice, in\nour view. Real activity has yet to follow\nand support prices over a longer time\nperiod. 50% of the upside potential on a\n6-month horizon is likely to be behind us,\nmaking only copper and nickel attractive,\nwith +10% expected return.\n\nStrategic (2 years)\n\ne Although the strongest performance\nshould be visible in zinc and lead, with\nexisting mine capacity expected to peak\nin 2014/15, the recent price strength\nmakes such an investment unattractive\nnow, based on timing. Given a\nstructurally solid supply side, investors\nshould avoid aluminum and nickel. A\nfirmer supply side should also limit the\nupside in copper.\n\nNet speculative copper position at\nComex are far from being overstretched\n80\n60\n40\n20\n0\n(20)\n(40)\n(60)\n(80)\nJan-93 Jan-96 Jan-99 Jan-02 Jan-05 Jan-08 Jan-11\nmm Long positions Short positions — Net long position\n\nIn thousand contracts\n\nSource: Bloomberg, UBS, as of Oct. 2012\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO's asset class specialists Dominic Schnider, dominic.schnider@ubs.com or Giovanni Staunovo, giovanni.staunovo@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025284",
