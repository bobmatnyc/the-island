  "text": "CHAPTER 11\nEnter Assange\n\nThanks to Russia (and thanks to WikiLeaks), Snowden remains\nfree.\n\n—JULIAN ASSANGE, Newsweek, 2015\n\nULIAN ASSANGE had made a brilliant career of trafficking in\n\nstate, military, and corporate secrets. Born on July 3, 1971, in\nQueensland, Australia, Assange began his hacking career while still\na teenager. Using the alias Mendax (“the untruthful one”), he had\nhacked into the computers of the Pentagon, the U.S. Navy, NASA,\nCitibank, Lockheed Martin, and Australia’s Overseas Telecommuni-\ncations Commission before he was twenty. At the age of twenty-five,\nhe pleaded guilty to twenty-five charges of hacking in Australia but\nwas released on a good behavior bond. In 2006, with the spread of\nTor software, he co-founded WikiLeaks, a website in which secret\ndocuments could be anonymously sent and posted. The site received\nlittle public attention until Bradley Manning sent it several hun-\ndred thousand lowly classified U.S. military and State Department\ndocuments in April 2010. With these stolen documents, WikiLeaks\nbecame a media sensation, and Assange, the runner-up for Time’s\nMan of the Year for 2010, became a leading figure, along with Appel-\nbaum, in the global hacktivist underground.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 99 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019587",
