Judge: Prosecutors broke law in Epstein sex case

By JULIE K. BROWN
Miarni Herald

MIAMI — A judge ruled Thursday
that federal prosecutors among
them, U.S, Labor Secretary Alexan-
der Acosta — broke federal law when
they signed a plea agreement with a
wealthy, politically connected sex traf-
ficker and concealed it from more than
40) of his underage victims,

U.S. District Judge Kenneth A.
Marr, ina 33-page opinion, said the
evidence he reviewed showed that Jef-
frey Epstein had been operating an in-
ternational sex operation in which he
and others recruited underage girls
not only in Florida — but from over-
seas, in Violation of federal law.

“Epstein used paicl employees to
find and bring minor girls to him,”
wrote Marra, who is based in Palm
Beach County. “Epstein worked in
concert with others to obtain minors
not only for his own sexual gratifica-
tion, but also for the sexual gratifica-
tion of others.”

Instead’ of prosecuting Epstein
under federal sex trafficking laws,
Acosta, then the U.S. attorney in Mi-
ami, helped negotiate a nonprosecu-
tion agreement that gave Epstein and
his co-conspirators immunity from
federal prosecution, Epstein, who

lived in a Palm Beach mansion, was
allowed to quietly plead guilty in state
court to two prostitution changes and
served just 13 months in the county
jail. His accomplices, some of whom
have never been identified, were never
charged.

Acosta agreed to seal the deal, which
meant that none of Epstein’s victims,
who were mostly 13 to 16 years old at
the time of the abuse, were told about
it until it was too late for them to ap-

pear at his sentencing and possibly
reject the deal, Upon leaming that Ep
stein had pleaded guilty without their
knowledge, two of his victims filed a
lawsuit in the Southern District of F lor-
ida in 2008, claiming that prosecutors
violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act,
which grants victims of federal crimes
a series of rights, including the ability
to confer with prosecutors about a pos-
sible plea deal.

Marra agreec, saying that while
prosecutors had the right to resolve the
case in any way they saw fit, they vio
lated the law by hiding the agreement
from Epstein’s victims, Marra’s deci-
sion capped Il years of litigation

which included the release of a trove of

emails showing how Acosta and other
prosecutors worked with Epstein’s high
profile lawyers to conceal the deal
and the scope of Epstein’s crimes
from both his victims and the public,

‘Particularly problematic was the
Government's decision to conceal the
existence of the (agreement) and mis-
lead the victims to believe that feder-
al prosecution was still a possibility,”
Marra wrote.

The U.S. attorney's office in Miami
declined to comment,

In addition to Palm Beach, Fla.,
Epstein also has a home in New York
and, lives on Little St. James Island

off St. Thomas,

Brad Edwards, the Port Lauderdale
attorney who brought the case, said
he was elated at the judge's ruling,
but admitted he is bitter that the case
took 11 years to litigate, blaming fed-
eral prosecutors for needlessly drag-
ging out the case when they could
have remedied their error when it was
brought to their attention in 2008,

While the victims ultimately would
like to see Epstein go to jail, the
judge's ruling stopped short of issu-
ing aremedy or punishment, He gave
the government and victims 15 days
to confer with each other to come up
with a resolution. [ts unclear what
that resolution would be,

Edwards conceded that Epstein’s
sentence isn’t likely to be overturned.
He was released in 2009,

But victims’ rights advocates say
that other charges can still be brought
against Epstein if more victims come
forward in other jurisdictions. There
has been no statute of limitations for
sex trafficking since 2002.

The decision follows a three-part
series published by the Miami Herald
in November, “Perversion of Justice,”
which detailed how federal prosecu-
tors worked in concert with Epstein’s
lawyers to arrange the deal.

Since then, the U.S, Department
of Justice has launched a probe into
whether federal prosecutors commit-
ted any wrongdoing,
