Dear Mr. Jeffrey Epstein

Jared Kushner, New York's youngest powerhouse publisher, is celebrating the 25th Anniversary of the New
York Observer on Thursday, March 14th.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg will be by his side to toast you all.

The Observer is honoring those who have defined and shaped New York since 1987. They are celebrating the
cities best, brightest and most influential in culture,media and finance. The salmon pink pages are revered
among New York's elite as the preeminent voice on power.

The celebration is going to be one of those quintessential New York nights. We are looking forward to seeing
you.

XOXO,

Peggy
