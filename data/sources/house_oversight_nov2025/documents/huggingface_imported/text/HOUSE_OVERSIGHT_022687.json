And the National Enquirer did not appear to rely\non the court record for its conclusions, instead to the interpretation of an unnamed source who noted that “Bill’s name is all over the\n\nlegal papers, which are chock-full of sordid claims.”\n\nClinton’s discretion on matters of sexual restraint has attained permanent notoriety, so maybe it’s natural to assume that particular\n\nleopard doesn’t change his spots. But at this point, there is simply nothing to back those sordid claims up.\nHere’s what we do know:\n\nJeffrey Epstein is a secretive billionaire financier and Democratic donor who says he never attended college but whose “background\nis in physics.” He owns properties in New York, Florida, New Mexico, London, and Paris and also owns an island in the U.S. Virgin\n\nIslands. He has at least two private jets, including the 727.\n\nHe has known Bill Clinton since about 1995, and his relationship with him grew stronger after he left office. There is no question they\nwere friendly. Epstein’s so-called “black book,” which is less like something out of the Heidi Fleiss affair and more what most people\n\nwould call a “phone directory,” contains 21 numbers for getting in touch with Clinton, as well as emails and addresses.\n\nBut that 92-page directory also contains exactly the range of eye-poppingly famous and powerful contacts one might expect of an\n\nincredibly rich, connected person who owns Manhattan’s largest private residence, from Tony Blair to Elie Wiesel to Courtney Love.\n\nEpstein was long rumored to be a sexual libertine; “It is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do,” real estate\n\npersonality Donald Trump once said of his old friend. “And many of them are on the younger side.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022687",
