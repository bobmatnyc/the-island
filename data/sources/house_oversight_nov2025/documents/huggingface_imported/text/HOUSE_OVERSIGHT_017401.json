Over a period of years, the Supreme Court placed\nits moral imprimatur on desegregation and eventually unblocked these channels of democracy. It\nworked — not perfectly, but perfection is rarely possible in a heterogeneous and divided\ndemocracy. A similar process is today underway with regard to equality for gays.\n\nAbortion is different. The Supreme Court’s decision, now more half a century old, changed few\nminds on this issue, because those who believe that abortion — or certain kinds of abortion — is\ntantamount to murder are not like those who believed that segregation was right. The former\nbelieve that they occupy the moral high ground. And they do, if their underlying premise — that a\nfetus is a human being — is correct. No rational argument, whether made by philosophers or\nSupreme Court justices, will ever disprove the truth of that a priori premise. Nor will experience\nalter it, unlike views concerning segregation or gay rights which have been markedly changed by\nexperience.\n\nMoreover, the nation was — and remains — closely divided about the morality of abortion, both in\nthe abstract and under various circumstances. Advocates of a woman’s right to choose abortion\ncould have organized politically to win that right (at least for most women under most\ncircumstances) in the elected branches of government. According to the ACLU:\n\nBetween 1967 and 1971, under mounting pressure from the women’s rights\nmovement, 17 states decriminalized abortion. Public opinion also shifted during\nthis period. In 1968, only 15 percent of Americans favored legal abortions; by\n1972, 64 percent did. When the Court announced its landmark 1973 ruling\nlegalizing abortion in Roe v. Wade, it was marching in step with public opinion.\n\nBut it is not the proper role of the Supreme Court to march “in step” with public opinion. That is\nthe role of the elected branches of government. Instead of devoting all their resources to\ncontinuing the legislative and public opinion battle, the pro-choice movement devoted much of its\nresources to the litigation option, whose goal it was to get the Supreme Court to constitutionalize\na woman’s right to choose abortion. It worked as planned, thus sparing the pro-choice movement\nthe difficult political task of organizing and fundraising on a state-by-state basis. The justices did\nthe work for them, by simply striking down most abortion laws in one fell swoop.\n\nThe short-term consequences of constitutionalizing the abortion issue were powerful and positive\nfor the choice movement. The long-term consequences were disastrous. Roe v. Wade provided\nthe Religious Right and the conservative wing of the Republican Party one of the best organizing\ntools and rallying cries imaginable. The right-to-life movement was energized by this decision and\nbecame one of the most potent political forces both nationally and in a large number of states. At\nthe same time, the pro-choice movement became lethargic, celebrating its great judicial victory\nand neglecting the hard work of organizing and fundraising — at least in the beginning. As the\nACLU has put it:\n\n... the backlash was swift and fierce. Anti-choice forces quickly mobilized,\ndedicating themselves to reversing Roe. In 1974, the ACLU established its\n\n314\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017401",
