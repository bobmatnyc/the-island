  "text": "The Missing Episode of Seinfeld\n\n[erry Seinfeld is onstage at a comedy club]\n\nJerry: Did God look down at Adam and Eve one day and say, “Oops,\n| forgot something. Let there be erections.” So Adam got the first hard-\non in history. But God forgot to say when. And that’ s why men don’ t\nalways get an erection when they want one. Women don’ t know it, but\nsometimes men have to actually pray for a hard-on. “Please, God, |’ Il be\nsensitive to her needs, | promise, oh God, please, just make it hard...”\n\n[Cut to George Costanza, having dinner with his parents. There is no\nconversation, but George’ s father is smiling, then chortles out loud.]\n\nGeorge: What! What! What’ s so funny? Is it because lI’ m\nbecoming more like you every day?\n\nGeorge’ s father: Should | tell’ im? I’ m gonna tell’ im.\n\nGeorge’ s mother: No, don’ t tell’ im. It’ s private between you\nand me. It’ s none of his beeswax.\n\nGeorge: C' mon, stop teasing me, | wanna know, whatever it is, |\nwanna know, so c’ mon, tell me.\n\nGeorge’ s father: Okay, |’ m gonna tell ' im. |’ ve been taking\nViagra, George, and it really works. Your mother and | have been making\n\nwhoopee like it was going out of style.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015398",
