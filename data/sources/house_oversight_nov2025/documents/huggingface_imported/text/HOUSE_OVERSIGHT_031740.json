Flynn may have leaked information that shows Pence and the Trump transition team knew\nthat foreign governments were paying him.\n\nIf this information turns out to be true, 1t would be a devastating blow to the Vice President’s reputation. So far, Pence is\nuntouched by the Russia scandal.\n\nThe prevailing opinion is that Pence didn’t know anything about Flynn’s calls to the Russian ambassador to the U.S. And\nthe administration’s story is that Flynn lied about his Russian contacts to Pence.\n\nRelated\n\n&\nALERT: House Democrats Made The PERFECT Trap For Pence, and He Fell Right Into It.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031740",
