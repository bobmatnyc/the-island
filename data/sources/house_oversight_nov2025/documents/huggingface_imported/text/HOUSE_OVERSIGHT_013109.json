People learn things gradually, and\nshow a continuous development in ability, not a quick jump from ignorance to mastery. We\nbelieve that this gradual development of ability is the signature of genuine learning, and that\nprescriptively an AGI system must be designed in order to have continuous and asymmetrical\ndevelopment across a variety of tasks in order to be considered a genuine learning system. While\nquantum leaps in ability may be possible in an AGI system which can just “graft” new parts\nof brain onto itself (or an augmented human which may someday be able to do the same using\nimplants), such acquisition of knowledge is not really learning. Grafting on knowledge does not\nbuild the cognitive pathways needed in order to actually learn. If this is the only mechanism\navailable to an AGI system to acquire new knowledge, then it is not really a learning system.\n\n11.4 Piaget’s Stages in the Context of Uncertain Inference\n\nPiaget’s developmental stages are very general, referring to overall types of learning, not specific\nmechanisms or methods. This focus was natural since the context of his work was human de-\nvelopmental psychology, and neuroscience has not yet progressed to the point of understanding\nthe neural mechanisms underlying any sort of inference (and certainly was nowhere near to\ndoing so in Piaget’s time!). But if one is studying developmental psychology in an AGI context\nwhere one knows something about the internal mechanisms of the AGI system under consid-\neration, then one can work with a more specific model of learning. Our focus here is on AGI\nsystems whose operations contain uncertain inference as a central component. Obviously the\nmain focus is CogPrime, but the essential ideas apply to any other uncertain inference centric\nAGI architecture as well.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013109",
