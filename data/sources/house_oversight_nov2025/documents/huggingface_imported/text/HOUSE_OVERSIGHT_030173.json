Such a dynamic\nwould inadvertently put pressure on post-revolutionary Egypt to be\nmore assertive in its ties with Israel and the West.\n\nThe Gushing Wound of Palestine\n\nThe Palestinian question has been at the heart of the Arab political\ndiscourse for the last seven decades. The 1979 peace deal between\nEgypt and Israel ushered in an unprecedented phase of strong\nbilateral cooperation between the two former enemies, but it was also\na major cause of the unpopularity of both Sadat and Mubarak. Israel\nbenefited from the cold peace by neutralizing the most powerful\nconventional force in the Arab world. It even coordinated closely\nwith Egypt on the siege of Gaza.Although the peace accords allowed\nEgypt to avoid another conflict with Israel and win substantial\neconomic-military aid from the United States, the country’s image\nhas suffered a significant blow in the last three decades. Strategically,\nEgypt’s withdrawal from the Arab-Israeli conflict allowed other\npowers to raise their political profile and regional influence. The\nresulting strategic vacuum simply shifted the regional balance of\npower in favor of non-Arab and/or non-traditional powers. Iran,\nSyria, and Qatar — and later Turkey — have been the biggest\nbeneficiaries of Egypt’s neutrality on the Palestinian issue.\n\nAware of the popular sentiment in favor of the Palestinian cause, the\nnew Egyptian leadership initiated two important policy shifts. First, it\nre-opened the Rafah border, which has allowed most residents of\nGaza to escape the suffocating siege imposed by Israel. Second,\nEgypt has played an active role in facilitating the unity deal between\nrival factions in Palestine. The deal represents the best chance for\nPalestinians to finally form a united front in future negotiations with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030173",
