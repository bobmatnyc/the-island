  "text": "10 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\nagency documents that “would not be available by law to a\nparty ... in litigation with the agency” incorporates the\ngeneral law governing attorney work-product privilege as\nit exists when the statute is applied. PTC v. Grolier Inc.,\n462 U.S. 19, 20, 26-27 (19838) (emphasis added); id., at 34,\nn.6 (Brennan, J., concurring in part and concurring in\njudgment). Likewise, a general reference to federal dis-\ncovery rules incorporates those rules “as they are found on\nany given day, today included,” El Encanto, Inc. v. Hatch\nChile Co., 825 F. 3d 1161, 1164 (CA10 2016), and a gen-\neral reference to “the crime of piracy as defined by the law\nof nations” incorporates a definition of piracy “that changes\nwith advancements in the law of nations,” United States\nv. Dire, 680 F. 3d 446, 451, 467-469 (CA4 2012).\n\nThe same logic applies here. The IOIA’s reference to the\nimmunity enjoyed by foreign governments is a general\nrather than specific reference.

The IOIA should therefore be understood\nto link the law of international organization immunity to\nthe law of foreign sovereign immunity, so that the one\ndevelops in tandem with the other.\n\nThe IFC contends that the IOIA’s reference to the im-\nmunity enjoyed by foreign governments is not a general\nreference to an external body of law, but is instead a spe-\ncific reference to a common law concept that had a fixed\nmeaning when the IOJA was enacted in 1945. And be-\ncause we ordinarily presume that “Congress intends to\nincorporate the well-settled meaning of the common-law\nterms it uses,” Neder v. United States, 527 U.S. 1, 23\n(1999), the IFC argues that we should read the IOIA to\nincorporate what the IFC maintains was the then-settled\nmeaning of the “immunity enjoyed by foreign govern-\nments”: virtually absolute immunity.\n\nBut in 1945, the “immunity enjoyed by foreign govern-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028552",
