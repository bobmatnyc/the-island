  "text": "Ti v4 Expert Analysis\n\nCOMMENT. The Supreme Court deci-\nsion will presumably trigger tie-breaker\nrules and divorce settlement agreements\npreviously available only to opposite-sex\nmarried couples.\n\nEducation Benefits. Access to a number of\neducation tax credits by same-sex couples\nhas been limited, both because of a student’s\nstatus as a member or non-member of the\ntaxpayer's family and because lower phase-\nout levels that apply to unmarried filers.\n\na AOTC and Lifetime Learning Credit:\nA taxpayer can claim the American Op-\nportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) or the\nLifetime Learning Credit for qualified\nexpenses paid by the taxpayer for the\neducation of the taxpayer, the taxpayer's\nspouse, or the taxpayer’s claimed depen-\ndent for the tax year for which the credit\nis claimed. Because of DOMA, a taxpay-\ner could not claim the AOTC or Lifetime\nLearning Credit for qualified expenses\npaid by his or her same-sex spouse.\n\nu Coverdell Education Savings Ac-\n\nA Coverdell Education Sav-\n\nings Account (ESA) is a savings vehicle\n\ncounts.\n\nsimilar to an individual retirement\naccount (IRA). If a Coverdell ESA\nis transferred to a surviving spouse as\nthe result of the beneficiary’ death,\nthe Coverdell ESA retains its status\nand the spouse may treat the account\nas his or her own and need not with-\ndraw the assets as a result of the trans-\nfer. Because of DOMA, this treatment\nhad been unavailable to the surviving\nspouse of a same-sex married couple.\n\na IRA Withdrawals For Education.\nTaxpayers who own IRAs (tradi-\ntional, Roth, SEP IRAs and SIMPLE\nIRAs) can make penalty-free with-\ndrawals to pay higher education ex-\npenses to the extent the distribution\ndoes not exceed the qualified higher\neducation expenses of the taxpayer,\nthe taxpayer's spouse, or the child or\ngrandchild of the taxpayer or the tax-\npayer's spouse. Once again, because\nof DOMA, this treatment had been\nunavailable to the surviving spouse of\na same-sex married couple.\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nPost-Death IRA Payments. When a surviv-\ning spouse is the beneficiary of an individual\nretirement account (IRA) he or she has cer-\ntain options not granted to other beneficia-\nries, including the ability to rollover the de-\ncedent’s IRA, tax free, to another retirement\nplan. And, if the surviving spouse is the sole\nbeneficiary, he or she can elect to treat the\nIRA as if it were his or her own. These op-\ntions may allow the survivor to delay the\nstart of required minimum distributions\n(RMDs) from the account and to stretch\nout the payment of RMDs over a longer pe-\ntiod of time. DOMA had foreclosed these\nmore favorable spousal benefits for same-sex\nmarried spouses. The Supreme Court’s deci-\nsion in Windsor presumably opens up these\ndistribution benefits to same-sex spouses.\n\n“In the case of family\nattribution rules, it is\nunclear whether application\n\nof marital status for same-\nsex spouses relates back\nto transactions already\ncompleted.”\n\nFamily Stock Attribution Rules. Code Sec.\n267 contains attribution rules designed to\nprevent related taxpayers (including “spous-\nes’ under Sec. 267(c)(4)) from recognizing\nlosses and other tax benefits otherwise al-\nlowed in a variety of transactions. For ex-\nample, an individual is treated under Code\nSec. 318(a)(1) as constructively owning stock\nowned directly or indirectly by his or her\nspouse (unless legally separated), children,\ngrandchildren, or parents. Stock attribution\nrules under Code Sec. 318 apply when de-\ntermining whether a redemption of stock is\ntreated as a sale or exchange or as a dividend.\nLikewise, prohibited transactions involving\npension plans under Code Sec. 4975 are\ndefined, in part, upon dealing with certain\npersons, including spouses of those persons.\n\nIMPACT. The Supreme Court's grant of\nFederal marital status to same-sex married\n\npersons is apparently not only prospective\nstarting June 26, 2013, the date of the\nWindsor decision, but also presumably\napplies retroactively to all open years.\nNevertheless, in the case of attribution\nrules, application of marital status for\nsame-sex spouses may not necessarily re-\nlate back to transactions already com-\npleted. The need under the tax laws to\nhave finality for transactions as they oc-\ncur appears to be the overriding argument\nin favor of not giving retroactive effect to\nfamily attribution. Eventual IRS guid-\n\nance on this issue is anticipated.\n\nResident And Non-Resident Aliens. Pre-\nsumably, the Supreme Court’s decision ap-\nplies to same-sex resident or nonresident\naliens to the extent they are considered mar-\nried under the law of a foreign jurisdiction.\nFurther clarification of the application of\nthe Supreme Court’s Windsor decision to\nthese taxpayers may be needed.\n\nESTATE AND GIFT TAXATION\n\nThe Windsor case, as discussed above in this\nBriefing, involved the estate tax marital de-\nduction. The marital deduction is a key plan-\nning tool to defer transfer taxes until the\nsurviving spouse dies. Because of DOMA,\nsame-sex married couples could not take\nadvantage of the estate tax marital deduc-\ntion and other provisions, such as portabil-\nity. DOMA also precluded same-sex married\ncouples from the benefits of special rules for\ngifts between spouses and from spouses.\n\nMarital Deduction. Code Sec. 2056 provides\nan unlimited deduction from the gross estate\nfor property passing from a decedent to a sur-\nviving spouse. Generally, the decedent must\nbe survived by his or her spouse who is a U.S.\ncitizen at the time of the decedent’s death, the\nproperty interest must have passed from the\ndecedent to the spouse, and the property inter-\nest must be a deductible interest. Additionally,\nthe property's value must be ascertainable.\n\nIMPACT. The relatively high $5.25 mil-\nlion estate tax exclusion for 2013 for\nall estates makes addition of a marital\n\n©2013 CCH Incorporated. All Rights Reserved.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029310",
