  "text": "Remembering Dick Gregory\n\n| first met Dick Gregory when he asked me to interview him for 7he\nRealist in New York. | saw him again when | was in Chicago. He was\nperforming at the Playboy Club and invited me to his show. Two years\npreviously, Negro comedians performed only in Negro nightclubs, and\nGregory was no exception.\n\nBut one evening the regular white comic at the Playboy Club got\nsick, and Gregory took his place. It made 7ime magazine, and he was\ninvited to perform on the Jonight Show, but he declined unless, after\ndoing his stand-up act, he would be asked to sit down and talk with Jack\nPaar. The gamble worked, and Gregory became an instant celebrity,\nbreaking through the color barrier with humor.\n\nEventually we became friends and fellow demonstrators. Now he\nwas performing at the Playboy Club, not as a substitute comic but as a star\nattraction. They had to supply me with a jacket, and a tie that was\n\ndecorated all over with bunny symbols. Gregory was already on stage.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015390",
