Yes, I told you I can't have people\ncoming here to ask about you and ex pals.... My landlord may shoot them. He is pissed. I need your help. Out\nof all the people you should be helping is someone who actually genuinely cared about you.i realize you're\nliving the good life and I'm not your concern, but if you really appreciated my support then you'd help me\notherwise I don't know what I'll do.\n\nOn Wednesday, January 20, 2016, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\ni appreciate your support is what i meant. has anyting happened recently? it is my birthday today\n\nOn Tue, Jan 19, 2016 at 10:46 PM x i wrote:\nAppreciate what? I'm not sure you do. Be back for what? Where? I don't need to be photographed. I am trying\nto avoid that, hence the reason why I moved out here. I don't need people coming here looking for me to give\nthem information about you or the \"people\" I was documented with... It's not my property. I don't think you\nget it.\n\nOn Tuesday, January 19, 2016, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\ni appreciate it. I should be back feb 14,\n\nOn Tue, Jan 19, 2016 at 6:39 PM,\n\nBecause you were not available to meet me in person last year and at this point I don’t need to be seen. I can not have press,\nmedia, private investigators, film companies, etc. contacting me or my parents and sisters at home or on cell/texts and or by\n\nmail. I realize you don’t have much control over this, but you can at least help me to move. I can’t just get up and go like you. I\nleft the city to escape, make a better life and I am devastated these people found me and brought to light an association of that I\nwould rather them never to know. People think I was involved with something really bad and I lost a boyfriend of great potential\nover this shit. I am still in debt over all these years, been working my ass off trying to get ahead, which you could never\nunderstand I was even surviving off the pay I was getting. Well, its not any better. I dropped out of college because of you (and\nGM’s) advice. Started working for a company you wanted me to and basically my life has has become hell since then.\n\nI have been your supporter for 16 years, the media explosion with Clinton, Trump and Cosby is affecting me. I'm not prepared for\nthis.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
