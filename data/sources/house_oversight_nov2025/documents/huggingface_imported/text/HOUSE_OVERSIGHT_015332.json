Can't we all agree now to lower\nthe temperature on underwear?”\n\nSpeaking of lowering the temperature, in the Pittsburgh Post-\nGazette, editorial cartoonist Rob Rogers depicted the U.S. Civil Discourse\nGun Shop where a customer is asking the clerk: “Do you have anything\nversatile enough to go from a campaign breakfast to a protest march to a\nTown Hall meeting?” And in the Orlando Sentinal Dana Summers\ndepicted another gun store featuring semi-automatic 31-clip weapons,\nwhere the clerk is explaining to a customer: “Say you have thirty-one\nburglars break into your house.”\n\nOn the Monday following the tragic weekend, Jon Stewart was\nunable to find anything funny about it.
