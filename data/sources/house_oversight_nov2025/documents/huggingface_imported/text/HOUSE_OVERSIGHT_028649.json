  "text": "The international community is unlikely to concede to either more\nsanctions or the use of force until Iran's objections are taken into full\nconsideration. As such, a grand deal that is supposed to provoke a moment\nof clarity is likely to be enmeshed in the existing, protracted arms-control\nprocess.\n\nAnother complication is the advent of public opinion and critical\nconstituencies in Iran devoted to the perpetuation of the program. The\ngrowing public sentiment is that Iran has a right to acquire a nuclear\ncapability. As the program matures, it is becoming a source of pride for a\ncitizenry accustomed to the revolution's setbacks and failures.\n\nAlso emerging is a bureaucratic and scientific establishment with its own\nparochial considerations for sustaining the nuclear investment. A clerical\nleadership that is dealing with a restive population and empowered\nsecurity services cannot easily dispense with its nuclear trump card.\n\nAll this suggests that the best means of addressing Iran's nuclear challenge\nis to mitigate its most dangerous dimensions. The focus should remain on\nIran's high-grade enrichment and its underground nuclear facility nestled\nin mountains outside Qom. Tehran seems to have conceived an ingenious\npath to nuclear advancement, one that involves increasing the size and\nsophistication of its civilian atomic apparatus to the point where it can\nquickly surge into a bomb. While staying within the rules of the\nInternational Atomic Energy Agency's inspection process, Iran is\nessentially expanding its capabilities while shielding them under the\nveneer of legality. Given the fact that much of civilian nuclear technology\ncan easily be misappropriated for military purposes, Iran can construct an\nelaborate nuclear infrastructure while remaining within IAEA guidelines.\n\nThe diplomatic challenge is to derail this path to a nuclear weapon by\nimposing significant restraints on its program. And this can still be done\nthrough a process that proceeds incrementally and sequentially.\n\nUSS. officials would be wise to get out of the crisis mode and put some\ntime back on the clock. The Iran issue always seems urgent, and yet\nsomehow there is always time to deal with it. Washington should\nacknowledge the obvious, namely, that given Iran's gradualist approach, it\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028649",
