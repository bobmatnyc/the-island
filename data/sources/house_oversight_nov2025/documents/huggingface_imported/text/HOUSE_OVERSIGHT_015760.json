How can we know our\nexperience of the world is real?\n\nUnderstanding the World\n\nThe French philosopher Descartes gave us an explanation for this\nparadox. He spent a long time looking skeptically at everything we\nperceive. For example, when we poke a stick into a pond, the surface of\nthe water bends light and the stick appears to have a kink in it. Our eyes\ntell us the stick is bent, but our brain ‘knows’ the stick is straight: it’s an\nillusion. Descartes wondered if something so simple could be an illusion,\nperhaps the whole of our experience is too.\n\nHis eventual solution underpins much of modern philosophy - ‘T\nthink therefore I am, cogito ergo sum. Even if we doubt everything else,\nwe cannot doubt we are thinking about this doubt. At least we can rely\nupon the existence of this ‘thought’ as some reality. Descartes built up\nfrom this bedrock the real world we live in. We can be sure we experience\nthings and can apply logic and use thought. We can use this intellectual\nfaculty to tell a great deal about our Universe.\n\nTrue Understanding\n\nIn the QED lecture series, The Strange Thing about Light and Matter,\nRichard Feynman relates the story of the ancient Mayan astronomers.\n3000 years ago they were able to predict the motion of Venus in the sky\nusing only pebbles. They had a simple system that could predict when\nthe planet would rise over the horizon. Put a stone in the jar every day,\ntake out a stone once a week, add a stone at every new moon. If the\nnumber of stones in the jar is divisible by 23, Venus will rise. ’m making\nup the details but you see the idea... It’s a very simple algorithm. What\nshould we conclude if the Mayans had perfected their calculations to\npredict the motion of Venus and it proved reliable over a whole century?\nWould this constitute understanding?\n\nFeynman would say no: the Mayan understanding was not\ncomplete. It was only black box equivalent to our modern understanding\nover a limited period. We known that once the Sun begins to run out\nof fuel it will swell to a red giant and explode, destroying Venus and\nthe Earth. Their model could not predict this catastrophic failure. Our\nmodern deeper understanding of the workings of the solar system allows\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015760",
