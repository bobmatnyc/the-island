  "text": "devices that require repair. This allows for cool-headed, rational, and skillful surgeries, while fending off\nthe humanizing emotions of compassion and empathy. This is adaptive. This is a transformation that\nenables doctors working in war-torn areas or regions afflicted with a disease outbreak, to treat hundreds\nof suffering patients as if they were treating inert cars on an assembly line. Good doctors allow their\ncompassion and empathy to return as their patients regain awareness. Bad doctors maintain their cool,\ndetached manner, insensitive to the physical and psychological pain of their waking patients. Bad doctors\ncontinue to perceive their patients like cars on the assembly line. Really bad doctors see their patients like\ncars that were created for personal R&D.\n\nRecall from earlier sections that when we see someone else in pain, particular areas of the brain\nactivate as we imagine their suffering. Many of the same areas of the brain also activate when we\npersonally experience pain. This is the circuitry for pain empathy. The French cognitive neuroscientist\nJean Decety showed that when physicians look at video clips of people experiencing pain from a needle\nprick, this circuit is suppressed relative to non-physicians. For physicians, it’s as if they were watching a\nneedle prick a pillow. Though we don’t know how much experience was necessary or sufficient to cause\nthe physician’s lack of pain empathy, or the extent to which physicians are physicians because they were\nborn with less empathy, Decety’s findings point to individual differences in our capacity to feel what\nothers feel and the potential modulating role of experience.\n\nSeveral studies now show that based on individual experience, the human brain readily flip-flops\nbetween empathy and callousness. In two similarly designed experiments, one recording from pain related\nareas in the brain, and the other from a motor area associated with the hand, Caucasian and Black subjects\nwatched a video of a needle penetrating a human hand. Consistently, subjects showed weaker activation\nin the pain and motor areas when watching the needle penetrate the hand from another race. This lowering\nof pain empathy and motor response for the out-group was greatest for subjects with the highest implicit\nor unconscious racial biases, as measured with the IAT tool noted earlier.\n\nThese studies of the brain, like the behavioral studies I discussed earlier, add to the idea that we\nhave a racial bias for pain empathy. We feel others’ pain, but only for those who share the same race. But\nsince, by definition, we look more like those from within our racial group than those outside it, perhaps\nthe bias is less about race and more about those that don’t look like us. To explore this possibility, Black\nand Caucasian subjects saw a needle penetrate a violet-colored hand. Violet hands are not only different,\nbut far more different than either black or white hands in terms of our experience of skin coloration.\nNonetheless, the activation pattern in the brain matched the subject’s own race. When we feel less\ncompassion for someone of another race, it is because of racial biases, not because of superficial\n\ndifferences in appearance. Color is simply a cue that reminds us of our prejudice.\n\nHauser Chapter 3. Ravages of denial 104\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012850",
