  "text": "16\n\nsee Colonel Qaddafi gone, he also said that the air war was unlikely\nto accomplish that by itself. Most important, he vowed that there\nwould be no American ground troops in this fight. “If we tried to\noverthrow Qaddafi by force,” he said, “our coalition would splinter.”\nHe said “regime change” in Iraq took eight years and cost thousands\nof American and Iraqi lives. “That is not something we can afford to\nrepeat in Libya.” Instead, he said the United States and its allies\nwould work to increase the diplomatic and military pressure on\nColonel Qaddafi and his cronies. A meeting on Tuesday with allies\nand members of the Libyan opposition is supposed to develop that\nstrategy along with ways to help the rebels build alternate, and we\nhope humane and competent, governing structures. That needs to\nstart quickly. To hold their ground and protect endangered civilians,\nlet alone advance, the rebels will likely need air support for quite\nsome time. Mr. Obama was right not to promise a swift end to the air\ncampaign. At the same time, he should not overestimate the patience\nof the American people or the weariness of the overstretched military.\nAnd as Washington reduces its military role, others, inside and\noutside NATO, will need to increase theirs. Within NATO,\nunenthusiastic partners like Germany and Turkey need to at least stay\nout of the way even if they continue to stand aside from the fighting.\nThe president made the right choice to act, but this is a war of choice,\nnot necessity. Presidents should not commit the military to battle\nwithout consulting Congress and explaining their reasons to the\nAmerican people. Fortunately, initial coalition military operations\nhave gone well. Unfortunately, it is the nature of war that they will\nnot always go well. Mr. Obama needs to work with Congress and\nkeep the public fully informed. On Monday, he made an overdue start\non that.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030045",
