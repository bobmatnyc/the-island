He was a Soviet Jew who I never even met during the years I was fighting\nto save his life. His name (at the time) was Anatoly Sharansky (now Natan Sharansky).\n\nSharansky was a prominent and vocal defender of human rights, not only of his fellow Soviet\nJews but of all victims of Soviet oppression. He worked closely with Andrei Saklarov, the father\nof the Soviet nuclear weapons program who had become the leading voice for human rights in the\nSoviet Union.\n\nSharansky was arrested by the Soviet KGB in 2003 [check] on charges of spying for the United\nStates—a charge that carried the death penalty. I had previously represented two Jewish\nRefusenicks who had tried to steal a small airplane in which to escape to Israel, via Sweden. They\nhad been sentenced to death, so I knew that the threat of capital punishment against Sharansky\nwas real. Their death sentences against were later reversed and they were eventually allowed to\nemigrate to Israel. But there was no assurance that similar efforts would help Sharansky, who\nfaced the more serious charge of spying for an enemy.\n\nI had been asked, along with Canadian law professor Irwin Cotler, to represent Sharanksy. The\nrequest came from his wife, who was in Israel, and his mother, who lived in Moscow. They had\nno money to pay for a lawyer. We agreed to do what we could to save his life and, hopefully,\nsecure his freedom.\n\nOur first job was to try to get the espionage charge dropped, since that was the one that carried\nthe death sentence. Because Sharanksy was accused of spying for the United States, I decided to\ngo directly to the White House to try to persuade President Carter to issue a statement expressly\ndenying the Soviet charge that Sharansky had been a CIA operative. We faced great pressure\nfrom the CIA to continue the longstanding American policy of never affirming or denying\nanyone’s alleged association with the agency. But after several requests, President Carter did\nissue the following statement:\n\nI have inquired deeply within the State Department and within the CIA, as to whether or\nnot Mr. Sharanksy has ever had any known relationship in a subversive way, or otherwise,\nwith the CIA. The answer is “no.” We have double-checked this, and I have been\nhesitant to make that public announcement, but now I am completely convinced.\n\nShortly after President Carter made his unprecedented statement, the Soviet prosecutors dropped\nthe espionage charge and took the death penalty off the table. But they were still determined to\nsee Sharansky die in prison. The Soviets called it “special regime” imprisonment, consisting of a\ndiet that no one could long survive. The prisoners called it “death on the installment plan.”\n\nSharansky’s wife pleaded with me to get him out of prison before he starved to death and before\n\nshe was too old to have children. We had saved him from execution; now we had to save him\nfrom starvation. We had our work cut out for us.\n\n204\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017291",
