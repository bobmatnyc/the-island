  "text": "52\n\nPromote Integrity\n\nBeAlert to Risks The primary risk is of inappropriate influence over admissions,\ncourse content, and program activities stemming from the influence of Chinese\ngovernment-linked donors, diplomatic missions, student groups, and institutions.\nThis is not a new challenge for US university administrators and development officers.\nThey have dealt with political quid pro quos from donors from South Korea, Taiwan,\nJapan, Israel, Russia, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and other countries in the past and\ncurrently, and American universities have long learned how to refuse donations with\nstrings attached. This historical experience and the existing safeguards should also\nhelp inform and guide US universities when it comes to dealing with this new wave of\nChinese money. Faculty and administrators must continue to protect the open debate,\ndiversity of opinion, freedom of expression, faculty autonomy, and transparency on\nwhich the health and reputation of their institutions are based. Funding from Chinese\nsources should be as welcome as funding from other sources, but only to the extent\nthat fundamental academic values can be maintained and protected.\n\nA second risk is a loss of sensitive or proprietary technology through academic\ninstruction of cooperation. There are indications that the US government is now\nstrengthening measures to protect the theft of sensitive technology and intellectual\nproperty that is being developed on US campuses. These measures may require\nheightened screening and, in some cases, outright denial of visas to individuals from\ncertain state-run institutions or even from certain sensitive research fields. Such\n\ncalls have understandably prompted concern from the academic community fearing\nthat this will undermine the principles of academic freedom, hinder collaboration,\nand deny American universities access to a rich talent pool. These reservations are\nmerited and require that any tightening of visa categories be as narrow as possible.\nFor their part, universities will of course have to comply with whatever regulations are\nimposed. They should, additionally, proactively review and update their procedures\nfor protecting both proprietary and classified research. They should also enter into\nfar closer collegial discussions with one another, relevant professional associations,\nand government agencies to collectively refine solutions to the difficult problem of\nbalancing the pursuit of innovation and academic freedom with preventing the theft\nof technology and other IP.\n\nTo meet these challenges, American universities may need to update their rules and\nintensify faculty and researcher training and institutional oversight for protection of\nproprietary research information. Some US universities refuse to accept contracts for\nclassified research. Those that do accept such contracts must comply with government\nregulations for the protection of research findings. But all research universities\nconduct research that produces valuable intellectual property, which is proprietary\n\nin various proportions to the funder. And so, it is necessary for the university and\n\nUniversities\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020511",
