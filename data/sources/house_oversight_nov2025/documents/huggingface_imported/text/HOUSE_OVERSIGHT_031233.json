[jeevacation@gmail.com]\nSubject: Fwd: URGENT: BuzzFeed News inquiry re allegations of sexual harassment\n\nAttachments: DA866543-7401-4A5A-8E50-FD32E33A50EC.png\n\nImportance: — High\nOK.. Here it is... suggestions?\n\n1. Item 1: I did neck with that woman, but never forced myself on her, and we talked about kissing or going\nbeyond that and decided not to.\n\n2. Item 2: This was what I told you about.. A student who came to me for advice about science\ncommunication.. I never approached her, or did anything, and have emails rebuffing her requests to meet off\ncampus for coffee or meals.. not because they were suggestive, but because I didn’t think it was appropriate. I\ndid ask her about being a female in a male dominated physics major group because I wanted to find out what\nproblems might be occurring. Iwas respectful of her, and in fact my wife and I gave her a lift later ata AAAS\nmeeting that I had helped get her a fellowship to attend. I was shocked later to learn that she had\n\ncomplained. There was no official investigation.. no formal complaint lodged.. When I spoke to the Dean and\ntold her the above, including showing emails, it was agreed that there would be no formal complaint but\nbecause the student had been upset I would not interact with her at all. I was shocked and dismayed, as I had\nworked very hard to be supportive and mentor this girl\n\n3. Item 3: I have no idea about this.\n\n4. This never happened.. In March 2008 at the convention I was approached by a student who did ask to sit at a\ntable with the then executive director of the Dawkins foundation. She asked me to join her in the hot tub. I said\nnow. Afterwards the exec. director informed me that this person was complaining that I had harassed her, and\nshe told me as she was there at the time she would be more than happy to explain that it was quite the opposite.\n\n5. This was a cruise with Nancy, who was my female companion. When that report appeared I explained that\nmy wife Nancy was upset at the allegation as she was my companion and such a complaint could be considered\nlibelous. the complaint was removed from the bloggers web site. Moreover, CFI not only continued to invite\nme on cruises but to speak at their events, including this year, where they have strict harassment policies. I\ncontinue to receive letters of thanks from them for my contributions, attitude, graciousness etc.. No complaints\never. Not one!\n\n6. This one you know about.\nShall we talk?\nLMK\n\nLawrence M.
