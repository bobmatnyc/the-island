(Family issues today -\nmother 102 in May.)\n\nRADICAL BREAKTHROUGHS - Initial Revisions (working model for discussion, red is new)\n\nExpand and Modify Mathematical Breakthrough episodes\n1. Mathematics and Truth / Overview / Show Excitement/Importance\n2. Mathematical Fields / Diverse New Kinds and Categories\n\n3. How Math Works in Disparate Areas of Knowledge (from fundamental physics to chemistry,\nbiology [molecular and evolutionary|, psychology, sociology, economics, etc.)\n\n4. Power Laws\n5. Mathematical Biology\n\n6. Foundations of Mathematics / Philosophy/Meaning of Math (discovered/invented?)\n\nADD/Exchange to Biological Breakthrough episodes\n\n9/10.
