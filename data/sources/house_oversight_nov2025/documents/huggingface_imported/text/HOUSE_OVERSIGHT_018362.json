If there was ever a\ngroup you might hope to take aside, pull into a quiet room and ask gently What are\nthe really networks for, anyway? this would be it.\n\nThe act of keeping time, of marking it, is embedded in the nature of any age. Our\nlives are, after all, dictated by timetables: School schedules, the seasons, rush hour,\nthe burning candle of birth-love-marriage-death. Time, in the days before industry,\nwas measured by nature’s schedule. How long it took a crop to mature. The\nsolstices. A beehive filling with honey. It was marked by moving tides and shifting\nseasons, and it demanded a slowness, a personal presence on the shores, in the\noceans, atop the fields over generations. “Summer afternoon,” the novelist Henry\nJames remarked in a précis of a slower age he felt passing away in 1895. “To me\nthose have always been the two most beautiful words in the English language.” 18°\n\nThen, in the industrial revolution, time became money. Electric lights, for instance,\nundid the restful distinction between night and day - and made 24-hour life and\nmanufacturing and economics possible and then, of course, inevitable. Movement\nfrom countryside to city established a really new sense of what the German critic\nGeorg Simmel, writing in 1903, called tempo. “With each crossing of the street, with\nthe tempo and multiplicity of economic, occupational and social life, the city sets up\na deep contrast with small town and rural life,” he explained. “The technique of\nmetropolitan life is unimaginable without the most punctual integration of all\nactivities and mutual relations into a stable and impersonal time schedule.”18! Punch\ncards. Bus schedules. The forty hour work week. Our education, our manufacturing,\nour markets and our lives all began to run on timetables. They had to, or the whole\nproject of industry would collapse. “Summer Afternoon” became a time to work.\nSimmel worried, for instance, over the diffusion of pocket watches. To carry one was\nlike looking at a constantly draining bank account.\n\nThis sense of humans reduced to cogs - churned, run, disposed of on a schedule not\ntheir own - unnerved the residents of that first mechanical age. Cities had been the\nvery first sorts of tight-packed networks; industrial cities ratcheted this further still.\nThey succeeded and failed by the degree to which they geared themselves and their\ncitizens to machine speed. When the Austrian novelist Robert Musil began The Man\nWithout Qualities, his classic story of the era, with the flattening of a Viennese citizen\nby a speeding delivery truck, he meant to point out how urban speed and urban life\n(and urban death) had become inseparable. And also the mismatch between the\nweak breaks of the age and it’s acceleration. The book is alive with that pre-accident\nslipping sensation you may have had: You are pressing hard on the brakes of the car;\nyou are going to hit something anyhow. “Cities can be recognized by their pace just\nas people can by their walk,” Musil wrote in a line that any modern New Yorker or\n\n180 “Summer afternoon”: Edith Wharton, A Backwards Glance, (New York: D.\nAppleton-Century, 1934) See chapter 10 for her tale of an afternoon with James.\n181 “With each crossing”: Georg Simmel, “The Metropolis and Mental Life” (1903)\nin Gary Bridge and Sophie Watson, eds.
