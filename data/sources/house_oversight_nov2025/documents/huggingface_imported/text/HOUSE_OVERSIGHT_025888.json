Praluent is likely to be \nmore widely used, and to cost more, than Wall Steet analysts expected. That also means it could be a big cost \ndown the line. \n\"Obviously, the class is one of the biggest developments in cardiology in the last decade, that will allow us to \ntreat patients who have been extremely difficult to treat with high levels of LDL cholesterol,\" says Steven \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025888 \nNissen, chairman of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. \"It's very promising.\" \nBut it will also be very expensive, say Troy Brennan, the chief medical officer of CVS Caremark, the giant \npharmacy benefits manager.\"If these drugs are used as broadly as they could be used, they are going to be by far \nthe most expensive drug class,\" Brennan says. \nPraluent, an injection, lowers low-density lipoprotein, the so-called \"bad cholesterol\", by as much as 60%, far \nmore than the statin drugs alone. It is the first drug to work by targeting a protein called PCSK9. Mutations in \nthe gene that makes it can result in patients having lower cholesterol and a dramatically lower lifetime risk of \nheart attacks. A rival medicine from Amgen is also expected to be approved soon. The FDA is clearing Praluent \nfor patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, a genetic condition that causes high cholesterol, \nand for people who have heart disease, like those who've had heart attacks or strokes, who are already taking \nthe maximum dose of a statin they can tolerate. \nRegeneron and its marketing partner Sanofi say Praluent will have a wholesale cost of $40 a day, or $14,600 a \nyear, for either of two doses, 75 milligrams or 150 mgs. It's likely that insurance companies will get a \nsignificant discount, because Amgen and Regeneron will compete by giving the insurers rebates. \nRecommended by Forbes \nMost Popular \nPhotos: America's New Manufacturing Boomtowns \n4111-% \nMost Popular \nBarrel Rolling With A Thrillionaire Entrepreneur \nMost Popular \nPhotos: The 10 Best And Worst States To Make A Living In 2015 \nTrending on LinkedIn \nDonald Trump And The Decline Of American Character--A Cautionary Tale \n74-.M0r. \nMost Popular \nPhotos: America's New Manufacturing Boomtowns \nMost Popular \nBarrel Rolling With A Thrillionaire Entrepreneur \nMost Popular \nPhotos: The 10 Best And Worst States To Make A Living In 2015 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025889 \nTrending on LinkedIn \nDonald Trump And The Decline Of American Character--A Cautionary Tale \n\"We don't want the noise about these drugs to be price,\" says Leonard Schleifer, the chief executive and \nfounder of Regeneron. \"We have to make sure that people get access to the drug for a fair price if they're \ninsured, for free if they're not insured, or at a discount if they're under-insured.\" \nPraluent's price is 46% higher than that forecast by Evercore ISI, an investment bank, and it is being approved \nfor a larger group of patients than many Wall Street analysts expected following a meeting convened by the \nFDA to analyze the data on the drug. Some doctors argued its use should be restricted mainly to patients with \nFH. But Mark Schoenebaum, Evercore ISI's pharmaceutical analyst, says that investors were initially \ndisappointed because they had hoped the FDA would greenlight the drug for an even broader group. Regeneron \nshares were down 2.5% in afternoon trading before they were halted pending news. \nBut doctors may prescribe the drug more widely than the label suggests. A survey of physicians published this \nmorning by Geoffrey Porges, an biotechnology analyst at investment bank Sanford C. Bernstein, found that they \nwould use the drug in 30% to 40% of patients who had already had heart attacks. He wrote that 2020 sales of \nPraluent could be as high as $4.8 billion. \nIn the survey, doctors expressed a preference for Praluent. One advantage of Regeneron's drug is that doctors \nwill be able to start it at a lower, 75 milligram dose. \nSchleifer, who is a medical doctor and, incidentally, a billionaire thanks to his Regeneron stake, says that the \ncompany expects that as many as 8 million people who don't have their cholesterol well-controlled could be \ncandidates for Praluent. He emphasized, though, that until larger studies prove the drug prevents heart attacks \nand strokes patients should always choose statins first. It will have sales representatives a \nInsurance companies and pharmacy benefit managers, who help insurers and employers manage drug costs, are \ngoing to do their best to restrict use of Praluent, though. Brennan, the CVS Caremark executive, says that he \nexpects patients will need to have medical records documenting that they have already taken statins. Those not \ntaking statins would need a blood test confirming that a statin caused elevations in muscle or liver enzymes, not \njust complaints that they were achy. \"We're not trying to replace statins,\" says Schliefer, the Regeneron CEO. \nMost people who have muscle problems from statins do not have those elevated muscle enzymes, says Nissen, \nthe Cleveland Clinic cardiologist, who is conducting a clinical trial Amgen and Pfizer, which is also developing \na similar cholesterol drug. He says he has patients who are \"desperate\" to take a statin but who cannot tolerate \nit because of muscle pain but do not have elevated muscle enzymes. \n\"Dehspite significant progress over the last decades, high cholesterol remains a leading concern in the U.S. and \nglobally,\" said Olivier Brandicourt, M.D., Chief Executive Officer, Sanofi. \"Praluent demonstrates the power of \nthe Sanofi and Regeneron alliance to deliver a first-in-class therapy in the U.S. for patients in need. Sanofi has a \nstrong cardiovascular heritage and dedication to these patients, and we look forward to working with other \nregulatory authorities to make Praluent available to patients worldwide.\" \n\"We are grateful to the thousands of patients and investigators worldwide who participated in the ODYSSEY \nclinical trial program,\" said Leonard S. Schleifer, M.D., Ph.D., Founder, President, and Chief Executive Officer, \nRegeneron. \"Praluent represents the culmination of more than a decade of tireless work to translate the genetic-\nbased discovery of PCSK9 into an innovative medicine that brings meaningful value to patients.\" \nThe approval of Praluent was based on data from the pivotal Phase 3 ODYSSEY program, which showed \nconsistent, positive results compared to placebo, which included current standard of care therapy (statins). In the \nODYSSEY LONG TERM trial which evaluated Praluent 150 mg every two weeks, Praluent reduced LDL \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025890 \ncholesterol by 58 percent versus placebo at week 24 when added to current standard of care, including \nmaximally tolerated statins. In ODYSSEY COMBO I, Praluent 75 mg every two weeks as an adjunct to statins \nreduced LDL cholesterol by an additional 46 percent compared to placebo at week 12. At week 24 in the same \ntrial, Praluent reduced LDL cholesterol by 43 percent compared to placebo. In this study, if additional LDL \ncholesterol lowering was required based on pre-specified criteria at week 8, Praluent was up-titrated to 150 mg \nat week 12 for the remainder of the trial. Eighty-three percent of patients remained on their initial 75 mg dose. \nPraluent is generally well-tolerated with an acceptable safety profile. Local injection site reactions including \nredness, itching, swelling or pain/tenderness where the injection is given were the most common events (7.2 \npercent with Praluent versus 5.1 percent with placebo) and resulted in a low discontinuation rate that was \ncomparable to placebo (0.2 percent with Praluent versus 0.4 percent with placebo). Patients receiving Praluent \nhad a greater number of injection site reactions, had more reports of associated symptoms, and had reactions of \nlonger average duration than patients receiving placebo. Other common adverse events occurring more \nfrequently in patients with Praluent than placebo included symptoms of the common cold and flu or flu-like \nsymptoms. \nThe companies carefully considered the potential medical value that Praluent offers patients in determining the \nWholesale Acquisition Cost (WAC). The U.S. WAC price of Praluent is $40 per day ($1,120 every 28 days) for \nboth the 75 mg and 150 mg doses, making Praluent the lowest priced patient-administered monoclonal antibody \ntherapy on an annualized basis. Actual costs to patients, payers and health systems are anticipated to be lower as \nWAC pricing does not reflect discounts or rebates. Out-of-pocket costs to patients will vary depending on \ninsurance status and eligibility for patient assistance. \nSanofi and Regeneron are committed to ensuring that patients in the U.S. who are prescribed Praluent are able \nto access the medicine and receive the support they may need. The companies will launch a comprehensive \nprogram that offers support, training and follow up for patients at every step of the process. The program will \nprovide patient assistance to uninsured or underinsured patients, including providing free medicine to eligible \npatients, and can help identify coverage options for out-of-pocket costs. Additional services include educational \ninformation, clinical support for physicians, nurses and pharmacists, as well as reimbursement services, \nincluding co-pay support for eligible patients and information about insurance eligibility support.

The European \nCommission (EC) is expected to make a final decision on the Marketing Authorization Application for Praluent \nin the European Union in September 2015. \nInvestor Relations Conference Call on Praluent \nSanofi and Regeneron will be hosting a conference call for the financial community on Praluent® (alirocumab) \nInjection for the treatment of high LDL cholesterol in adult patients. The conference call will take place on \nFriday, July 24, 2015 (21:30 CET / 20:30 BST/ 15:30 EDT / 12:30 PDT). \nThe call will be available through audio webcast at www.sanofi.com and www.regeneron.com and also via the \nfollowing telephone numbers: \nFrance: \n+33 (0) 1 70 80 71 53 \nUK: \n431,4 \n+44 (0) 203 107 0289 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 025891 \nU.S.: \n+1 888 660 6127 \nAccess code: 81662098 \nODYSSEY Program \nThe ODYSSEY Phase 3 program is one of the most comprehensive clinical trial programs ever conducted for \nan investigational LDL cholesterol lowering therapy. The program includes 14 global Phase 3 trials evaluating \nmore than 23,500 patients. The primary efficacy end point in all of the studies was the mean percent reduction \nfrom baseline in LDL cholesterol at week 24 compared to placebo (maximally tolerated statin therapy); all of \nthe completed studies met their primary endpoint. A significantly higher proportion of patients achieved LDL \ncholesterol of less than 70 mg/dL in the Praluent group as compared to placebo at both week 12 and week 24. \nThe ongoing ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial will prospectively evaluate the cardiovascular benefits of Praluent \nin approximately 18,000 patients. \nImportant Safety Information \nDo not use PRALUENT if you are allergic to alirocumab or to any of the ingredients in PRALUENT. \nBefore you start using PRALUENT, tell your healthcare provider about all your medical conditions, including \nallergies, and if you are pregnant or plan to become pregnant or if you are breastfeeding or plan to breastfeed. \nTell your healthcare provider or pharmacist about any prescription and over-the-counter medicines you are \ntaking or plan to take, including natural or herbal remedies. \nPRALUENT can cause serious side effects, including allergic reactions that can be severe and require treatment \nin a hospital.
