  "text": "314 17 A Preschool-Based Roadmap to Advanced AGI\n\ne Appropriate Social Behavior\n— Example task: The robot should learn to clean up and put away its toys when it’s\ndone playing with them.\ne Social Communication\n— Example task: The robot should greet new human entrants into the lab, but if it\nknows the new entrants very well and it’s busy, it may eschew the greeting\ne Social Inference about simple social relationships\n— Example task: The robot should infer that Cassio and Ben are friends because they\noften enter the lab together, and often talk to each other while they are there\nGroup Play at loosely-organized activities\n— Example task: The robot should be able to participate in “informally kicking a ball\naround” with a few people, or in informally collaboratively building a structure with\nblocks\n\n12. Communication\n\ne Gestural communication to achieve goals and express emotions\n— Example task: If the robot is asked where the red ball is, it should be able to show\nby pointing its hand or finger\nVerbal communication using English in its life-context\n— Example tasks: Answering simple questions, responding to simple commands, de-\nscribing its state and observations with simple statements\nPictorial Communication regarding objects and scenes it is familiar with\n— Example task: The robot should be able to draw a crude picture of a certain tower\nof blocks, so that e.g the picture looks different for a very tall tower and a wide low\none\ne Language acquisition\n— Example task: The robot should be able to learn new words or names via people\nuttering the words while pointing at objects exemplifying the words or names\nCross-modal communication\n— Example task: If told to \"touch Bob’s knee\" but the robot doesn’t know what a\nknee is, being shown a picture of a person and pointed out the knee in the picture\nshould help it figure out how to touch Bob’s knee\n\n13. Quantitative\n\ne Counting sets of objects in its environment\n— Example task: The robot should be able to count small (homogeneous or heteroge-\nneous) sets of objects\ne Simple, grounded arithmetic with small numbers\n— Example task: Learning simple facts about the sum of integers under 10 via teaching,\nreinforcement and imitation\ne Comparison of observed entities regarding quantitative properties\n— Example task: Ability to answer questions about which object or person is bigger\nor taller\ne Measurement using simple, appropriate tools\n— Example task: Use of a yardstick to measure how long something is\n\n14.
