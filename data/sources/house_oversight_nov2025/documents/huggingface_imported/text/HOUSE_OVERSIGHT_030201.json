  "text": "(I should note that the U.S. Attorney’s manual cautions against naming persons as\nunindicted co-conspirators “[i}]n the absence of some significant justification.” Here, of\ncourse, the “significant justification” would exist if a sitting president is the only individual\nin the country who is immune from indictment. Thus, for that individual alone, the usual\nbetter course of indictment would not be available.)\n\nHere I want to review each of the half-dozen times that the executive branch has addressed\nthe question of whether a president can be prosecuted, indicted or included as an unindicted\nco-conspirator. The opinions that conclude that a president cannot be indicted deal mainly\nwith the question of whether a president can be put on trial. While the discussions of the\noption of indicting but postponing trial are more than a mere afterthought, that option was\nnot the focus of the opinions and received scant analysis.\n\nThe relevant briefs and memoranda are:\n\nThe Sept. 24, 1973, OLC Dixon memo\n\nThe Oct. 5, 1973, brief for the United States in Jn re Agnew\n\nThe Feb. 12, 1974, memorandum to Independent Counsel Leon Jaworski\nThe June 21, 1974, reply brief for the United States in U.S. v. Nixon\n\nThe May 13, 1998, memorandum to Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr\nThe Oct. 16, 2000, OLC memorandum\n\nThese documents are worth review not only for their value as precedent but also for the\nextensive argumentation they contain on the pertinent issues.\n\n1. The Sept. 24, 1973, OLC Dixon Memo. This memo, signed by the head of the Office of\nLegal Counsel, Robert Dixon, is a procedural anomaly: It was not addressed to any official\nand may not have been made public at the time. It was not mentioned in the submission by\nthe solicitor general two weeks later in the Jn re Agnew case.\n\nAn PWN\n\nDixon noted that there was no express provision of the Constitution conferring any\nimmunity upon the president. The “proper approach” he wrote, “is to find the proper balance\nbetween the normal functions of the courts and the special responsibilities ... of the\nPresidency.” He concluded that “criminal proceedings against a President in office should\nnot go beyond a point where they could result in so serious a physical interference with the\nPresident’s performance of his official duties that it would amount to an incapacitation.”\nThus, “a necessity to defend a criminal trial and to attend court ... would interfere with the\nPresident’s unique official duties.”\n\nFinally, Dixon addressed “a possibility not yet mentioned”: that a sitting president could be\nindicted but further proceedings could be deferred until he was no longer in office. Unlike\nplacing a president on trial, this would not result in a “physical interference” with the\npresident’s duties. Nevertheless, the memo concludes that this step should not be taken\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030201",
