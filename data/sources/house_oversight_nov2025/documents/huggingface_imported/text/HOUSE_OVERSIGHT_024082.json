  "text": "Regulatory Changes\n\nOn June 22, 2011, to implement provisions of Title IV of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) adopted\nfinal rules implementing new exemptions from the registration requirements of the Investment\nAdvisers Act of 1940 (the “Advisers Act’), one of which is commonly known as the venture\ncapital fund exemption. Neither the General Partner nor the Management Company is currently\nexpected to register as an investment adviser with the SEC in reliance on the venture capital\nfund exemption. The General Partner may need to take into consideration certain conditions\nregarding the nature of investments that may be made by investment vehicles advised by an\ninvestment adviser relying on the venture capital exemption, which may constrain the Fund’s\ninvestment flexibility or require certain non-qualifying investments to be disposed of earlier\nthan they might otherwise be. In addition, compliance with the venture capital fund exemption\nmay subject the Fund to limitations on the Fund’s operations, including limitations on the\nFund’s ability to borrow, provide guarantees and make short-term investments that are more\nrestrictive than any limitation set forth in the Partnership Agreement.\n\nReliance on the venture capital exemption also will necessitate reporting certain information to\nthe SEC about the Management Company, the General Partner and their affiliates and may\nresult in such entities being subject to SEC examination authority and certain Advisers Act\ncompliance obligations. If the General Partner and the Management Company are able to rely\non the venture capital exemption, investors in the Fund will not be entitled to the benefits of\ncertain protections under the Advisers Act. If the General Partner or the Management Company\ncannot rely on the venture capital exemption, the General Partner or the Management Company\nmay need to register as an investment adviser under the Advisers Act. Registration under, and\ncompliance with, the Advisers Act could be costly and could divert attention of the Fund’s\nmanagement team. There also can be no assurance that statutory, regulatory, judicial or\nadministrative interpretations of existing laws and regulations will not in the future impose\nmore comprehensive or stringent requirements on the General Partner or the Management\nCompany.\n\nCautionary Statements Regarding Forward-Looking Statements.
