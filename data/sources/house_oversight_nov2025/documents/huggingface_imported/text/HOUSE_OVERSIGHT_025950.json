  "text": "grammatical structure, which the brain simply invents (there are only a few ways in which a natural language\ncan work). That is much easier to wire into a brain than a specific circuit.\n\nimy self believe that african music, westrn music , chinese music are a window into the the structure of those\nlayers. . western rigid, african primitve , chinese nature based,. I belive that synphoic movments best\ndescribe your layering. they open with a basic simple melody, , after it is learned , it is repeated and \"\ndeveloped\" , inverted, distorted, related, etc. the development stage take a long time. then there is a\nrecapitlaltion of the whole. and its inter and intra actions. . african musci has lots of beats. and little\ndevelopment. -no accident, it mirrors their learning process.\n\nInteresting question if music is somehow indicative of genetically defined prefs, but I am not sure. It could be\npath effects, starting in culture.\n\nre taboo\n, maybe climate change is a good way of dealing with overpopulation. . the earths forest fire. potentailly a\ngood thing for the species\n\nMaking having children expensive in terms of upbringing and missed opportunity (like in the west) is a more\nhumane way. Environmental stress while leaving near rock bottom tends to lead people to have more children,\nbecause there is no missed opportunity, and high mortality requires more attempts at procreation. Humans are a\nhardy species, outside of focused famine events and wars only small fractions of any given population die.\n\nI suspect that strong reductions in population will come from large-scale failure of agriculture. The climate\nchange itself with result in migration and wars, but most people will probably survive that. But who knows, I\nmight be wrong.\n\ntoo many people, so many mass executions of the elderly and infirm make sense\nis the fundamental fact that everyone dies at some time .make it imporrisbole to ask so why not earilier. if\nthe brain discards unused neurons , why shold socieity keep their equivalent\n\nThe radical idea of treating individuals in a society as cells and the society itself as a well-organized organism is\nfascism, or course. Probably the most efficient and rationally stringent way of governance, if someone could\npull it off in a sustainable way; and if it is aggressive and expansive, its efficiency makes it a virus that\neverybody will want to stomp out. Fascism makes romantic doo-gooders like me very uncomfortable (I visited\nKZ Buchenwald five times and it had a profound influence on me; we East Germans inoculated ourselves very\nthoroughly against fascism), and the general public will not be willing to consider it.\n\nI rather like the treatment Fascism gets in the Amazon Series \"The Man in the High Castle\", which explores\nwhat would have happened if the Germans and Japanese had won the war: A society that tries to function as a\nbrutal and ruthlessly efficient machine, eliminating all social and evolutionary slack. It is very dark, but not a\nflat caricature of pointless evil for its own sake. Heinlein's late book \"Starship Troopers” explores fascism, too,\nbut unlike Philipp K Dick he does not see it as a form of insanity, but as the most desirable order.\n\nI find your \"political incorrectness\" very fascinating. In the beginning, I thought it is a form of costly signaling,\nbut now I think you are simply entirely unconstrained in your thoughts. How did you manage in your youth?\nDid you get in trouble, or did you keep your thoughts to yourself? I wonder what kind of person you want to\ntransform into.\n\nIt was interesting to notice that at the Forbidden Research conference, nobody managed to say anything\nremotely out-of line. One large discussion group wanted to address the question of whether \"democracy still\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025950",
