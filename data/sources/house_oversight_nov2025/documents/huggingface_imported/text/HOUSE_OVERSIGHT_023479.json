Yet no one takes a larger view and\nasks, for example, whether existing aid programs are helping to keep\nthe regime in power or, conversely, are destabilizing it.\n\nEgypt itself presents a good case of this particular form of policy\nincoherence. Despite the fact that Egypt ranks as one of the top\nAmerican aid recipients, it is hard to say that Washington was\npursuing development goals of any sort there.
