According to researchers\nat the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies, open\nsources indicate that there are at least four, and potentially five,\nchemical weapons production facilities in Syria. One or two are\nlocated near Damascus, the other three situated in Hama, Latakia, and\nal-Safira village, near the city of Aleppo. Hama is one of the hotbeds\nof the Syrian revolt, which Assad's tanks attacked in early August and\nwhere, more recently, fighting has severely damaged the city's\nhospitals. Latakia is another center of unrest; it was shelled by the\nSyrian Navy in mid-August. Aleppo, Syria's second-largest city has\nalso seen significant demonstrations.\n\nIf anti-Assad insurgents take up arms, the chemical sites, as symbols\nof regime's authority, could become strategic targets. And, if mass\ndefections occur from the Syrian army, there may be no one left to\ndefend the sites against seizure. This could lead to disastrous\noutcomes -- including confiscation of the chemical weapons by a\nradical new national government, or sale of the weapons as war booty\nto organized non-state actors or criminal groups.\n\nIn such chaos, no one can predict who might control the weapons or\nwhere they might be taken. With these chemical weapons in the\nhands of those engaged in a possible civil war, the risks that they\nwould be used would increase substantially. The problem would be\nworsened further if some possessors were not fully aware of the\nextent of the weapons' deadly effects.\n\nAnd let's imagine that Assad is eventually removed: What leaders\nwould gain control of these weapons after he departed? Saudi-backed\nSunni groups? Iran-backed Shia organizations? Whoever they might\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031933",
