  "text": "\"Do you trust me?” I asked him.\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Absolutely.\"\n\nI clenched my nails into Mica's side, and his back arched. It was the clearest invitation I'd\nseen from him and, I suspected, the clearest invitation he knew how to give. If he even\nknew that he was giving it. It can take a lot of time and experience for a submissive to\nlearn what they want well enough to give good feedback for it. It's one of those\nsubmissive skills that people don't think about enough, because for some reason we're\nalways too busy teaching dominant skills.\n\nI kissed Mica again, and tore into his back.\n\nHe was ready for it. His breathing fast became irregular; he gasped; he shook in my\nhands. After a while, I pulled back and simply observed the intensity flooding through\nhim. His body undulated like a wave.\n\n\"I knew you were dangerous,\" he breathed. \"In exactly the way that I want.\"\n\n\"Dangerous,\" I repeated. I hesitated. \"What do you mean?” His eyelashes flickered, and I\nsaw that he was too far under to answer me. He probably barely knew what he was\nsaying. (In S&M, we call this state of mind subspace.)\n\nI pushed him a little farther. I only used my nails, but you can do a lot with your nails. I\nsaid his name, over and over. He struggled, he fought his own body. I observed the\nstruggle and saw myself in it. \"I know,\" I told him.\n\nEventually Mica said, quite seriously, that he wanted to stop. I was certain that he could\ntake more. A lot more. I might have been able to convince him to continue, and had him\nthank me for it later. But he needs to know that I'll respect him when he says to stop.\nAlso, in a somewhat self-interested way, I don't want to set a precedent where his\nboundaries are entirely nonverbal; where his limits depend on my capacity to see through\nhim. Maybe someday, when we know each other really well. Right now, it would make it\ntoo easy to seriously harm him... and for him to hate me afterwards.\n\nSo I stopped.\n\n\"No one has ever touched me so deeply, so fast before,\" Mica said, later. And, later later:\n\"This changes everything.\" I lay still, kept my arms around him, listening. \"That was\ntotal catharsis,\" he said. \"I mean --\" a note of doubt crept into his voice. \"Do you actually\nlike doing that?”\n\n\"Yes,\" I said. I said it fast and hard, because he needs to believe it. I understood why he\nwas asking: I've been there. When I was first getting into S&M, the first time I felt that\nway, I had a hard time believing that my partner actually liked doing that for me. It felt so\nincredible. It felt like I couldn't possibly be giving back as much as I received.\nSometimes, I still feel that insecurity.\n\n\"I'm glad you like it,\" Mica said. I felt his body relax next to mine. \"Because I'm going to\nwant that again.”\n\n\"I know,\" I said softly.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018675",
