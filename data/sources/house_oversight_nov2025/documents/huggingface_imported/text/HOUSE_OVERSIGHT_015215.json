  "text": "that, as the millennium comes to an end, tantric men will be popping up\neverywhere.\n\nA retired chairman and CEO of a title and escrow company, who\nattended another tantra party, tells me, “The difference between the\ntantra party and the party next door is the fact that at the beginning of the\nwedding tantra party there was a lot of ceremony and shared tantra ritual,\nbut once we had experienced that, it was every person for themselves. It\nwas like the party next door.” These were closed parties by invitation only.\nBut you didn’ t need an invitation for open parties. All you had to do was\nfind them.\n\nThe Wyndham Hotel is permeated by a sense of uninhibitedness. In\nthe elevator, a beautiful black woman is looking in the full-length mirror\nand admiring her new Clit Clip—non-piercing, adjustable, genital jewelry--\n\n“not designed to be painful,” | learned at the Adult Marketplace, “just\nvery sensual and aesthetically attractive. The Clit Clip is a long narrow, U-\nshaped piece of metal, designed to fit around the clitoris hood, with some\nlight-catching Austrian crystals, in your choice of clear, red, blue and\npurple, dangling from the ends.” The woman in the elevator turns toward\n\nme and says, “Isn’ tit nice?” Her husband smiles proudly.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015215",
