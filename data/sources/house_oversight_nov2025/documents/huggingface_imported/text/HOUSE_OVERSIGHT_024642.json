  "text": "ACKRELL\nCAPITAL Cannabis Investment Report | December 2017\n\nThe Path to Federal Legalization\n\nWe believe that the variable which will most impact the future size of the U.S. legal cannabis mar-\nket is the federal legalization process. How and when federal legalization occurs will impact other\nprimary drivers of the market, including the number of eligible consumers, penetration rates and\nconsumer spending. We predict six developments relating to federal legalization: (1) the U.S. Food\nand Drug Administration (FDA) will begin approving individual pharmaceutical-grade drugs derived\nfrom cannabis; (2) more states will adopt medical cannabis laws; (3) more states will adopt recre-\national laws; (4) the FDA will adopt routine approval procedures for drugs with extracts of low-THC/\nhigh-CBD cannabis varieties; (5) the FDA will adopt routine approval procedures for drugs with\nextracts of high-THC cannabis varieties; and (6) cannabis parts and derivatives will be removed from\nthe CSA schedules (either incrementally, starting with CBD, or all at once) and will be fully legal\nfor medical and recreational purposes. (We expand on these predicted developments in Chapter IV,\nU.S. Legal Landscape.)\n\nWe do not predict that these developments necessarily will occur in the order presented. We do\nexpect some of them to develop in parallel, and none of them depends fundamentally on any other.\nFor example, Congress could cause development (6) at any time by passing legislation that removes\ncannabis from the CSA schedules and establishes\n\nPath to Federal Legalization a national framework for recreational and medical\n\n.

As discussed on page 175, readers are cautioned to not\nplace undue reliance on our predictions or estimates. Almost certainly, our predictions and estimates\nwill prove inaccurate in some respects.\n\n6 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024642",
