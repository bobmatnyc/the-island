Piketty is right about\n\nthe data, but wrong about its interpretation.\n\nDepreciation Theory\n\nThis is the explanation I promised when | said that depreciation is essentially like\namortization. Accounting tends to practice straight-line depreciation over standard\ndepreciation periods. A well-known refinement, allowed but not much practiced in\nbusiness, is called current cost accounting. The idea is to correct distortions due to\npast inflation. The problem is that books reflect long-term assets and their\ndepreciation at original cost at date of booking. Current cost accounting adjusts both\nto the equivalent in current dollars. It shows both net worth and depreciation as\nhigher if prices inflated since booking, or lower if prices deflated. That seems to\n\nmake sense.\n\nA further adjustment called replacement cost accounting does the same, but also\nreplaces linear depreciation with a curve believed more realistic. National accounts\nadopt this method. It is sound in principle. But they shape the curve in the wrong\ndirection. They rely on records of actual sales of plant to model depreciation as\n\nsteep initially and slower later. I suggest that this record is misleading.\n\nMy starting point is that value of any capital is discounted cash flow. To keep things\nsimple at first, suppose that cash flow in constant dollars is expected to hold steady\n\nfor fifty years before asset life ends. Also suppose a constant time discount rate.\n\nPresent value at the outset is fifty years of discounted cash flow. At the beginning of\nthe second year, it is 49 years present value of the same cash flow at the same\n\ndiscount rate. All that has been lost is present value of the 50 and most-discounted\nyear. At the start of the third year, capital has dropped again by present value of the\n\n49th and second-most discounted year. So it continues until the end as the discount\n\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 20\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010960",
