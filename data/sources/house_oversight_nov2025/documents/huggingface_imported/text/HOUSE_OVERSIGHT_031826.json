O. SCOTT\n“Inside Job,” a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime without\npunishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The betrayal\nof public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and damaging than\n\nthe adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than villain.\n\nThe gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous\nas it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject\nmatter make “Inside Job” feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has\nsummoned the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint\n\nand good humor makes his case all the more devastating.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031826",
