  "text": "3.6 Postscript: Formalizing Pattern 55\n\nUsing this definition of pattern, combined with the formal theory of intelligence given in\nChapter 7, one may formalize the various hypotheses made in the previous section, regarding\nthe emergence of different kinds of networks and structures as patterns in intelligent systems.\nHowever, it appears quite difficult to prove the formal versions of these hypotheses given current\nmathematical tools, which renders such formalizations of limited use.\n\nFinally, consider the case where the metric space M has a partial ordering < on it; we may\nthen define\n\nDefinition 3.1. R € M is a subpattern in X € M to the degree\n\ntren true(R < P)diX\ndus\n\nR\nK —\n* Jpem\n\nThis degree is called the subpattern intensity of P in X.\n\nRoughly speaking, the subpattern intensity measures the percentage of patterns in X that\ncontain R (where \"containment\" is judged by the partial ordering <). But the percentage is\nmeasured using a weighted average, where each pattern is weighted by its intensity as a pattern\nin X. A subpattern may or may not be a pattern on its own. A nonpattern that happens to\noccur within many patterns may be an intense subpattern.\n\nWhether the subpatterns in X are to be considered part of the \"mind\" of X is a somewhat\nsuperfluous question of semantics. Here we choose to extend the definition of mind given in\n[Goe06a] to include subpatterns as well as patterns, because this makes it simpler to describe\nthe relationship between hypersets and minds, as we will do in Appendix ??.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012971",
