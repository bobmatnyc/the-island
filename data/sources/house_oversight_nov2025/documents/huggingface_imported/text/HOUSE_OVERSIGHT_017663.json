Rev. 861, *900\n\nThe Advisory Committee did not propose any change to Rule 15. 7!¢\nDiscussion:\n\nRule 15 authorizes depositions for the purpose of preserving evidence for trial, 7!’ thus, such depositions are an extension of\n\n218\n\nthe trial. Victims, accordingly, have the right to attend such proceedings, if they are public, under the same conditions\n\ngoverning their attendance at trial. To avoid any confusion over this issue, the proposed rule change directly states that fact.\n\nThe Advisory Committee declined to adopt this recommendation, concluding that depositions \"do not fall within the CVRA,\nwhich refers only to the victim's right not to be excluded from \"public court proceedings.” 7! But here, again, the Committee\nhas taken too narrow a view of the CVRA. It is simply unfair to victims to exclude them from a deposition in a criminal case -\nand, thus, a violation of the CVRA's command that victims be treated with fairness.\n\nThe simplest proof of this conclusion is to consider the rights of criminal defendants at depositions. Rule 15 directly guarantees\ncriminal defendants a right to attend a deposition. 77° Originally the rule was silent on a defendant's presence, but in the 1975\n\n221 4 defendant was guaranteed the right to attend. °°? Presumably, a major reason the Advisory\n\nenactment of the rule,\nCommittee added this language [*901] was to ensure fairness to defendants. 77+ Indeed, after an indictment, \"Rule 15\ndepositions might constitute a \"critical stage’ in a prosecution - requiring the presence of counsel - because of the potential\nconsequences of such depositions at trial.\" 274 Just as the Advisory Committee acted in 1975 to ensure defendants were treated\n\nfairly at criminal depositions, it should now do the same for victims.\n\nVictims also deserve the right to attend pretrial depositions because they are now participants in the criminal justice process. As\nthe Fifth Circuit explained in reversing a trial court which had allowed an ex parte deposition, \"depositions are never ordered\nwhere one party to the suit can be present, ask the questions, and hear the answers, and the opposing party in the case is not\nonly prevented from being present and asking questions, but is also denied even the opportunity to know what the questions\nand answers are.\" 72° The Fifth Circuit further noted that \"such a procedure is not only wholly unauthorized, it is contrary to\nthe most basic presuppositions of our adversary system of litigation.\" 72° Because a crime victim is now \"an independent\n\ni)\n\n© Proposed Amendments, supra note 71.\n\n217 See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d 419, 437 (10th Cir. 1994).\n\n218 Cf. United States v. L.M., 425 F. Supp. 2d 948, 957 (N.D. Iowa 2006) (finding juvenile proceedings to be covered by the CVRA only\ninsofar as they are public court proceedings).\n\n219 CVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 17 (emphasis in original) (quoting /8 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(3)(2006)).\n\n220 Bed. R. Crim. P. 15(d)(1)-(2).\n\n~I The Advisory Committee recommended various changes to the rule in 1974, which Congress modified somewhat in 1975. See Wright,\nsupra note 210, § 241, at 7-8. The changes discussed in this Article were initiated by the Advisory Committee.\n\n222 Wright, supra note 210, § 244, at 37.\n\n23 Part of the rationale may have also been to facilitate admission of the deposition testimony at trial, as a defendant has a right to confront\nadverse witnesses at trial. But the Confrontation Clause does not always guarantee defendants a right to attend a deposition, see, for example,\nUnited States v. Salim, 855 F.2d 944, 955 (2d Cir. 1988), so the defendant's right to attend the deposition must rest on a broader justification\nthan implementing constitutional requirements.\n\n224 United States v. Haves, 231 F.3d 663, 674 (9th Cir. 2000).\n\n25 In re United States, 878 F.2d 153, 157 (5th Cir. 1989) (emphasis in original).\n226 Iq.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017663",
