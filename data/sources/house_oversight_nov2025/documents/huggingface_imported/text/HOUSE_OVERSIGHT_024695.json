  "text": "A\n\nCKR L\nCAPI L\n\nEL\nTA\n\nDigital Media Opportunities\n\nWe believe opportunities in this segment include:\n\nPremium Content. We believe that opportunities exist to establish industry-specific publications\nand media platforms for both the business-to-business and business-to-consumer markets that are\nviewed as the legitimate voices of the industry.\n\nMobile Applications. E-commerce and digital media applications are well positioned for mobile\ndeployment within the cannabis industry. We expect a proliferation of mobile applications, even in the\nearly stages of the industry.\n\nEnabling Technology. Continued development of core and shared technology platforms remains\nan opportunity for digital media companies seeking to provide a better user experience. Technologies\nthat provide targeted experiences should enable digital media companies to realize greater returns on\ninvestments.\n\nDigital Media Challenges\n\nChallenges in this segment include:\n\nLimited Number of Advertisers. Broad, general-market advertisers are not commonly participating\nin the cannabis industry due to concerns about legal compliance and mass-market perception. As a\nresult, companies are currently competing for limited advertising revenue targeted at the cannabis-user\ndemographic.\n\nVenues. Established digital media companies—such as Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yelp—limit\nthe activities of cannabis-focused media companies on their sites in accordance with company policies.\nThis creates opportunities for niche publishers in the near term, but we believe that, ultimately, large\nmedia companies will view cannabis as a mainstream industry.\n\nDigital Media Outlook\n\nThe opportunity for cannabis-oriented digital media is substantial. We believe that companies with\nwell-executed strategies will emerge as the recognized voices of the industry and will be relied on by\nconsumers for a wealth of information from product recommendations to industry news. As regulatory\nconstraints relax, we expect the currently disparate and fragmented digital media services segment to\nconsolidate into integrated publishing, mobile and e-commerce offerings. However, as stated previ-\nously, we believe that digital media companies focused solely on the cannabis industry will eventually\nface considerable competition from—but may be logical acquisition targets for—traditional media\ncompanies.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 59\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024695",
