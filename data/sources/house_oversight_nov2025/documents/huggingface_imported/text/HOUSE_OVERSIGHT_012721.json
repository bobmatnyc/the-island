  "text": "Case 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 85-1\nCONGRESSIONAL RECORD — SENATE\n\nJune 8, 2011\n\nlegislative history because the CVRA ‘is un-\nambiguous.’’ Response of the United States,\nIn re Antrobus, No. 08-4002, at 12 n.7 (10th Cir.\nFeb. 12, 2008).\n\nAt the time that the Justice Department\nfiled this brief, no Court of Appeals agreed\nwith the Tenth Circuit. At the time, three\nother Circuits had all issued unanimous rul-\nings that crime victims were entitled to reg-\nular appellate review. See In re W.R. Huff\nAsset Mgmt. Co., 409 F.3d 555, 562 (2d Cir. 2005);\nKenna v. US. Dist. Ct. for the Cent. Dist. of Ca.,\n435 F.3d 1011, 1017 (9th Cir. 2006); In re Walsh,\n229 Fed.Appx. 58, at 60 (8rd Cir. 2007).\n\nMy next question for you is, given that the\nJustice Department has an obligation to use\nits ‘‘best efforts,’’ 18 U.S.C. §38771(c)(1), to af-\nford crime victims their rights, how could\nthe Department argue in Antrobus (and later\ncases) that the CVRA ‘‘unambiguously”’ de-\nnied crime victims regular appellate protec-\ntions of their rights when three circuits had\nreached the opposite conclusion?\n\nGOVERNMENT'S RIGHT TO ASSERT ERROR\nDENIAL OF VICTIMS’ RIGHTS\n\nTo further bolster protection of crime vic-\ntims’ rights, Congress also included an addi-\ntional provision in the CVRA—$§3771(d)(4)—\nallowing the Justice Department to obtain\nreview of crime victims’ rights issues in ap-\npeals filed by defendants: ‘‘In any appeal in\na criminal case, the Government may assert\nas error the district court’s denial of any\ncrime victim’s right in the proceeding to\nwhich the appeal relates.’ 18 U.S.C.\n§3771(d)(4). The intent underlying this provi-\nsion was to supplement the crime victims’\nappeal provision found in §3771(d)(3) by per-\nmitting the Department to also help develop\na body of case law expanding crime victims’\nrights in the many defense appeals that are\nfiled. It was not intended to in any way nar-\nrow crime victims’ rights to seek relief\nunder §3771(d)(3). Nor was it intended to bar\ncrime victims from asserting other remedies.\nFor instance, it was not intended to block\ncrime victims from taking an ordinary ap-\npeal from an adverse decision affecting their\nrights (such as a decision denying restitu-\ntion) under 28 U.S.C. §1291. Crime victims\nhad been allowed to take such appeals in var-\nious circuits even before the passage of the\nCVRA. See, e.g., United States v. Kones, 77\nF.3d 66 (8rd Cir. 1996) (crime victim allowed\nto appeal restitution ruling); United States v.\nPerry, 360 F.8d 519 (6th Cir. 2004) (crime vic-\ntims allowed to appeal restitution lien\nissue); Doe v. United States, 666 F.2d 43, 46 (4th\nCir. 1981) (crime victim allowed to appeal\nrape shield ruling).\n\nAs I explained at the time the CVRA was\nunder consideration, this provision supple-\nmented those pre-existing decisions by\n“allow[ing] the Government to assert a vic-\ntim’s right on appeal even when it is the de-\nfendant who seeks appeal of his or her con-\nviction. This ensures that victims’ rights are\nprotected throughout the criminal justice\nprocess and that they do not fall by the way-\nside during what can often be an extended\nappeal that the victim is not a party to.’’ 150\nConc. REC. $4270 (Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of\nSen. Kyl).\n\nI have heard from crime victims’ advocates\nthat the Department has not been actively\nenforcing this provision. Indeed, these advo-\ncates tell me that they are unaware of even\na single case where the Department has used\nthis supplemental remedy. My final ques-\ntion: Is it true that the Department has\nnever used this provision in even a single\ncase in the more than six years since the\nCVRA was enacted?\n\nSincerely,\nJON KYL,\nU.S. Senator.\n\nHONORING OUR ARMED FORCES\n\nSERGEANT VORASACK T. XKAYSANA\n\nMr. BENNET. Mr. President, it is\nwith a heavy heart that I rise today to\nhonor the life and heroic service of\nSGT Vorasack T. Xaysana. Sergeant\nXaysana, assigned to the Headquarters\nand Headquarters Company, 2nd Bat-\ntalion, based in Fort Hood, TX, died on\nApril 10, 2011. Sergeant Xaysana was\nserving in support of Operation New\nDawn in Kirkuk, Iraq. He was 30 years\nold.\n\nA native of Westminster, CO, Ser-\ngeant Xaysana enlisted in the Army in\n2005. During over 6 years of service, he\ndistinguished himself through his cour-\nage and dedication to duty. Sergeant\nXaysana’s exemplary service quickly\nwon the recognition of his commanding\nofficers. He earned, among other deco-\nrations, the Iraq Campaign Medal, the\nGlobal War on Terrorism Service\nMedal, and the Army Good Conduct\nMedal.\n\nSergeant Xaysana worked on the\nfront lines of battle, serving in the\nmost dangerous areas of Iraq. Mark\nTwain once said, ‘‘The fear of death fol-\nlows from the fear of life. A man who\nlives fully is prepared to die at any\ntime.” Sergeant Xaysana’s service was\nin keeping with this sentiment—by\nselflessly putting country first, he\nlived life to the fullest. He lived with a\nsense of the highest honorable purpose.\n\nAt substantial personal risk, he\nbraved the chaos of combat zones\nthroughout Iraq. Though his fate on\nthe battlefield was uncertain, he\npushed forward, protecting America’s\ncitizens, her safety, and the freedoms\nwe hold dear. For his service and the\nlives he touched, Sergeant Xaysana\nwill forever be remembered as one of\nour country’s bravest.\n\nTo Sergeant Xaysana’s parents,\nThong Chanh and Manithip, and to his\nentire family, I cannot imagine the\nsorrow you must be feeling. I hope\nthat, in time, the pain of your loss will\nbe eased by your pride in Vorasack’s\nservice and by your knowledge that his\ncountry will never forget him. We are\nhumbled by his service and his sac-\nrifice.\n\nEST\n\nGRAZING IMPROVEMENT ACT\n\nMr. BARRASSO. Mr. President, I rise\ntoday to submit for the REcoRD an ar-\nticle written by Karen Budd-Falen and\npublished May 28, 2011, in the Wyoming\nLivestock Journal. The article’s title is\n“Leveling the Playing Field: Support\nfor the Grazing Improvement Act of\n2011.”’\n\nThe title of the article is instructive.\nAnyone living and working in rural\ncommunities knows the playing field is\nnot level. The National Environmental\nPolicy Act has become the preferred\ntool to delay and litigate grazing per-\nmit renewals for American ranchers.\n\nLivestock grazing on public lands has\na strong tradition in Wyoming and all\nWestern States. Ranchers are proud\n\nEntered on FLSD Docket 06/17/2011 Page 4 of 4\n\nS3609\n\nstewards of the land, yet the permit-\nting process to renew their permits is\nseverely backlogged due to litigation\naimed at eliminating livestock from\npublic land.\n\nDuring times of high unemployment\nand increasing food prices, we need to\nbe encouraging jobs in rural economies.\nWe need to be fostering an environ-\nment to raise more high quality, safe,\nAmerican beef and lamb; not litigating\nless.\n\nThat is why I introduced the Grazing\nImprovement Act of 2011. This legisla-\ntion will provide the certainty and sta-\nbility public grazing permit holders\ndesperately need in order to continue\nsupporting rural jobs, providing\nhealthy food, and maintaining open\nspaces for recreation and wildlife.\n\nIt is time to help level the playing\nfield for hard working ranching fami-\nlies across the West. Their livelihood\nshould not be held hostage by litiga-\ntion and anti-grazing special interest\ngroups. I thank my colleagues, Sen-\nators ENZI, CRAPO, HATCH, HELLER,\nRIScH, and THUNE, in supporting ranch-\ning families and this legislation.\n\nMr. President, I ask unanimous con-\nsent to have printed in the REcorpD the\narticle to which I referred.\n\nThere being no objection, the mate-\nrial was ordered to be printed in the\nRECORD, as follows:\n\n[From the Wyoming Livestock Roundup,\n\nMay 28, 2011)\n\nLEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD: SUPPORT FOR\nTHE GRAZING IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2011\n(By Karen Budd-Falen)\n\nIf jobs and the economy are the number\none concern for America, why are rural com-\nmunities and ranchers under attack by rad-\nical environmental groups and overzealous\nfederal regulators?\n\nAmerica depends upon the hundreds of\nproducts that livestock provide, yet radical\ngroups and oppressive regulations make it\nalmost impossible for ranchers to stay in\nbusiness. Opposition to these jobs comes in\nthe form of litigation by radical environ-\nmental groups to eliminate grazing on public\nlands, radical environmental group pressure\nto force “voluntary” grazing permit buy-\nouts from “willing sellers,’’ and holding per-\nmittees hostage to the court deference given\nto regulatory ‘‘experts.” The playing field is\nnot level and the rancher is on the losing\nside. The Grazing Improvement Act of 2011\nwill level the playing field. I urge your sup-\nport.\n\nThe Grazing Improvement Act of 2011 does\nthe following:\n\n1. Term of Grazing Leases and Permits.\nBoth BLM and Forest Service term grazing\npermits are for a 10-year term. This bill ex-\ntends that term to 20 years. This extension\ndoes not affect either the BLM’s or Forest\nService’s ability to make interim manage-\nment decisions based upon resource or other\nneeds, nor does it impact the preference\nright of renewal for term grazing permits or\nleases.\n\n2. Renewal, Transfer and Reissuance of\nGrazing Leases and Permits. This section\ncodifies the various ‘‘appropriation riders”\nfor the BLM and Forest Service requiring\nthat permits being reissued, renewed or\ntransferred continue to follow the existing\nterms and conditions until the paperwork is\ncomplete. Thus, the rancher is not held hos-\ntage to the ability of the agency to get its\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012721",
