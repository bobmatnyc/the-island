  "text": "agent and Jean Pigozzi as an international banker.\n\nLunch is called at 4 p.m. and Michael Douglas takes seven heavily made-up and bejeweled women including Susan, Jill and me\nto a restaurant around the corner. Gordon Gekko hosts a hen party talking about children, schools, country houses and vacations.\n\nBack on the set Oliver is shooting the actual dinner. Assistant directors ask for volunteers to dance to the live music. Prince\nDimitri twirls and dips Jackie Weld. Kelly Klein, in her own Karl Lagerfeld sheer black organza, watches from a table with scattered\nchampagne glasses half-filled with apple juice along with her 86-year-old father, Tulley Rector. Charlie Sheen leaves for LA and\nShia is very annoyed he was not introduced to his hero. Carrie Mulligan, costumed like Audrey Hepburn, chats with us between\ntakes.\n\nThe final set up is a long tracking shot of Josh Brolin and his wife as they triumphantly enter the ball. It is close to 9 p.m. and\nLord William Astor arrives to pick me up for Amalia Dayan and Adam Lindemann's dinner for artists uptown.\n\nOliver is introduced to William and delights in calling him Lord as he immediately moves him into the top of the shot and\ninstructs him to tell Eli Wallach, \"We must do lunch\". Ever the proper English gentleman, William advises Oliver that Lords do not\nuse American slang and improvises his own lines. The tracking shot continues for numerous takes following Josh and Noelle as\nevery VIP extra gets another shot at instant stardom with one-line greetings.\n\nAt last, “It’s a wrap” is screamed after 10 p.m. Prince Dimitri tells The Wall Street Journal it was, \"a day of electrifying\nglamour,\" and “the longest gala of my life. I was in black tie for thirteen hours.\"\n\nNovember 25, Tommy Gun Salon, Ludlow Street, last day of shooting\n\nDonald Trump is on set at 7 a.m. ready for his close up. He is trying to make a mid-day departure on his jet from Teterboro\nwith wife Melania and son Baron for Thanksgiving weekend in Palm Beach. Back in September, Oliver had invited Donald Trump to\ndinner at \"21\" to meet his leading men Josh and Shia so they could observe New York's most charismatic powerbroker in his natural\nenvironment.\n\nThe scene is London so the grey skies are perfect. Gekko has moved abroad to make his financial comeback. The scene opens\non the back of his head in a barber's chair as he watches the financial news on TV. The camera pulls back and Gordon Gekko is\nfinally revealed as the powerful bull he once was in an exquisite suit and signature slicked-back hair. Donald Trump walks into the\nshop for a cut and the banter begins about the money market. From his chair, Donald leans into Michael and suggests a \"comb over\"\nlike his famous do. Gekko, with a slight grin, says, \"No thanks Donald, I am a gel man.\"\n\nThe crew is yucking it up and Donald feels great. Paparazzi shoot the whole scene with long lenses from across the street. The\nunit publicist is helpless to keep this under wraps. Donald emerges, poses and gives interviews. Michael comes out, and the press\nthink they have a scoop on the ending. Gekko is back in all his lovable titan splendor. Full-page photos of Michael and Donald run\nthe next day in the tabloids. Never underestimate Oliver Stone’s surprise endings.\n\nTwentieth Century Fox releases \"Wall Street 2: The Money Never Sleeps\" on April 23rd and it's got hit written all over it.\n\nBis Bis Bhs fs bls fs fs 2s 2s 24s 2s 2s fs fe 2s Bis fe 2 is fe 2 fs Bhs 2s oft ahs aft 2s 2s OIE fe 2fs OIE fe 2 Bis fe 2s is ahs fe fs ahs ahs 2s 2fe ahs 2s 2s fs fe 2k 2fs fe fe 2fs 2s 2 afk\nThe information contained in this communication is\n\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\n\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\n\nthe use of the addressee.
