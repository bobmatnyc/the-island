Importance: — High

Not sure if realistic but trump may impact 5g and not sure if net positive or negative for this potential
investment.

Hi Jeff,

I realize the last term sheet was a draft, my fault (my computer syne’d the draft with the same name).

Here is a correct version, the last page is the signature page. It would be great if I could get this back
tomorrow. Nothing is due until the recap is complete, hopefully in about 4 weeks. I am planning to start those
discussions the end of next week.

Things are going well. The more I learn the more excited I get. I will be at Tarana tomorrow
discussing a window mount version to try to get to self-install. 1gbps in a self-install package would be the last
step.

We will only need a tower ever 4-5km in the city, which is basically 2 or 3 rooftops for all of Boston.
I met with American Tower today (I know their CEO and CTO) and they have plenty of room on the John
Hancock.

Fun Stuff and great to be doing something together!
