Apologies.\n\nA word of explanation about the past two weeks:\n= Financing:\nAm in the midst of a $8-10 mn financing\nIn past two weeks have met potential investors in Toronto, Vancouver, DC, NYC, and Boston.\nHave in this time already closed approximately $2 mn, which is encouraging\nThis pace will continue for another month or so until the financing is fully closed.\n= US DoD:\n\nLast week several of us took our prototype device to be demonstrated for the US military’s Walter Reed Army Institute of\nResearch (WRAIR).\n\nAt the conclusion of a four-hour session our host, Colonel Colin Ohrt, MD, who is in charge of the relevant WRAIR program,\ncalled our device a game-changer. He would like to pilot our device in Tanzania, Cambodia, Kenya, and Thailand. Follow up is\nbeing arranged.\n\nColonel Ohrt also separately evaluated our white paper on malaria elimination and expressed strong interest in also pursuing this\nproject with Fio.\n\nAccompanying Fio for these meetings was General Richard Tubb, MD (retired last year from the US Air Force). Dick was Chief\nof the White House Medical Unit and physician to Presidents Clinton and Bush.\n\n=» USAID\n\nAlso last week we successfully demonstrated our device for USAID and the President’s Malaria Initiative (PMI). Follow up is\nbeing arranged.\n\nAccompanying Fio for these meetings was Andrew Natsios, former head of USAID.\nFor all the foregoing meetings our prototype device performed well. Exciting times.\n\nMy trip to London has yet to be arranged and is dependent on financing events. In the meantime, I will happily travel to meet you\nin NYC.\n\nAttached is the White Paper on Malaria Elimination which Fio had written and invited several academic partners to join. Since the\ntime the document was first drafted, we discovered an even simpler technical strategy based on our new prototype device and\nreinforced by our recent discussion with WRAIR. This simplification would result in field trials as early as next year, which is\nmuch sooner than in the attached White Paper. To accomplish this we would team up with WRAIR rather than some of the current\nacademic partners in the paper.\n\nBest regards and wishes,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029914",
