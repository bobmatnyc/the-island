  "text": "The personal interactions we had with Palestinians in the weeks after the war\nwere without obvious tension, much less hostility. They were often friendly.\nLooking back, I’m sure that was one reason — along with simple human nature,\na desire to enjoy Israel’s new sense of both security and size — that none of us\nwas inclined to look too deeply, or too far ahead, and contemplate the\nimplications for our country’s future. I was aware, of course, that the politeness\nwe exchanged with the Palestinians of Jerusalem or the West Bank were\nsuperficial: a few words across a market stall or a restaurant counter. I did not\npretend to myself that our Arab neighbors were now suddenly inclined to be our\nfriends.\n\nBut I did feel that, having come face-to-face with our overwhelming military\nsupremacy, the Arab states would, over time, grant Israel simple acceptance.\nFrom there, I believed that we could begin the process of building genuine,\nlasting, human relationships and, eventually, peace.\n\nThere was a brief period after the war when Eshkol cautioned his ministers\nabout the implications of holding on to the vast new area we had conquered.\nThe government formally agreed to treat most of it, with the exception of\nJerusalem, as a “deposit” to be traded for the opening of peace talks. Yet within\nweeks, the emphasis in the Israeli political debate shifted to which parts we\nwould keep: the Sinai and the Golan almost certainly, as well as the Jordan\nValley and a number of areas of past Jewish settlement on the West Bank. The\ndrift away from any serious talk of trading land for peace was accelerated by the\nArab states’ response to the war. Perhaps that, too, was simply a matter of\nhuman nature, a reluctance on their part to accept defeat. But they appeared no\nmore ready than before to contemplate peace. Throughout the summer, there\nwere clashes along our new “border” with Egypt: the Suez Canal. In September,\nall the Arab states adopted a platform which became known as the “three no’s”.\nThey rejected not just the idea of peace, but peace talks, or recognition of the\nState of Israel. And in October, Egyptian missile boats attacked and sunk Israel’s\nlargest warship, the destroyer Eilat, killing nearly 50 people on board.\n\nWithout this renewed violence, perhaps, we in Israel might have been able to\nconsider more deeply the future implications of our victory in the Six-Day War.\nThe gains on the battlefield, of course, were clear to everyone. We were no\nlonger a small, constricted country beset by a sense of vulnerability. We were\nnot only much bigger, but also stronger than the combined armies of the Arab\nstates. Still, very few people asked themselves at the time what kind of Israel\nthis implied. We failed to grasp the potential complications in holding on to all\n\n96\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011567",
