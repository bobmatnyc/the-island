It depends on the life one has lived.\n\nI have been fortunate to live an ever changing life, both personally and professionally, and\nalthough my views on particular issues have been modified over time, my basic commitment to\nliberal values has remained relatively constant, in part because of my strong upbringing and in part\nbecause my career has been based on advocating these values.\n\nAn ancient Chinese curse goes this way: “May you live in interesting times.” One of the worst\nthings a doctor can say after examining you is: “Hmm... that’s interesting.” I have been blessed\nwith living an interesting, if often controversial, life.\n\nAs an adolescent, I was involved in causes such as justice for the Rosenbergs, abolition of the\ndeath penalty, and the end of McCarthyism.\n\nAs a law clerk, during one of the most dramatic periods of our judicial history, I worked on\nimportant civil rights and liberties cases, heard the “I have a dream” speech of Martin Luther\nKing, was close to the Cuban Missile Crisis, and partook of events following the assassination of\nJohn F. Kennedy.\n\nAs a young lawyer, I played a role in the Pentagon Papers case, the forced resignation of Richard\nNixon, and the anti-war prosecutions of Dr. Spock, the Chicago Seven, the Weather\nUnderground and Patricia Hearst. I consulted on the Chappaquiddick investigation of Ted\nKennedy, on the attempted deportation of John Lennon and the draft case against Mohammad\nAli. I was an observer at the trial of accused Nazi war criminal John Demjanjuk and subsequently\nconsulted with the Israeli government about that case.\n\nLater in my career, I was a lawyer in the Bill Clinton impeachment, the Bush v. Gore election\ncase, the efforts to free Nelson Mandela, Natan Sharansky and other political prisoners. I\nparticipated in the Senate censure of California Senator Alan Cranston, the Frank Snepp CIA\ncensorship case, prosecutions involving the former Yugoslavia in the Hague, the defense of Israel\nagainst international war crime prosecution, and the investigation of Wiki-Leaks and Julian\nAssange. I worked on the appeals of the Jewish Defense League murder case and the Jonathan\nPollard spy prosecution. I consulted on the defense of director John Landis, the OJ Simpson\ndouble murder case and the Bakke “affirmative action” litigation. I challenged the Bruce Franklin\ntenure denial at Stanford and appealed the Claus Von Bulow attempted murder conviction, the\nLeona Helmsley tax case, the Mike Tyson rape prosecution, the conviction of Conrad Black, the\nTison Brothers murder case, the “I Am Curious Yellow” censorship prosecution, the Deep Throat\ncase, the nude beach case on Cape Cod and the HAIR censorship case. I participated in the\nWoody Allen-Mia Farrow litigation, the Michael Milken case, the litigation against the cigarette\nindustry and the wrongful death suit on behalf of Steven J. Gould. I have won more than 100\ncases and have been called—perhaps also with a bit of hyperbole—“the winningest appellate\ncriminal defense lawyer in history.” Of the more than three dozen murder and attempted murder\ncases in which I have participated, I lost fewer than a handful. None of my capital punishment\nclients has been executed.\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017097",
