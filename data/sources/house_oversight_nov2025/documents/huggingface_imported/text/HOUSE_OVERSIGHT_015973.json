  "text": "Hyper-Computing 283\n\nreasons. First, most people see no need for super-Turing thought. They\nbelieve computers are sufficient. Second, they believe the brain is not a\nhospitable place for quantum effects: it is too hot and too chaotic. Indeed,\nuntil recently people assumed quantum effects would have no place in\nbiological entities, but this orthodoxy has recently been overthrown by\nthe discovery of quantum processes in photosynthesis. The paper by\nTravis Craddock of Nova and others suggests there may also be quantum\nstructures in the neurons of our brains and we might possess quantum\ncomputers after all. But, remember, Penrose and Hameroff don't only\nneed quantum coherence within our brain to explain consciousness.\nThey also need gravitational effects.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015973",
