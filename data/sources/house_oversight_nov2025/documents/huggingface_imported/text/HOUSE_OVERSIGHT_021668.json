Brune! has been observed as a house guest at\nEpstein’s Palm Beach home and may well have had contact with him also in New York, where Epstein owns a lavish\nhome—the city’s largest private residence—and in Paris, where Epstein keeps an apartment on elegant Ave. Foch.\n\nCBS reporter Craig Pyes, who investigated MC2 for a 60 Minutes broadcast several years ago, is quoted in Michael\nGross’ book about the modeling industry, Bad and Beautiful. Pyes told the author that Brunei “ranks among the\nsleaziest people in the fashion industry. We're talking about a conveyor belt, not a casting couch. Hundreds of girls\nwere not only harassed but molested.” Now The Daily Beast has learned that Epstein had made a $1 million wire\ntransfer to Brunel's offshore bank account in September 2004, just as he was setting up MC2. Whether this was a gift\nor a loan or a backdoor investment in the new venture is unknown. A French citizen who managed to avoid giving\nevidence in the Epstein investigation, Brunel declined to comment on any of this, as does Fuller. Asked in April of\nBrunel's activities, Epstein said “I’m 100 percent convinced that he doesn’t traffic children.” (Brunel has never been\ncharged.)\n\nAn American fashion designer who booked her girls through MC2 says they were very young and very beautiful; many\nwere from Eastern Europe and spoke little English. A former bookkeeper in the agency’s Miami office, who also\narranged visas for girls traveling to the U.S., confirmed that MC2 girls became frequent guests on Epstein’s private\njets.\n\nPilot logs obtained in the civil suits show that some of the named plaintiffs were on the flight manifests. Other times,\nthe pilot would just list the other passengers plus \"female.”\n\nRead Conchita Sarnoff's original report on Epstein.\n\nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced\nthree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report. She is a contributor to The Huffington Post and is writing a book about child trafficking in\nAmerica.\n\nGet a head start with the Morning Scoop email.
