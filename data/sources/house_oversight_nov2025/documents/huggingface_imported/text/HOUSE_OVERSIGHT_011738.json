  "text": "precedent of doing nothing would, in my view, be very serious. I recommended\nthat he approve the operation, and Rabin agreed.\n\nI attended the final briefing shortly afterwards. I was impressed by the\ndetermined faces of the men in the two sayeret teams. One of the officers was\n23-year-old Nir Poraz, whom I remembered from operational briefings in the\nkirya on previous sayeret missions. Wachsman was being held in a room on the\nfirst floor. The commandos would simultaneously detonate explosives on three\ndoors: at the front, on the side, and a third one leading through a kitchen to the\nroom where the kidnappers had their hostage. The attack began fifteen minutes\nbefore the Hamas deadline. The explosive charges went off, but only the one in\nthe front blew open the door. Poraz and his team rushed in, but one of the\nkidnappers opened fire, killing him and wounding six others. The other team\nhad by now made it to the first floor. But despite firing at the metal lock, they\nhad trouble getting the door to open. By the time they got in, Wachsman had\nbeen killed, shot in the neck and chest.\n\nI was in the command post a few hundred yards away. I called Rabin and\nthen went to see him in the kirya. The head of personnel for the army had gone\nto see the Wachsman family and break the news to them. Now, we had to tell\nthe country. Rabin and I appeared on television together. Rabin insisted —\nwrongly — on saying he bore full responsibility. What had gone wrong, I had\ntried to impress on him, was not the decision to attempt the rescue. It was the\nrescue itself. That was not his responsibility. It was mine.\n\nThe next day, I visited Wachsman’s parents, and tried to convey how painful\nthe failed rescue was to me, Rabin and every one else involved. I was inspired\nand humbled by their response. His father had told a reporter he wanted to\nconvey his condolences to the parents of Nir Poraz. “This added loss has shaken\nme terribly,” he said. He told me he also believed that the Prime Minister had\napproved the rescue using his best judgement on the information that he had\navailable. I spent time separately speaking to Mrs Wachsman. | tried to explain\nthat in fighting an enemy like Hamas, people who not just threaten to kill but\nhad proven they had no hesitation in doing so, I’d felt there was no choice but to\nattempt the rescue. I admitted we’d known the risks. But we’d tried to do the\nright thing, both for the country and her son. I think she understood, though I\nknew that nothing could alter the terrible sadness of her loss. The pain would\ntake years to heal. Some part of it never would. Still, I felt it was important she\nand her husband know that we, too, felt their loss. For years afterwards, Nava\nand I continued to visit them.\n\n267\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011738",
