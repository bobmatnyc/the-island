  "text": "832\n\nfrom Al Rajhi accounts. Jd. In “December\n1999, Al Rajhi directly funded Tulkarm\nCharity Committee, a known front for Ha-\nmas.” Jd. 971.\n\nMembers of the Al Rajhi family, which\nowns and controls Al Rajhi Bank, are al-\nleged to have ties to Osama bin Laden’s\npersonal secretary. /d. 179. The Al Ra-\njhi family is purportedly a major donor to\nthe SAAR Network, a Defendant here,\nbeing investigated by federal authorities in\nVirginia. Id. 1980-84. Finally, Al Rajhi\nfamily members are allegedly closely asso-\nciated with wealthy donors to Osama bin\nLaden. Jd. 185 (alleging ties with the\nGolden Chain).\n\nJudge Robertson found that the only\nallegation in the Third Amended Burnett\nComplaint that stated a claim upon which\nrelief could be granted was that Al Rajhi\nBank acted as an instrument “of terror, in\nraising, facilitating and transferring money\nto terrorist organizations.” Burnett [, 274\nF.Supp.2d at 109 (quoting Burnett Com-\nplaint 146). Judge Robertson noted that\nthere was no support “for the proposition\nthat a bank is liable for injuries done with\nmoney that passes through its hands in the\nform of deposits, withdrawals, check clear-\ning services, or any other routine banking\nservice.” Jd. In light of the liberal plead-\ning standards, however, Judge Robertson\ndenied Al Rajhi Bank’s motion to dismiss\nand permitted it to request a more defini-\ntive statement under Rule 12(e). Jd. at\n110. The Burnett Plaintiffs provided an\n89-paragraph response on August 27,\n2003. Thereafter, Al Rajhi Bank renewed\nits motion to dismiss pursuant to Rule\n\n12(b)(6).\n\n40. Under Islamic banking laws, Hararm is\nforbidden income that must be given away.\nThe disposal of Hararm cannot be considered\ncharitable giving. Rule 12(e) Statement 19.\nIn the 12(e) statement, the Burnett Plaintiffs\nexplain that al Qaeda takes advantage of the\nunder-regulated Islamic banking system to\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nAl Rajhi Bank argues that Plaintiffs of-\nfer no factual allegations in support of\ntheir conclusion that Al Rajhi Bank had to\nknow that the charities it supported\nthrough Zakat and Hararm“ payments\nwere really fronts for al Qaeda. Al Rajhi\nBank contends it had a legal and religious\nduty to make its charitable donations and\nany terrorist activity by the recipient char-\nities was unknown to Al Rajhi Bank. See\nRule 12(e) Statement 11 26, 29. Contrary\nto Plaintiffs’ arguments, Al Rajhi Bank\nsubmits it did not have a duty, or a right,\nto inspect the Defendant charities’ finan-\ncial transactions to ascertain the ultimate\ndestination of its donations. But see Rule\n12(e) Statement 132 (“Al Rajhi is required\nto determine that the ultimate recipients of\nthese contributions fall within one of the\ncategories prescribed in the Quran for re-\ncipients of Zakat.”). Al Rajhi Bank sub-\nmits that SAMA did not implement any\nduty to investigate Zakat payments after\nits meeting with representatives of the Na-\ntional Security Council and Office of For-\neign Assets Control.\n\n[95] Plaintiffs do not allege that Al\nRajhi Bank provided direct material sup-\nport to al Qaeda. Rather, Plaintiffs claim\nAl Rajhi Bank aided and abetted the Sep-\ntember 11 terrorists by donating to certain\nDefendant charities and acting as the bank\nfor these Defendants. New York law and\nthe courts interpreting the ATA in Boim\nmake very clear that concerted action lia-\nbility requires general knowledge of the\nprimary actor’s conduct. See Pittman, 149\nF.3d at 123; Boim IJ, 291 F.3d at 1023;\nBown ITT, 340 F.Supp.2d at 906. Even\n\nmove and launder money. 12(e) Statement\n{1 1. Plaintiffs allege that al Qaeda has pervert-\ned the Zakat and Hararm principles in Islam-\nic banking to collect and distribute money to\nindividuals and cells throughout the world.\nId. 494-9; see also Burnett Complaint 1 43.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017897",
