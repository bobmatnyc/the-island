  "text": "Johnnie Cochran Meets Dr. Hip\n\nTragedy and absurdity were two sides of the same coin: On one side,\n\nO.J. Simpson’ s_ “suicide” note with a smiley face in the O of his\nsignature; on the other side, the woman who pinched Simpson lawyer\nRobert Shapiro’ s ass because “I wanted to be part of history.” And\nsomewhere along the ridge of that coin was Simpson himself, walking into\nthe courtroom humming the melody of “Touch Me” from the Broadway\nhit Cats and explaining to reporters that he was thinking about his\nchildren.\n\nThat was at Simpson’ s criminal trial. Shortly before his civil trial\nbegan in 1997, | met his lead attorney, Johnnie Cochran. He was the guest\nof honor and luncheon speaker at a national convention of criminal\ndefense attorneys held in a huge banquet hall at a hotel in Santa Monica.\nNo media people were allowed entry.\n\nOne of the attendees was Dr. Eugene Schoenfeld, also known as Dr.\nHip from his days as a syndicated columnist for the underground press. He\nnow testifies occasionally as an expert witness, and was at this event for\n\nthat reason. My wife Nancy and | were his guests.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015189",
