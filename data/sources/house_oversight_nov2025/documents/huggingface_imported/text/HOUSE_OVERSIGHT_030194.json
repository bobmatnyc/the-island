  "text": "When everything was quiet, we went outside and stood at the edge\nof his unused swimming pool. Dead leaves floated in the water. Lenny\ncupped his hands to his mouth. “All right, you dogs,” he called out.\n\n“Bark for the rich man!” --thereby setting off a chain reaction of barking\ndogs, a canine chorus echoing through Hollywood Hills.\n\nWe ordered some pizza, and he played some old tapes, ranging\nfrom a faith healer to patriotic World War II songs. “Good-bye, Mama, I'm\noff to Yokohama, the Land of Yama-Yama...”\n\nBack at the Café Au Go Go arrest in New York, Lenny had told a\nfantasy tale about Eleanor Roosevelt, quoting her, “I've got the nicest tits\nthat have ever been in this White House...” The top of the police complaint\nwas “Eleanor Roosevelt and her display of tits.” At the trial, Lenny acted as\nhis own attorney. He had obtained the legislative history of an Albany\nstatute, and he discovered that back in 1931 there was an amendment\nproposed, which excluded from arrest in an indecent performance:\nStagehands, spectators, musicians, and--here was the fulcrum of his\ndefense--actors. The law had been misapplied to him. Despite opposition\nby the New York Society for the Suppression of Vice, the amendment was\n\nfinally signed into law by then-Governor Roosevelt, but to no avail.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030194",
