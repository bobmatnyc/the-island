  "text": "America’s nation-building exercise of the past twenty years was\nfounded on self-contradictions that have tarnished US foreign\ncredibility. The geopolitical framework for that policy has been\n“embrace and abandon,” a formula that has caused frustration,\nconfusion and concern to America’s allies in the region and displaced\nmany millions of young refugees.\n\nAs America rethinks its interests in the Middle East, its primary\nconcern is the elimination of domestic terrorism. The path forward\nreplaces fear with hope and poverty with prosperity. Once security in\nthe Middle East is attained, including a negotiated peace between the\nIsraelis and the Palestinians, the USA must respond with an “end-\nstate” perspective to draw a comprehensive solution similar to the\nMarshall Plan. Going from promoting then dumping dictators to\ndrawing a new manifesto for economic rebirth would mean that\nfinally, the America is finally doing right in teeming, oil-rich desert\nlands where it did wrong for decades.\n\nThomas J. Barrack Jr. is an international private equity investor and\nthe founder and executive chairman of Colony Capital. He is also\nforeign policy and economic advisor to GOP U.S. Presidential\ncandidate Donald Trump. The views expressed in this article are his\nown and do not reflect the campaign.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031723",
