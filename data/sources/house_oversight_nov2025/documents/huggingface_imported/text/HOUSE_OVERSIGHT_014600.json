First, oil prices are recovering,\nreversing the persistent drag they had exerted\nthroughout much of early 2016. Second, wages are\nfirming and fiscal policy is being eased, dampening\ndeflation worries. Finally, recession odds are\nfalling as the drag from oil weakness and dollar\nstrength fades.\n\nWith breakeven inflation rates still below long-\nterm consensus forecasts and the Federal Reserve’s\ntarget, we expect positive total returns from TIPS\nin 2017. Still, TIPS’ absolute returns are likely to\nbe modest, as their eight-year duration will make it\ndifficult for coupon income to meaningfully exceed\nprincipal losses as rates rise. Moreover, given TIPS’\nunfavorable tax treatment (discussed at length\nin our 2011 Outlook), we continue to advise US\nclients with taxable accounts to use municipal\nbonds for their strategic allocation.\n\nWe expect rates to continue to\nincrease, albeit at a slower pace in\n\n2017, as many of the forces that have\n\nrestrained yields are slowly fading.\n\nUS Municipal Bond Market\n\nMunicipal bond holders were not immune from\n2016’s about-face in US Treasury yields. Last\nOctober, municipal bonds were enjoying some of\ntheir best returns in years, only to be hit by losses\narising from both rising interest rates and budding\nconcerns about tax changes in the wake of the US\npresidential election. The abrupt redemptions of\nmunicipal bond mutual funds only exacerbated\nthese losses, with the pace of outflows second only\nto the mid-2013 taper tantrum (see Exhibit 81).\nAll told, municipal bonds suffered one of their\nworst years in recent history, with intermediate\nmunicipal bonds actually experiencing a rare loss\n(see Exhibit 82).\n\nUnfortunately, the near-term outlook remains\nchallenging. As Exhibit 81 reminds us, mutual\nfund flows tend to be sticky in this asset class,\nwith persistent periods of both buying and selling\ndepending on the trajectory of interest rates. Based\non historical episodes, there is scope for the current\nstring of outflows to extend further.\n\nMoreover, clarity on tax policy will\nremain elusive for months, during which\ntime headline risk will be significant.\nEven worse, a sizable reduction in the\ntop individual tax rate for municipal\nbonds—if ultimately passed—could\nsignificantly shift the economics of\nowning them, leading to further sales.\n\nThese fresh worries on tax policies\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 67\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014600",
