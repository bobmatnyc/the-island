He seems very interested in\nyour relationship with the news media. I told him you were a hell of a guy:) One oddity: he said he\nhad been told that that quote from Trump about you in the original NY Mag story had been\nmanufactured. ie, that I did not actually speak to Donald. Which is bull shit of course. Iam sure\nthat is what Trump told him as they have been getting a lot of questions from reporters about you.\n\nHe actually seemed to be a sensible guy/solid reporter -- just from the few conversations I had with\nhim. I think he is close to finishing up.\n\nDid you ever speak to him?\n\nhttp: //topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/landon jr thomas/inde\nx.html\n\nplease note\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032873",
