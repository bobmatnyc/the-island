The same could be said for the dramatic\ncuts in US drilling budgets, which have precipitated\nnotable declines in US shale output (see Exhibit\n94). Lower oil prices have also supported above-\naverage global demand growth, helping to absorb\nexcess inventories. Lastly, OPEC agreed to\n\nlower production in November 2016, while also\nsecuring a promise from its significant non-OPEC\ncounterparts to do the same. Taken together, these\ndevelopments support our forecast for moderately\nhigher oil prices in 2017.\n\nThis balancing act is still precarious, however.\nOil inventories stand well above seasonal averages,\nso failure to honor the announced production\ncuts could delay the recovery in oil prices or, even\nworse, cause renewed declines. The risk of poor\ncompliance is not trivial, given that producers\nhave exceeded their quota 90% of the time by an\naverage of 1 million barrels per day (mmbd) since\n2000 (see Exhibit 95). The pledges from Russia\nand certain smaller non-OPEC producers are\nparticularly suspect, as similar promises to cut their\n\nOil is finding its footing again after\nhaving stumbled dramatically over\nthe last two years.\n\nown output along with OPEC have been broken\nin the past.\n\nMoreover, while the announced cuts are\nsignificant—the OPEC agreement would reduce\nproduction by up to 1.2 mmbd, equivalent to\nabout one year of average global demand growth—\nthey are largely a reversal of production growth\nseen over the last six months (see Exhibit 96).\nMeanwhile, Libya and Nigeria were excluded from\nthese new OPEC quotas given sizable domestic\ndisruptions that have depressed their production.\nRecent signs of improvement, however, suggest a\nrebound in their production cannot be dismissed.\nTherefore, the announced cuts are not a panacea to\nthe current oil imbalance, particularly if US shale\noutput increases meaningfully in response.\n\nThis last point is important, as US shale\naccounted for 60% of global production growth\nbetween 2012 and 2015 despite representing\nless than 5% of the total output. Although US\nproduction is now declining, two factors may\narrest its slide in 2017. First, the breakeven price\nfor shale drilling has fallen to an average of $50\nper barrel, reflecting a 20% decline in\nproduction costs and improvements to\nthe shale model, including faster drilling,\nlarger wells and better resource recovery.\nIn response, more than 200 oil rigs have\nbeen placed in service since their number\ntroughed in May 2016.’ Second, capital\nspending by the US energy sector is\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 75\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014608",
