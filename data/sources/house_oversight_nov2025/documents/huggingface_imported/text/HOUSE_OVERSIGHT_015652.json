  "text": "Mr. Dershowitz agrees to make his client, Jeffrey Epstein, and others with relevant\ntestimony and with whom he has testified he shares a “common interest” — at least Epstein\nand Maxwell — available to any law enforcement agency reviewing any alleged criminal\nactivities; or in the alternative, to attest to this Court that those necessary witnesses have\nconsented to full cooperation in the investigation Mr. Dershowitz is seeking permission to\ninitiate.\n\nMr. Dershowitz agrees to waive the statute of limitations in all jurisdictions for any\ncriminal conduct he participated in or was aware of relating to Ms. Giuffre so that law\nenforcement can pursue any necessary charges. Defendant Dershowitz proclaimed that he\nwas willing to waive any statute of limitation for criminal conduct so this should not be an\nissue. See Exhibit D, January 12, 2016 Deposition Transcript of Alan Dershowitz at 395.\n“T had talked about the statute of limitations for criminal purpose was what I said, that I\nwould waive the statute of limitations for criminal purposes.”\n\nMr. Dershowitz agrees to provide the names and contact information for each State\nAttorney and United States Attorney for which he has or is planning to provide\ninformation relating to Ms. Giuffre; and agrees to jointly, with Ms. Giuffre’s counsel,\nrequest that the State Attorney and United States Attorney, in the relevant jurisdictions,\ninvestigate all potential criminal conduct. Both parties may provide any relevant\ninformation they have that may assist the authorities with their investigation.\n\nFor all other purposes non-party Ms. Giuffre’s January 16, 2016 deposition transcript shall\n\nremain confidential and sealed other than for confidential disclosure to law enforcement as\ndescribed above.\n\n2. Mr. Dershowitz Has No “Evidence” of Perjury And Instead Is Simply Trying To\nBully This Victim\n\nAs explained above, Defendant Dershowitz wrongly suggests to this Court that non-party\n\nVirginia Giuffre has committed perjury in an effort to taint the Court against this victim. His only\n\n“evidence” of this alleged perjury is a self-serving opinion from his retained expert that an\n\n“absence of records” in response to a FOJA request, establishes that former President Clinton was\n\nnever on Jeffrey Epstein’s island in the USVI. Defendant Dershowitz misrepresents the\n\ngovernment’s response. The government is only required to conduct a reasonable search of\n\nreadily accessible records. Accordingly, an “absence of records” response does not mean that\n\nrecords do not exist. It simply means that in the course of the search, no records were found. See\n\nCunningham v. U.S. Dept. of Justice, 961 F.Supp. 2d 226, 236 (D.C. 2013) (court reasoning that\n\n“t]he adequacy of a search is measured by a standard of reasonableness...
