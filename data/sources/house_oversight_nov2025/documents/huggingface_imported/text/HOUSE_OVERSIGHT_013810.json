  "text": "parlor and quickly realize that the big boss’s methods duplicate effort. I do it my way, finish in one hour\ninstead of eight, and spend the rest of the time reading kung-fu magazines and practicing karate kicks\noutside. I am fired in a record three days, left with the parting comment, “Maybe someday you'll\nunderstand the value of hard work.” It seems I still don’t.\n\n1993 I volunteer for a one-year exchange program in Japan, where people work themselves to death—\na phenomenon called karooshi—and are said to want to be Shinto when born, Christian when married,\nand Buddhist when they die. I conclude that most people are really confused about life. One evening,\nintending to ask my host mother to wake me the next morning (okosu), I ask her to violently rape me\n(okasu). She is very confused.\n\n1996 I manage to slip undetected into Princeton, despite SAT scores 40% lower than the average and\nmy high school admissions counselor telling me to be more “realistic.” I conclude ’m just not good at\nreality. I major in neuroscience and then switch to East Asian studies to avoid putting printer jacks on cat\nheads.\n\n1997 Millionaire time! I create an audiobook called How I Beat the Ivy League, use all my money\nfrom three summer jobs to manufacture 500 tapes, and proceed to sell exactly none. I will allow my\nmother to throw them out only in 2006, just nine years of denial later. Such is the joy of baseless\noverconfidence.\n\n1998 After four shot-putters kick a friend’s head in, I quit bouncing, the highest-paying job on\ncampus, and develop a speed-reading seminar. I plaster campus with hundreds of god-awful neon green\nflyers that read, “triple your reading speed in 3 hours!” and prototypical Princeton students proceed to\nwrite “bullsh*t” on every single one. I sell 32 spots at $50 each for the 3-hour event, and $533 per hour\nconvinces me that finding a market before designing a product is smarter than the reverse. Two months\nlater, I’m bored to tears of speed-reading and close up shop. I hate services and need a product to ship.\n\nFall 1998 A huge thesis dispute and the acute fear of becoming an investment banker drive me to\ncommit academic suicide and inform the registrar that I am quitting school until further notice. My dad is\nconvinced that ll never go back, and I’m convinced that my life is over. My mom thinks it’s no big deal\nand that there is no need to be a drama queen.\n\nSpring 1999 In three months, I accept and quit jobs as a curriculum designer at Berlitz, the world’s\nlargest publisher of foreign-language materials, and as an analyst at a three-person political asylum\nresearch firm. Naturally, I then fly to Taiwan to create a gym chain out of thin air and get shut down by\nTriads, Chinese mafia. I return to the U.S. defeated and decide to learn kickboxing, winning the national\nchampionship four weeks later with the ugliest and most unorthodox style ever witnessed.\n\nFall 2000 Confidence restored and thesis completely undone, I return to Princeton. My life does not\nend, and it seems the yearlong delay has worked out in my favor. Twenty-somethings now have David\nKoresh-—like abilities. My friend sells a company for $450 million, and I decide to head west to sunny\nCalifornia to make my billions. Despite the hottest job market in the history of the world, I manage to go\njobless until three months after graduation, when I pull out my trump card and send one start-up CEO 32\nconsecutive e-mails. He finally gives in and puts me in sales.\n\nSpring 2001 TrueSAN Networks has gone from a 15-person nobody to the “number one privately\nheld data storage company” (how is that measured?) with 150 employees (what are they all doing?). I am\nordered by a newly appointed sales director to “start with A” in the phone book and dial for dollars. I ask\nhim in the most tactful way possible why we are doing it like retards. He says, “Because I say so.” Nota\ngood start.\n\nFall 2001 After a year of 12-hour days, I find out that I’m the second-lowest-paid person in the\ncompany aside from the receptionist. I resort to aggressively surfing the web full-time. One afternoon,\nhaving run out of obscene video clips to forward, I investigate how hard it would be to start a sports\nnutrition company. Turns out that you can outsource everything from manufacturing to ad design. Two\nweeks and $5,000 of credit card debt later, I have my first batch in production and a live website.
