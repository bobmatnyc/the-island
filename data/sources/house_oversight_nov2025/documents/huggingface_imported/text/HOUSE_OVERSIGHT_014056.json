  "text": "2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 77\n\nPassed in 1990, the VRRA provided crime victims with a set of procedural\nrights similar to those found in the CVRA, along with rights to notification\nabout victim services.” In 2004, the CVRA repealed and replaced the\nsection of the VRRA listing procedural rights, while leaving other parts of\nthe VRRA intact.°? Under the remaining parts of the VRRA, the Justice\nDepartment must inform victims of federal crimes of services that are\navailable to them, including “emergency medical and social services,”\ncounseling, and support.”’ The Department is further obligated to keep\nvictims fully informed about “the status of the investigation of the crime, to\nthe extent it is appropriate to inform the victim and to the extent that it will\nnot interfere with the investigation.’ These rights to notice about\n“emergency medical and social services”? as well as to the “status of the\ninvestigation of the crime” obviously require the Department to identify\nvictims of federal crimes before formal charges have been filed. Indeed, the\nVRRA makes this point clear by directing the Department to not only notify\nthe victim about the status of the investigation but also about the later\n“filing of charges against a suspected offender.”°’ The VRRA then extends\nvictims’ rights to information through the rest of the criminal justice\nprocess by requiring the Department to provide notice to victims of such\nthings as the imposed sentence and the defendant’s release.*°\n\nThe VRRA not only requires the Department to identify victims during\nthe investigation of a crime, it also defines those victims in a very similar\nfashion to the CVRA. The VRRA defines “victim” as a “person that has\nsuffered direct physical, emotional, or pecuniary harm as a result of the\ncommission of a crime.””’’ Thus, the Department is already routinely\nidentifying persons who have been “harmed” by federal crimes shortly after\nthe commission of those crimes and well before formal charging.\n\nThe Attorney General has also promulgated internal guidelines\nrequiring Justice Department components to identify victims rapidly after a\ncrime. The Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance\nprovide that “Department responsibilities to crime victims begin as soon as\npossible after the detection of a crime at which they may be undertaken\n\n8° See supra notes 22-23 and accompanying text.\n\n°° Justice for All Act of 2004, Pub.
