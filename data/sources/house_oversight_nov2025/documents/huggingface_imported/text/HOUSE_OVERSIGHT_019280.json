  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\ntions of regimes that have been sullied by the jailing of\ndissidents or opposition leaders, the shuttering of media\n\ngenerally because of other strategic concerns or simple\nneglect, not because lobbyists have persuaded them\n\noutlets, or violent attacks on peaceful demonstrators.\n\nIs the money that authoritarians allocate for image\nbeautification well spent? Some campaigns have been\nmore successful than others, but autocracies that\n\nhire well-known former cabinet secretaries or elected\nofficials to defend or deny their acts of repression often\nfail to sway either the public or the policy community\n\nin the United States. If democratic leaders have not\nmounted adequate responses to such repression, it is\n\nthat the regime in question is benevolent and just.\n\nAuthoritarian efforts to change governments, as\nopposed to perceptions, may ultimately prove more\nrewarding. Russias wager on the rise of friendly\nEuropean populist parties already seems to be paying\noff. After Britain's vote to withdraw from the EU and\nthe triumph of Donald Trump in the United States,\nthe prospect of radical shifts in global politics can no\nlonger be dismissed as unthinkable.\n\n1.
