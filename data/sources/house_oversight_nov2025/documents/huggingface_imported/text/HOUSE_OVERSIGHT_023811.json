If history courses were designed to teach\nstudents to think within the context of history, they would be much\nmore important than they now are. As long as we think that history is\nabout getting the facts about who signed what declaration when, we\nare missing the forest for the trees from a teaching point of view.\n\nNow, of course, some subjects lend themselves very easily to em-\nphasis of the 12 cognitive processes. Science courses could, for ex-\nample, be entirely about experimentation or diagnosis or causation,\nand they would be very useful if they were. But instead we encourage\nlearning the facts about who did what experiment and we teach for-\nmulas to be memorized and we teach about equations. Experimenta-\ntion is indeed a very exciting subject. (Ask any 2-year-old who ex-\nperiments with what best goes in his mouth on a daily basis.) But\nschooling manages to make it a very dull subject by teaching who did\nwhat experiment when.\n\nOne reason that we have managed to create dullness out of materi-\nal that can be inherently interesting is the absurd emphasis on testing\nthat has dominated the world of education in the past years. Below\nare three questions (quite typical ones) from an AP psychology exam.\n\nIvan P Pavlov is famous for his research on\n\n(A) teaching machines.\n\n(B) perceptual learning.\n\n(C) forward conditioning.\n(D) classical conditioning.\n(E) backward conditioning.\n\nA stimulus that elicits a response before the experimental\nmanipulation is a (an)\n\n(A) response stimulus (RS).\n\n(B) unconditioned stimulus (UCS).\n(C) generalized stimulus (GS).\n\n(D) conditioned stimulus (CS).\n\n(E) specific stimulus (SS).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023811",
