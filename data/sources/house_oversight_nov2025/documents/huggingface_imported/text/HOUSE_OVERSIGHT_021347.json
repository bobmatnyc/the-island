  "text": "Inferring Minds Where None\nCan Be Seen\n\nThe social brain seeks\nconnections with others. But what is the\nfoundation that we use to build such\nconnections? We experience empathy as\na form of emotional resonance and\nunderstanding of other people. This\nconnection allows us to comfort and\nsupport and celebrate with others. Being\nin tune with emotional states of others\nallows us to respond in ways that\nstrengthen a group. But how do we\nunderstand the thoughts and goals of\nothers? How do we predict choices and\ndecisions to facilitate cooperation in\ngroups? Anthropomorphism is the basis\nfor predicting behavior and thoughts and\ngoals. Nick Epley discusses how\nanthropomorphism is rooted in an\negocentric view of others. Moreover our\nview of others is not confined to the\nothers that are people. It is perhaps\nreflective of the deep and fundamental\nnature of anthropomorphism in the\nsocial brain that its anthropomorphic\ninferences about agents can be derived\nfrom observed behavior, allowing us to\nunderstand “minds” where none may\nexist, as in mechanical toys or alarm\nclocks. Of course we tend to understand\nthose minds by thinking they are just\nlike us.\n\nEven when there is no agent to\nbe seen, events in the world may be\nunderstood by attributing them to unseen\nagents. During World War II, the\nbombing of London was demonstrably\nrandom, but citizens of London could\nnot help but discern intentional patterns\nin the attacks. As Epley points out,\nhurricanes and floods are even today\nattributed to the hand of God, perhaps an\nangry God. Clark Gilpin discusses how\nreligions may use this aspect of the\n\nPage |101\n\nsocial brain to achieve an understanding\nof God and what God wants. This kind\nof anthropomorphism can be taken to\ndifferent metaphoric extremes in\npersonifying God as father or friend.\nBut an overly concrete personification\nmay have costs perhaps diminishing the\nuniversality and pervasiveness of God in\nother religions. Thus religions may\ndiffer in theological perspective on the\nvalue of the anthropomorphic impulse\ninherent in the social brain.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021347",
