  "text": "Among the most important historic achievements we take pride in is the building of the national Emirati identity\nwhich did not exist before the rise of the Union state. This identity settles deep down in the souls of all Emiratis,\nruns in their blood-veins, and fills them with feelings of dignity and loyalty to their country, the UAE.\n\nEvery citizen and person of responsibility in the UAE puts his Emirati national sense of belonging above that of\nhis own area. Basically there is no conflict, but integration, between the two. When a person introduces himself\nas coming from Abu Dhabi, Fujairah, or Dubai, he is not unlike an Egyptian who introduces himself as coming\nfrom Cairo, Asyut, or Alexandria, or a Saudi, who introduces himself as coming from Riyadh, Makkah, or\nDammam.\n\nUnfortunately, some people who do not know the Emirates and the facts of life there, pass judgment on what\n\nthey do not understand. We are, in the words of my brother Sheikh Khalifa, members in one body, strong and\nheld together. There are no sensitivities among the Emirates, but t here is mutual cooperation and help within\nthe one state, the one national identity; and at the same time, within the one state there is room for competition\nin the fields of good deeds achievement, excellence, and the service of the country and citizens.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nDo you support increasing the scope of the federal government’s authorities while\ndecreasing those of local governments towards the overall welfare of the UAE?\n\nThere is no conflict between the local and federal authorities. There are federal and local roles which are clearly\narticulated by the Constitution of the UAE. All sovereign issues fall within the jurisdiction of federal\ngovernment, represented by His Highness, The President, Members of the UAE Supreme Council, The\nCabinet, The Federal National Council, Federal Law.\n\nThe federal government enjoys full authority to carry out its mandate articulated by the Constitution. Extended\nor limited scope of authority is not a theoretical issue. Meanwhile, promoting non-central governmental models\nand offering more authorities to local governments is now a growing trend in different parts of the world, even\nin single region state. Decentralization has proven quite successful in handling development requirements,\nenhancing government performance and increasing productivity of public organizations.\n\nIn the UAE, we are very keen on ensuring complementary roles and responsibilities among ministries and\nfederal authorities and20the local departments and establishments towards achieving highest government\nperformance levels across the UAE.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nIn times of crises, Dubai always comes into the world’s focus. Are you concerned by\ninternational reports highlighting Dubai’s economic shortcomings during the global\nfinancial downturn?\n\nWe are completely aware of our capabilities and we don’t overestimate our abilities. Dubai’s success in\nintroducing a unique developmental model has gained remarkable international recognition. As you know,\nsuccess implies a certain burden that cannot be avoided. The international focus on Dubai is absolutely normal.\nDuring crises, people usually turn their attention to those who have proven a successful track record. The\ncurrent crisis has brought Dubai’s developmental model with all its successes into a tough test. Some have\nspeculated that Dubai will fail this test, simply because they do not know the UAE nor what Dubai has achieved\nbased on solid foundation of knowledge, expertise and business ties across the globe. Dubai’s achievements are\npart of the UAE’s remarkable progress. I know that some people from outside the region have wished that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024941",
