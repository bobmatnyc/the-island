  "text": "OOK Ok\n\nThe fact that Trump and his son-in-law had many things in common did not mean they\noperated on a common playing field. Kushner, no matter how close to Trump, was yet a\nmember of the Trump entourage, with no more ultimate control of his father-in-law than\nanybody else now in the business of trying to control Trump.\n\nStill, the difficulty of controlling him had been part of Kushner’s self-justification or\nrationalization for stepping beyond his family role and taking a senior White House job: to\nexercise restraint on his father-in-law and even—a considerable stretch for the\ninexperienced young man—to help lend him some gravitas.\n\nIf Bannon was going to pursue as his first signature White House statement the travel\nban, then Kushner was going to pursue as his first leadership mark a meeting with the\nMexican president, whom his father-in-law had threatened and insulted throughout the\ncampaign.\n\nKushner called up the ninety-three-year-old Kissinger for advice. This was both to\nflatter the old man and to be able to drop his name, but it was also actually for real advice.\nTrump had done nothing but cause problems for the Mexican president. To bring the\nMexican president to the White House would be, despite Bannon’s no-pivot policy from\nthe campaign’s harshness, a truly meaningful pivot for which Kushner would be able to\nclaim credit (although don’t call it a pivot). It was what Kushner believed he should be\ndoing: quietly following behind the president and with added nuance and subtlety\nclarifying the president’s real intentions, if not recasting them entirely.\n\nThe negotiation to bring Mexican president Enrique Pefia Nieto to the White House\nhad begun during the transition period. Kushner saw the chance to convert the issue of the\nwall into a bilateral agreement addressing immigration—hence a tour de force of\nTrumpian politics. The negotiations surrounding the visit reached their apogee on the\nWednesday after the inaugural, with a high-level Mexican delegation—the first visit by\nany foreign leader to the Trump White House—meeting with Kushner and Reince Priebus.\nKushner’s message to his father-in-law that afternoon was that Pefia Nieto had signed on\nto a White House meeting and planning for the visit could go forward.\n\nThe next day Trump tweeted: “The U.S. has a 60 billion dollar trade deficit with\nMexico. It has been a one-sided deal from the beginning of NAFTA with massive numbers\n...” And he continued in the next tweet ... “of jobs and companies lost. If Mexico is\nunwilling to pay for the badly needed wall, then it would be better to cancel the upcoming\nmeeting ...”\n\nAt which point Pefia Nieto did just that, leaving Kushner’s negotiation and statecraft as\nso much scrap on the floor.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019942",
