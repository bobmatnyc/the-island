The court\nfound it had subject matter jurisdiction\nover defendant Libya, a designated state\nsponsor of terror, pursuant to § 1605(a)(7)\nof the FSIA. Rew, 995 F.Supp. at 329-30.\nNoting that the FSIA provides for person-\nal jurisdiction as long as subject matter\njurisdiction exists and proper service was\neffected, the court turned to Libya’s con-\ntacts with the United States. Jd. at 330\n(citing Burger King, 471 US. at 472, 105\nS.Ct. 2174). It found that Libya’s contacts\nwith the United States were sufficient be-\ncause its allegedly “intentional, tortious ac-\ntions [were] ... ‘expressly aimed at’ the\nUnited States,” and included “destruction\nof a United States flag aircraft ... while\nen route to the United States ... with 189\nUnited States nationals on board.” Jd.\n(citing Calder, 465 U.S. at 789, 104 S.Ct.\n1482). The court concluded that its exer-\ncise of personal jurisdiction was appropri-\nate since “[alny foreign state would know\nthat the United States has substantial in-\nterests in protecting its flag carriers and\nits nationals from terrorist activities and\nshould reasonably expect that if these in-\nterests were harmed, it would be subject\nto a variety of potential responses, includ-\ning civil actions in the United States.” Jd.\n\nSimilarly, in Dalibertt the court found it\nhad subject matter jurisdiction over defen-\ndant Iraq, a designated state sponsor of\nterror, in a case stemming from the al-\nleged torture of several United States citi-\nzens who were working in Kuwait. Dal-\nbertt, 97 F.Supp.2d at 46. Iraq argued\nthat exercising personal jurisdiction over it\nwould offend constitutional due process\nsince the FSIA “abrogates the minimum\ncontacts requirement.” Jd. at 52. The\ncourt disagreed and explained that “Con-\neress expressly addressed the minimum\ncontacts requirement in enacting the FSIA\nby providing that ‘[plersonal jurisdiction\nover a foreign state shall exist as to every\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nclaim for relief over which the district\ncourts have jurisdiction”” Jd. (citing 28\nU.S.C. § 183000); Shapiro v. Republic of\nBolivia, 930 F.2d 1018, 1020 (2d Cir.1991)).\nThe court acknowledged that the foreign\nstate’s contacts with the United States\nmight be more attenuated in the context of\nthe state sponsor of terrorism exception\nthan in the FSIA’s other exceptions, but\nconcluded “in the context of this statute,\nthe purpose for which it was enacted, and\nthe nature of the activity toward which it\nis directed, ... it is reasonable that for-\neign states be held accountable in the\ncourts of the United States for terrorist\nactions perpetrated against U.S. citizens\nanywhere.” Jd. at 54. Finally, it noted\nthat the “detention of these three plaintiffs\nhad a direct effect in the United States\nand was consciously designed to affect\nUnited States policy ... Iraq cannot now\nclaim surprise at the assertion of jurisdic-\ntion by this Court.” Jd.\n\nMost recently, in Pugh, representatives\nof passengers killed in the bombing of a\nFrench airliner in Africa survived a motion\nto dismiss by the individual defendants.\nThe court found it had subject matter ju-\nrisdiction over seven Libyan officials, in-\ncluding Muammar Qadhafi, pursuant to\nthe state sponsor of terrorism exception of\nthe FSIA outlined in § 1605(a)(7). Pugh,\n290 F.Supp.2d at 58. In its personal juris-\ndiction analysis, the court concluded that\nthe individuals had sufficient contacts with\nthe United States to satisfy due process\nsince they had “conspired to sabotage” a\nflight, which was scheduled to “stop in\nseveral nations,” thus making it foresee-\nable that “passengers of many nationalities\nwould be on board.” Jd. at 59. From\ntheir actions, the defendants could have\nexpected to be haled into “the courts of\nthose nations whose citizens would die.”\nId. Given the number of passengers on the\nplane, it was also foreseeable that Ameri-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017873",
