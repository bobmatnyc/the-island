  "text": "Despite General Yoffe’s angry protests in the command post, Avraham had told\nhim what he’d told me back at the base: that once an operation like this was\nunderway, only the commander on the spot could make life-or-death decisions.\nI was “the ramatkal in the field.” But Yoffe had also discovered that his\njerrycans of gasoline were missing. He insisted that if and when I returned\nsafely from the Golan, I be handed over to the military police.\n\nI don’t know what I would have told the general if he’d asked me directly\nwhether I broke into his jeep. But in the mix of celebration and relief that the\nSyrian operation had succeeded, I got away with what amounted to a plea-\nbargain. I promised both Meir Amit and Avraham — at least one of whom\nbelieved me — that it would not happen again.\n\n71\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011542",
