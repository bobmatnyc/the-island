  "text": "of non-familial sociality, we may now\nadd physiological benefits. A 1979\npopulation-based study showed that\nadults lacking social ties were 1.9 to 3.1\ntimes more likely to die during a 9-year\nfollow-up than those who had more\nsocial contacts, all else being equal (2).\nSince then, at least five population-based\nprospective studies (3) and numerous\nsmaller studies have found positive\nassociations between social integration\nand either survival or improved health\noutcomes. The mechanisms by which\nsocial integration enhances survival are\nseveral and include improved health\nbehaviors, increased access to resources\nand material goods, and strengthened\nimmunity against infection (4).\n\nWhereas sociality is a normal\nstate, loneliness is an unusual state, akin\nto hunger, thirst, or pain (5). As with\nthose states, loneliness is unpleasant and\nserves to remind us that we should\nchange the status quo. Therefore,\nloneliness can be an adaptive motivator\nfor increased social surveillance and\ninteraction. Unfortunately, not all\nindividuals succeed at achieving the\nlevel of social connectedness they desire\nand suffer instead from chronic feelings\nof loneliness. Cacioppo and others have\nshown that lonely individuals interpret\nevents and social interactions more\nnegatively than non-lonely individuals.\nAs aresult, they unconsciously develop\ndefense mechanisms, including social\nbarriers, which shield them from insults\nand rejection. While this approach may\nachieve its goals of self-protection, it\nalso reduces opportunities for positive\nsocial interactions and perpetuates\nfeelings of social isolation (5). John\nBunyan, a 17” century Christian writer\nand preacher, described the barriers\nassociated with loneliness when he\nwrote of a vision in which he\n\n131\n\nPage\n\n“saw the people set on the sunny\nside of some high mountain,\nthere refreshing themselves with\nthe pleasant beams of the sun,\nwhile I was shivering and\nshrinking in the cold, afflicted\nwith frost, snow, and dark\nclouds. Methought, also, betwixt\nme and them, I saw a wall that\n\ndid compass about this mountain\n\n(6).”\n\nFor chronically lonely people,\nthe wall between themselves and others\nis partly of their own making and\nreflects continuous surveillance for\nnegative signals from others (5). The\nchallenge is to help lonely individuals\nbreak down the barriers between\nthemselves and others and ultimately\nreturn to the normal state of sociality. In\nhis vision, Bunyan achieved this, but\nonly through great effort:\n\n“About this wall I thought\nmyself, to go again and again,\nstill prying as I went, to see if I\ncould find some way or passage,\nby which I might enter therein,\nbut none could I find for some\ntime. At the last, I saw, as it\nwere, a narrow gap, like a little\ndoorway in the wall, through\nwhich I attempted to pass; but the\npassage being very strait and\nnarrow, I made many efforts to\nget in, but all in vain, even until I\nwas well-nigh quite beat out, by\nstriving to get in; at last, with\ngreat striving, methought I at first\ndid get in my head, and after that,\nby a sidling striving, my\nshoulders, and my whole body;\nthen I was exceeding glad, and\nwent and sat down in the midst\nof them, and so was comforted\nwith the light and heat of their\nsun (6).”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021377",
