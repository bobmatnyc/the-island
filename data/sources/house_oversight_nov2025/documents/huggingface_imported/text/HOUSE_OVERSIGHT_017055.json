Controls. (A) We observe over the same timespan (100 years) two cohorts invented at different\ntimes. Again, the more recent cohort reaches 25% of its peak faster. (B) We verify that inventions have\nalready reached their peak. We calculate the peak of each invention, and plot the distribution of these\npeaks as a function of year, grouping them along the same cohorts as used in the text. In each case, the\ndistribution falls within the bounds of the period observed (1800-2000).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017055",
