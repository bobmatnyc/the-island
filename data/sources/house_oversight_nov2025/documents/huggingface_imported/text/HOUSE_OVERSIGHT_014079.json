  "text": "100 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\n\nOther states also expressly extend nights before the filing of charges.\nColorado guarantees rights at “all critical stages of the criminal justice\nprocess|,]” which includes both the filing of charges and the decision to not\nfile charges.”*> In Missoun, victims have the right:\n\non charged cases or submitted cases where no charge decision has yet been made, to\nbe informed by the prosecuting attorney of the status of the case and of the availability\n[of different forms of compensation and assistance] and of any final decision by the\nprosecuting attorney not to file charges.”*°\n\nIn New Jersey, officials typically send a letter informing the victim “that the\ncase has been referred to the prosecutors’ office and explains and offers the\nservices available from the country office of victim-witness advocacy.””*’\nSubsequent letters to the victim ensure that the victim has notice of a series\nof decisions long before indictment,”* and the office actively solicits\ninformation in order to “help the prosecutor’s office decide whether or not\nto prosecute a case.””*? Along a similar vein, the Massachusetts legislature\nincluded a provision that makes it clear that nothing should prevent a\nprosecutor from providing victim services to persons injured by the\ncommission of a crime, even though a complaint or indictment has not yet\nbeen issued.*”°\n\nIn addition to extending nghts before the filing of charges, several\nstates require consultation before the prosecutor reaches a plea agreement\nwith the defendant. For example, Idaho’s statute provides that a victim\nmust be given an opportunity “to communicate with the prosecution in\ncriminal or juvenile offenses, and be advised of any proposed plea\nagreement by the prosecuting attorney prior to entering into a plea\nagreement in criminal or juvenile offenses involving crimes of violence, sex\n\n35 CoLo. Const. art. II, § 16a; Coxo. REv. Stat. § 24-4.1-302(1) (2013). But see CoLo.\nRev. STAT. § 24-4.1-302.5(1)(f) (2012) (limiting conferral right, in particular, to later stages\nof a criminal proceeding). Despite these limitations on the conferral right, victims retain the\nability to be heard at any hearing involving a plea. See id. § 24-4.1-302.5.\n\n236 Mo. ANN. STAT. § 595.209(10) (West 2011).\n\n237 OFFICE OF VICTIM-WITNESS ADvocacy, N.J. DEP’T of LAW & Pup. SAFETY, A CRIME\nVICTIM’S GUIDE TO THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM 4 (2d ed. 1997), see also N.J. Const. art. I,\n§ 22. Compare 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (2012), with N.J. Stat. ANN. § 52:4B-36 (West 2009). In\naddition to the rights similar to the federal legislation, New Jersey law provides for the right\n“tlo be advised of case progress and final disposition and to confer with the prosecutor’s\nrepresentative so that the victim may be kept adequately informed ... .” Id. § 52:4B-36(k).\n\n238 See OFFICE OF VICTIM-WITNESS ADVOCACY, supra note 237, at 4 (including pre-grand\njury remand, administrative dismissal, grand jury remand, grand jury dismissal, and\nindictment returned).\n\n239 Id. at 26 (describing victim involvement at grand jury and arraignment stages of the\nproceeding).\n\n240 See Mass.
