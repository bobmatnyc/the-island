Dave,

Talk about a small world. I got on the airplane Saturday night and opened up the Palm Beach newspaper and
here’s what I found (see attached). Remember “Bear”, Warren’s friend from NY. Well, he is a Billionaire
(Literally and really) and always seems to be in the news in South Florida. He competes with Trump on big
property deals and seems to be quite the womanizer. The only problem is he goes after some of the young ones

sometimes and must not check there ID’s.

Oh well, I thought you might get a kick out of this article. What a small world.

Take good care!!

Doug
