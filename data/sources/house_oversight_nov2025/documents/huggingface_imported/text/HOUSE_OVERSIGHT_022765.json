  "text": "incredulous and apoplectic that Epstein not only walks free but prospers too.\n\nAlthough he has spent more than a year in jail and paid out what may\nbe as much as $20 million, he yet seems somehow to have gotten away with\nit—that worst sin of all. He is the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute\nbadness: the financier whose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather\nthan work; a rich middle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and\nentitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent Playboy in a\ncorrect and prudish world—someone who somehow didn’t get the memo\nabout vast changes in mores and culture.\n\nWhen I suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the animus\nwould be to get married, he said he’d rather go back to jail.\n\nHe is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come to life.\n\nThis is all, of course, a Gatsby-like tale: An enigmatic, and strangely\nappealing figure, able to invent and inhabit his own world is a mystery to try\nto decipher. Of course Gatsby in New York Post and Daily Mail parlance\nwould likely be just a freaky financier too.\n\nAnd this story is, in its way, about the limitation of journalism, in\nwhich the most compelling parts of the tale—Epstein’s ambitions and\nimpulses would be well suited to a long running cable drama—need to be\nsacrificed not just to moral certainty but to a rather preposterous fantasy of\nmoral certainty.\n\nAnyway, I hope I get invited back to Jeffrey’s house soon.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022765",
