  "text": "ABUSE:\n[theory] Thinking More Clearly About BDSM versus Abuse\n\nI wrote this post in 2011. As I noted in the intro to \"The Alt Sex Anti-Abuse Dream\nTeam,\" other BDSMers have been writing about this more and more, and the discussion\nis really heating up right now, in 2012. Thomas MacAulay Millar has a particularly good\nseries of posts on the topic, starting with:\n\nhttp://vesmeansyesblog. wordpress.com/2012/03/23/theres-a-war-on-part-1-troubles-\nbeen-brewing/\n\nKK Ok\n\nThinking More Clearly About BDSM versus Abuse\n\nYears ago, when I first started thinking about BDSM and abuse, I -- like a lot of feminist\nBDSMers -- was defensive.\n\nWe get scared of the accusation that \"BDSM is always abuse\"... and we're accustomed to\naccusations from certain feminists such as \"those of you who pretend to like BDSM just\nhave Patriarchy Stockholm Syndrome and don't know what you really want\"... and often,\nwe're also fighting our own inner BDSM stigma demons. We get angry that our sexual\nneeds are seen as politically problematic, or unimportant.\n\nAnd so, for a lot of people, our instinctive angle on abuse in the BDSM community is:\n\"Shut up! That's not what's going on!\" And that's a problem.\n\nObviously, I don't think BDSM is inherently abusive! Exploring my personal BDSM\ndesires has given me some extraordinary, consensual, transcendent experiences and\nconnections. I also genuinely believe that BDSM has the potential to control, subvert, and\nmanage power. BDSM can be a place where people learn to understand bad power\ndynamics in past relationships; it can be a place where people learn to manage or\ndestroy bad power dynamics in their current relationships; it can be a place where\npeople find glory, self-knowledge and freedom by manipulating their own reactions\nand responses to power. The sex theorist Pepper Mint has a great, complicated essay\nabout this called \"Towards a General Theory of BDSM and Power\". And here's one of\nmy favorite quotations on the matter, from a submissive and former blogger who went by\nvioletwhite:\n\nIt's ironic that the most perverse manipulations of power in my life occurred in a past\nvanilla relationship, where I tolerated tyranny because the normative structure of our\nrelationship obscured the fact that that is what it was.\n\nStill, I've seen things happen in the BDSM community that turned my stomach. Terrible\nmanipulative behavior exhibited by people who have the greatest reputations. Blaming\nthe victim when they try to speak up. Telling \"rumor mongers\" to shut up when people\nare trying to talk openly about problematic community members. The BDSM subculture\nhas its own version of rape culture, where \"lying bitch\" and \"drama queen\" and\n\"miscommunication\" are used against abuse survivors. Miscommunications do happen...\nbut not everything that could be a miscommunication is actually a miscommunication.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018647",
