  "text": "14\n\nAfter 20 years of failed peace talks, is it possible that the two\nsides' positions on borders, refugees and other issues are just\nunbridgeable and no amount of talks will make a difference?\n\nPeace between conflicting parties is not about Saeb Erekat waking up\none morning and feeling his conscience aching for Israelis or Israelis\nwaking up and feeling their conscience aching for my suffering. It's\nabout the matrix of interests maturing. Once any conflicting party\nbelieves that making peace is cheaper than continuing war, he'll do it.\nOur matrix of interest has matured to deliver the requirement for\npeace, but Israel hasn't opened the door. They think maintaining the\nstatus quo is best for them. We are trying to show them that the status\nquo is not sustainable.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025010",
