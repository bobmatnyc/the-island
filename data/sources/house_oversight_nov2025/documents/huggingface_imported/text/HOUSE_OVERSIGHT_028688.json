His message is expected to be\ntwofold: Israel should not delay in granting\nstatehood to the Palestinians, however\npainful that choice may be, and it should be\ncareful not to make an eternal enemy of\nIran. Both conflicts have the potential to\nisolate Israel internationally and threaten its\nlong-term interests, if not its actual\nexistence.\n\nIn his first term of office, Obama resisted\nNetanyahu’s pressure to wage war on Iran.\nThis was no more than a semi-success,\nhowever, since he managed to blunt\nNetanyahu’s belligerence only by imposing\non Iran a raft of sanctions of unprecedented\nseverity. They have halved Iran’s oil\nexports, caused its currency to plummet\nand inflation to gallop, severed its relations\nwith the world’s banks and inflicted severe\nhardship on its population.\n\nThe key question today is this: What are\nObama’s intentions? Is he seeking to bring\ndown Iran’s Islamic regime, as Israel\nwould like, or is he simply seeking to limit\nits nuclear ambitions? If ‘regime change’ is\nhis aim then sanctions will have to be\ntightened even further and extended\nindefinitely.
