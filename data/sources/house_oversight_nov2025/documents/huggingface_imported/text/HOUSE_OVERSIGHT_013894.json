  "text": "Step One: Pick an Affordably Reachable Niche Market\n\nWhen I was younger ... I [didn’t] want to be pigeonholed ... Basically, now you want to be\npigeonholed. It’s your niche.\n\n—JOAN CHEN, actress; appeared in The Last Emperor and Twin Peaks\n\nCC eating demand is hard. Filling demand is much easier. Don’t create a product, then seek someone\n\nto sell it to. Find a market—define your customers—then find or develop a product for them.\n\nI have been a student and an athlete, so I developed products for those markets, focusing on the male\ndemographic whenever possible. The audiobook I created for college guidance counselors failed because\nI have never been a guidance counselor. I developed the subsequent speed-reading seminar after\nrealizing that I had free access to students, and the business succeeded because —being a student myself\n—I understood their needs and spending habits. Be a member of your target market and don’t speculate\nwhat others need or will be willing to buy.\n\nStart Small, Think Big\n\nSome people are just into lavish dwarf entertainment.\n\n—DANNY BLACK (42”), part-owner of Shortdwarf.com2>\n\nDanny Black rents dwarfs as entertainment for $149 per hour. How is that for a niche market?\n\nIt is said that if everyone is your customer, then no one is your customer. If you start off aiming to sell\na product to dog- or car-lovers, stop. It’s expensive to advertise to such a broad market, and you are\ncompeting with too many products and too much free information. If you focus on how to train German\nshepherds or a restoration product for antique Fords, on the other hand, the market and competition\nshrink, making it less expensive to reach your customers and easier to charge premium pricing.\n\nBrainQUICKEN was initially designed for students, but the market proved too scattered and difficult\nto reach. Based on positive feedback from student-athletes, I relaunched the product as BodyQUICK and\ntested advertising in magazines specific to martial artists and powerlifters. These are minuscule markets\n\ncompared to the massive student market, but not small. Low media cost and lack of competition enabled\n\nme to dominate with the first “neural accelerator’”2® in these niches. It is more profitable to be a big fish\n\nin a small pond than a small undefined fish in a big pond. How do you know if it’s big enough to meet\nyour TMI? For a detailed real-life example of how I determined the market size of a recent product, see\n“Muse Math” on this book’s companion site.\n\nAsk yourself the following questions to find profitable niches.\n\n1. Which social, industry, and professional groups do you belong to, have you belonged to, or do\nyou understand, whether dentists, engineers, rock climbers, recreational cyclists, car restoration\naficionados, dancers, or other?\n\nLook creatively at your resume, work experience, physical habits, and hobbies and compile a list of all\nthe groups, past and present, that you can associate yourself with. Look at products and books you own,\ninclude online and offline subscriptions, and ask yourself, “What groups of people purchase the same?”\nWhich magazines, websites, and newsletters do you read on a regular basis?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013894",
