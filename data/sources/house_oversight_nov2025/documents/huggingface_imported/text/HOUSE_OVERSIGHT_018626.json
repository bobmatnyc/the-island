  "text": "\"But I'm pretty sure I don't want to,\" I said.\n\nLater, when Mr. Ambition mentioned that he doesn't usually know how he's feeling, he\nadded: \"My friends can often tell more about my own emotions than I can.\"\n\n\"So you basically outsource your emotional processing to your friends?\" I asked.\n\nHe agreed.\n\nPerhaps the worst omen was when Mr. Ambition told me, \"I've never been hurt by love.\"\n\"Never?\" I asked.\n\n\"Never,\" he said.\n\nHis certainty was so great that, in itself, it made me uneasy. Because I have definitely\nbeen hurt by love. And my greatest wounds were dealt by men who seemed sure they\nloved me. A man who seems sure might actually be sure, but he may simply fail to\nunderstand himself... So these days, it's always men who seem certain that make me\nmost uncertain.\n\nThere's another great quotation from that Monica Ali novel, Brick Lane. Here it is: \"The\nthing about getting older is you don't need everything to be possible anymore, you just\nneed some things to be certain.”\n\nTK OK ok\n\nI often felt like I was watching the relationship from a distance. I tried to resist thinking\nof our relationship using cold, manipulative pickup artist terminology and tactics, but\nsometimes I couldn't stop myself. I'd rather not talk about that.\n\nI found more and more ways to manage my incentives. I noticed that one of my methods\nwas telling friends and parents that I liked Mr. Ambition a whole lot. I think it was even\ntrue.\n\nMost of all, I told myself that the lack of natural chemistry was a good thing, and not a\nbad thing; the lack of natural chemistry was why this relationship could last.\n\nI was quite calculating about it, really, and maybe that was why he broke up with me. On\nthe bright side, I kept my head during the breakup, which was nice, because I didn't keep\nmy head during my last breakup. With Mr. Ambition, I didn't feel like my self-control\nslipped at all.\n\n\"We need to talk,\" Mr. Ambition said without preamble, when I met him in the foyer of\nhis apartment building. \"I'm having some concerns about our relationship.\" Once we were\nin his apartment, he said, \"To be honest, I don't know how attracted I am to you.”\n\nI tried to measure his mien. I got the feeling, again, that energy was coiled tightly inside\nhim. Like a dragon. \"Are you breaking up with me?\" I asked.\n\n\"We're just having a conversation,” he said quickly.\n\nWe talked about sex for a while. Chemistry. \"I don't think I like S&M, to be honest,\" he\nsaid. \"I don't feel affected by it.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018626",
