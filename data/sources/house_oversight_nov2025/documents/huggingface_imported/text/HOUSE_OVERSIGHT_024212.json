Nuclear policy will continue\nto be reviewed — notably the decision whether to restart nuclear power plants — which will affect the\nutilities’ long-term fuel mix and therefore cost base.\n\nFor example, Kansai Electric Power, which has the largest exposure to nuclear generation after Tokyo\nElectric, stopped paying dividends after the nuclear shutdown. Every 1% change in its nuclear fleet\nutilization rate will affect earning by almost 10% over a normalized level; nuclear policy decisions can thus\ncreate outcomes for share prices of +/- 50%.\n\nThe ripples from changing nuclear policy will have a long-lasting impact, both negative and positive, on\ncompanies involved in the nuclear value chain (e.g., reactor manufacturers such as Mitsubishi Heavy) and\nother power-related sectors such as gas and renewable energy. Relative to other regions, Japanese\nutilities will be the most affected by macro factors (e.g. the Yen, interest rates, fossil fuel prices, etc.).\n\nBelow is a partial list of structural changes driving long/short opportunities in Japan:\n\nElectron’s structural changes: Japan\n\ne = Fukushima incident’s impact on Japan’s power-related sectors such as LNG and power equipment\ne Derating of sector as a result of the government’s response to Fukushima\n\ne Restart of nuclear plants with Abe administration and prefecture support\n\ne Fuel cost impact from Yen depreciation\n\ne Movement to higher value-added renewable energy systems\n\n11 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024212",
