  "text": "Eurasia Group: Investment\nManagement\n\n‘The Three Principal Players Have Different Perspectives” Division\n\nNational Security Advisor John Bolton\n\nem\n\n= “Bolton wants a crisis. He hopes to use the pressure as a maximum containment strategy to cripple the\nIranian economy, increasing domestic opposition to the government, and making regime change more\nlikely.\n\n» ... ‘forcing’ the Americans to engage in military intervention for Bolton [is] a useful pretext to bombing\nkey nuclear facilities that would set the Iranian program back years or more.”\n\nSecretary of State Mike Pompeo\n\n= “Pompeo wants the band back together. He doesn’t believe the United States can credibly induce the\nIranians towards a more constructive posture by themselves, and accordingly wants a tougher, common\nfront to force better terms from Iran from a position of strength.\n\n= Pompeo hopes the Europeans and other allies will be more supportive of broader American pressure\nagainst Iran, and a multilateral coalition can come back together.”\n\nPresident Trump\n\n= “President Trump wants a breakthrough on his terms. He wants to use American power to force the\nIranians into direct negotiations, and pull off a better agreement than Obama did.”\n\n5\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026949\n\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, lan Bremmer, “EG Update,” Eurasia Group, May 20, 2019.
