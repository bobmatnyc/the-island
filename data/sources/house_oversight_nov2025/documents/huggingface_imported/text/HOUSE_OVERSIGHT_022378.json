  "text": "House profile\n\nBy retaining control of the House and Senate, with the loss of only a few seats, and winning the White House, Republicans\nbelieve they have a mandate to govern. The potential for a Freedom Caucus challenge to Paul Ryan’s leadership is unlikely\ngiven the party’s strong showing. The path is clear for the Speaker to pursue the policy actions described in the “Better\nWay” policy platform developed earlier this year and promoted through the ubiquitous presence of a pamphlet describing\nthe plan that he used during the campaign and press appearances. That effort generated interest from Trump, who\nadapted his tax plan to reflect some of the proposals.\n\nThe week following the electionsand prior to Thanksgiving will be focused on internal party organizational issues,\nincluding the election of party leadership, and discussion around Republican conference and Democratic caucusrules and\nthe makeup of the Steering Committee, which will determine committee assignments. The leadership of the chamber will\nbe decided in closed-door meetings during this time, with a formal floor vote for Speaker in January. Some Steering\nCommittee decisions regarding committees are likely to take place after Thanksgiving and to include ratification of\ncommittee chairmanships and Speaker-appointed committee memberships, as well as appointments of membersto vacant\nslotson “A” committees (including Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce and Financial Services). Ryan and Democratic\nLeader Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) will conduct a negotiation to determine committee ratios, which would be expected to be close\nto what they are now.\n\nChairman Kevin Brady (R-TX) Ranking Member Sander Levin (D-Ml)\n\nRepublican members Boustany and Young ran for Senate ,and Rep. Robert Dold (R-IL) lost his re-election campaign,\nleaving three open seats. Republicans under consideration for Committee seats include Reps. Carlos Curbelo (R-FL), Mike\nBishop (R-Ml), Bradley Byrne (R-AL), Jackie Walorski (R-IN) and Andy Barr (R-KY). Longtime Democratic members Charles\nRangel (D-NY) and Jim McDermott (D-WA) are retiring.\n\nChair John Shimkus(R-IL)/ Greg Walden (R-OR) Ranking Member Frank Pallone (D-NJ}\n\nRep. Fred Upton (R-Ml) will reach his term limit as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee and will step down at\nthe end of the current Congress. Rep. Upton noted that he’s “not planning to” seek a waiver of the term limits. The two\ncurrent frontrunners to replace the outgoing chairman include Reps. John Shimkus (R-IL) and Greg Walden (R-OR). Rep.\nShimkus has seniority on the committee, but Walden has also generated party support related to his role serving as\nchairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee for the past two election cycles. Rep. Joe Barton (R-TX) is\nalso expected to run for the Chairmanship. The powerful Republican Steering Committee, consisting of Republican\nleadership as well as rank-and-file members, will decide in a private meeting who willlead the committeein the 115\nCongress. Adding to the leadership shuffle at the Energy and Commerce Committee, the current chairman of the E&C\nSubcommittee on Health, Rep. Joe Pitts (R-PA), is retiring at the end of the Congress. Rep. Tim Murphy (R-PA) is under\nconsideration to replace him.\n\nChairman Virginia Foxx (R-NC) Ranking Member Bobby Scott (D-VA)\n\nCurrent Chairman John Kline (R-MN) did not seek reelection. He will likely be succeeded as chair of the House Education\nand Workforce Committee by Rep. Foxx. She has had a limited role on pension and retirement issues, but has beena\nreliable voice for limited government regulation and joined in opposing the Obama Administration’s investment advice\nregulations. Where Chairman Kline put pension reform high on the committee’s agenda, Foxx has not signaled a strong\ninterest in making pension issues a priority.\n\nEY 6 | Election2016\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022378",
