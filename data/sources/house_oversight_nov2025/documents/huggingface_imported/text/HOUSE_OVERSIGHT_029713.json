  "text": "But this will all be for naught without\nbetter governance, argues Gurcharan Das,\nthe former C.E.O. of Procter & Gamble\nIndia, whose latest book is “India Grows\nat Night: A Liberal Case for a Strong\nState.” “The aspirational India has no one\nto vote for, because no one is talking the\nlanguage of public goods. Why should it\ntake us 15 years to get justice in the\ncourts or 12 years to build a road? The\ngap between [youth] aspirations and\ngovernment performance is huge. My\nthesis is that India has risen despite the\nstate. It is a story of public failure and\nprivate success.”\n\nThat is what Das means by India grows at\nnight, when government sleeps. “But\nIndia must learn to grow during the day,”\nhe said. “If India fixes its governance\nbefore China fixes its politics that 1s who\nwill win. ... You need a strong state and a\nstrong society, so the society can hold the\nstate accountable. India will only get a\nstrong state when the best of society join\nthe government, and China will only get\na strong society when the best Mandarins\ngo into the private sector.”\n\nArticle 5.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029713",
