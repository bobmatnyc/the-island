  "text": "You have a bomb of colored string that your retarded children have formed , It has to be very carefully\nunwound , even the substitution of Barry for your next trustee, needs a careful focus on procedure.s It would\nbe much preferable if Wechsler was not his replacement. do you have any person you trust ??!. Iam\nconcermed re brad taking barrys place re XXXX. In the beginning Barry will need to find and learn\nACCURATE .. org charts. books , balance sheets . trust valuations. are alla part. Barry will need 2 months\nto just get his arm around what is there , this is before any needed modifications.,\n\na way overdue re- fresh of your estate plan. . clats , trust. partnerships. grats. Ilcs. bank accounts , filing\nrequirements. etc. the long awaited review of the brh tra and shareholders agreement to see how they fit into\nnew plan. . \"XXXXX\" planning. art partnership engagement .. , airplane re-do. , buying another. .? boat\nsale , Miami sale. . TRADING ACCOUNTS. . three years overdue. . an accounting system. fire john\n.. Joslin stays for a year. or so. so does tom and . except for heather everyone should be replaced with\nnew. . Sell Artspace and shut down regan arts. . rationalize. cash flow reporting. cash mgmt. stock\nsales. sec irs. gaming. foreign reporting. the 8865 mess will take months to review now. . you\nCANNOT file unreviewed audited documents. .CANNOT!!! _ this will be very detailed work. . a self\ninflicted wound - all avoidable if professionals had been in place to limit . or contain it. . . you will need\n3 new hires .as there is no one in your office that is truly an A player. I have great hope in Barry as you\nknow. He will need to be trained. note\n; One year is my guesstimate After 4 years of telling you , that you could do better than Halperin, : im glad\nthat you now are willing to follow barrys advice . I take no offense , in fact I take comfort in the fact that after\nonly one conversation with Barry you are now convinced to make that change . will take a year or more.\n\nI expect as a friend you will understand that\n\nI will no longer , not even for one day , work on your affairs . without the compensation that is long\noverdue. . your unilateral idea of after care , not imposed on any other professional , except me, not paul\nweiss ,( caesars alone , a direct screw up on their part ) tom, akin, , no one. needs toend.. you and I had\npreviously agreed no more of that , and this after you decided not to pay me per our agreement. to be fair I can\nnot sayim surprised as you have email after email , stating that , if you save a great deal of money, you\nwont want to pay , so limit it to 40m per year. - water under the bridge\n\nIf I can find the time to work , on your project , which is not by any means certain as Ihave said, I hope\nyou understand that it now will have to be under my standard terms and conditions. and well documented so as\nto avoid any more of the he said she said. I never want to have any more uncomfortable money moments with\nyou , I find it very distasteful. . soto beclear , my terms are as follows. I will only work for the usual 40\nmillion per year. It needs to be paid, 25 million upon signing an agreement. 5 million every 2 months\nthereafter for 6 months ie march may june . this can begin ifi am able in January. I will immediately stop\nwork , if the payment is not received. If you want me to work this year until Jan 15, it will be 10\nmillion. paid upfront. after one year you will be left with a new estate plan a running office. staffed with\nprofessionals overseen by Barry. (hallelujah ) a tax plan . and an investment that returns more than any\npainting you could possible own. _. no agreement - no work. however - I of course will talk to Barry for the\nhour that i promised , and take your guidance as to what I should say.\n\nher the last two places. ?\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella\nLeon please read the attached proposed response to the IRS__, see if you can understand it !!!._ Ive asked for a\nre-do. and given prelimiary directions to Alan to have it edited over the weekend\n\nIf you are quarterbacking ,ok with me. just please let everyone know. you must deal with the outrageous\nincompetence in your family office...
