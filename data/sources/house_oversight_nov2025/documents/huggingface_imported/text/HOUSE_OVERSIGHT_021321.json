Small, M.D.,\nPh.D., a Professor of Neurology and Psychology,\nAssociate Chair for Research in Neurology,\nMember of the Committees on Neurobiology and\nComputational Neuroscience, and Senior Fellow,\nComputation Institute, at The University of\nChicago. He is currently Director of the Human\nNeuroscience Laboratory and was founder of the\nBrain Research Imaging Center. He is an elected\nmember of the American Neurological\nAssociation, a fellow of the American Academy\nof Neurology, and Editor-in-Chief of the\ninternational journal Brain and Language.\nSmall’s research concerns the neural basis of\nhuman language and its breakdown after injury.\nHe has published more than 120 scientific\narticles, primarily about human language, from\nthe perspectives of artificial intelligence,\ncognitive psychology, computational\nneuroscience, human systems neuroscience, and\nclinical neurology.\n\nHuman language represents a unique\nproduct of our social species and the tremendous\nevolution of the primate cerebral cortex\nsimultaneously supported the development of\nboth. Language 1s the defining feature of our\nspecies: In his 12\" century volume, Guide to the\nPerplexed, Maimonides viewed it as tautological\nthat man is a speaking animal, 1.c., “there is no\nthird element besides life and speech in the\ndefinition of man”. But how does the brain\nimplement this unique function in the context of\nits common ontogeny with social function? The\ncurrent essay discusses the possibility that the\nrecently discovered “mirror neurons” of the\ncerebral cortex of macaque monkeys play a\nspecial role in the ability of humans to\nunderstand each other with language by using a\nmechanism of observation and covert emulation.\nIf the neurobiology of language were partly\ngrounded on such systems of visual observation\nand imitation, this would overlap integrally with\nthe biology of the social brain.\n\nx Bjactivity\n\nPage |75\n\nHidden Forces in Understanding\nOthers:\nMirror Neurons and Neurobiological\nUnderpinnings\n\nIt is one thing to perceive objects\nin the environment and another to\nunderstand what is perceived. A rodent\nthat senses an apple definitely has a\nnotion that this represents something\nedible. A monkey might realize that the\napple can be eaten but also can be\nthrown. A human might perceive it as a\nfood, an object to be propelled, a\ntemptation that should be resisted, or\nsomething that falls out of a tree at a\nspecific acceleration. For each individual\nanimal or person, understanding an apple\nmeans to take the sensory perceptions of\nthe apple and to use previous experience\nand knowledge to fit it into an overall\ncontext. In this way, understanding a\nparticular apple depends on our\npreviously having seen, touched, and\nsmelled apples, eaten them, read about\nthem, and perhaps even been hit by a\nfalling or thrown apple. All of our\nprevious experiences come to bear every\ntime we encounter a new perception that\nwe must make sense of, and of course,\nthis represents virtually every moment of\nour waking lives.\n\nOur perceptions vary enormously\nfrom seeing simple objects (e.g., apples),\ntaking in more complex entities (e.g.,\nrestaurants, neighborhoods), hearing\nnoises or speech, and seeing actions\n(e.g., simple manual actions, sporting\nevents). A major question for brain\nresearch is how we can possibly\nunderstand all these different kinds of\ninput, and what brain circuits are used to\ndo so. We assume that such an\nunderstanding means taking these inputs,\nweighing them against our previous\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021321",
