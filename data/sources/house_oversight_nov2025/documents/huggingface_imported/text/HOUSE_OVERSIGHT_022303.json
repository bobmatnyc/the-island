First,\nonly Congress, not the Board, has the\nauthority to ‘create a new unfair labor\npractice.” 141 Second, even if the Board\npossesses such authority, it has not\nidentified the Section 7 rights that\nwould be interfered with by an\nemployer’s failure to post the notice.142\nThird, “interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing],\nor coercling]’’ employees within the\nmeaning of NLRA Section 8(a)(1)\nnecessarily involves action, not failure\nto act; therefore, failure to post the\nnotice cannot violate Section 8(a)(1).14%\nThe Board finds no merit in any of these\ncontentions.\n\nTo begin with, it is incorrect to say\nthat the Board lacks the authority to find\nthat failure to post the notice violates\nSection 8(a)(1) without Congressional\napproval. It is true, as the Society for\nHuman Resource Management states,\nthat “Section 10(a) of the Act\nspecifically limits the NLRB’s powers to\npreventing only the unfair labor\npractices listed in Section 8 of the Act.\nSection 8 is silent regarding any notice\nposting requirement (emphasis in\noriginal).’”” However, as the Supreme\nCourt remarked long ago,\n\nThe [NLRA] did not undertake the\nimpossible task of specifying in precise and\nunmistakable language each incident which\nwould constitute an unfair labor practice. On\nthe contrary that Act left to the Board the\nwork of applying the Act’s general\nprohibitory language in the light of the\ninfinite combinations of events which might\nbe charged as violative of its terms. Thus a\n“rigid scheme of remedies” is avoided and\nadministrative flexibility within appropriate\nstatutory limitations obtained to accomplish\nthe dominant purpose of the legislation.\n\nRepublic Aviation Corporation v. NLRB,\n324 U.S. 793, 798 (1945) (citation\nomitted). Accordingly, since its\ncreation, the Board in interpreting\nSection 8(a)(1) has found numerous\nactions as to which “Section 8 is\n\nsilent” —e.g., coercively interrogating\nemployees about their protected\nconcerted activities, engaging in\n\n140 Consistent with precedent, it will be unlawful\nfor an employer to threaten or retaliate against an\nemployee for filing charges or testifying in a Board\nproceeding involving an alleged violation of the\nnotice-posting requirement. NLRA Sections 8(a)(1),\n8(a)(4), 29 U.S.C. 158(a)(1), (4); Romar Refuse\nRemoval, 314 NLRB 658 (1994).\n\n141 See, e.g., comments of FMI, Assisted Living\nFederation of America (ALFA).\n\n142 See, e.g., comment of U. S. Chamber of\nCommerce.\n\n143 See, e.g., comments of Employment and Labor\nLaw Committee, Association of Corporate Counsel\n(“ACC”); California Chamber of Commerce\n(California Chamber); and National Council of\nAgricultural Employers (NCAE).\n\nsurveillance of employees’ union\nactivities, threatening employees with\nretaliation for engaging in protected\nactivities—to violate Section 8(a)(1) by\n“interfer[ing] with, restrain[ing], or\ncoerc[ing] employees in the exercise of\nthe rights guaranteed in section 7” of\nthe NLRA. Section 8 is equally silent\nconcerning unions’ duty to inform\nemployees of their rights under NLKB v.\nGeneral Motors, above, and\nCommunications Workers v. Beck,\nabove, before attempting to obligate\nthem pursuant to a union-securily\nclause, yet the Board finds that a\nunion’s failure to provide that notice\nrestrains and coerces employees in\nviolation of Section 8(b)(1)(A).\nCalifornia Saw & Knife Works, above,\n320 NLRB at 233, 259, 261.144\n\nBecause, as described in detail above,\nnotice posting is necessary to ensure\neffective exercise of Section 7 rights, a\nrefusal to post the required notice is at\nleast an interference with employees’\nexercise of those rights. For these\nreasons, in finding that an employer’s\nfailure to post the required notice\ninterferes with, restrains, or coerces\nemployees in the exercise of their NLRA\nrights, in violation of Section 8(a)(1), the\nBoard is acting consistently with its\nsettled practice. Some comments claim\nthat the Board has not identified any\nspecific Section 7 right to justify this\nremedy. But such specificity is not\nneeded, because all Section 7 rights are\nimplicated by an employer’s failure to\npost the required notice. As previously\nstated, there is a strong nexus between\nknowledge of Section 7 rights and their\nfree exercise. It therefore follows that an\nemployer’s failure to post this notice,\nwhich informs employees of their\nSection 7 rights, reasonably tends to\ninterfere with the exercise of such\nrights.\n\nFinally, although most violations of\nthe NLRA involve actions rather than\nfailures to act, there are instances in\nwhich a failure to act may be found to\ninterfere with, restrain, or coerce\nemployees in the exercise of their\nSection 7 rights. Thus, a union’s failure\nto provide the required notices under\nNLRB v. General Motors, above, and\n\n144 See Harkin and Miller. Although the Board\nsuggested in a footnote in California Saw that there\nwas no obligation to inform employees of their\nSection 7 rights, 320 NLRB at 232 n. 42, this dicta\nmerely indicated that no such obligation had yet\nbeen recognized in that particular context. To the\nextent it could be read as denying that such an\nobligation may exist, it is the considered view of the\nBoard that this reading must be rejected. Similarly,\nthe statement in U.S. Postal Service, 241 N.L.R.B.\n141, 152 (1979), regarding affirmative notice\nobligations is limited to Weingarten rights, and, in\nany event, does not suggest that notice of NLRA\nrights may never be required.\n\nCommunications Workers v. Beck,\nabove, violates Section 8(b)(1)(A) of the\nNLRA. California Saw & Knife Works,\nabove, 320 NLRB at 233, 259, 261. An\nemployer that fails or refuses to execute\nan agreed-to collective-bargaining\nagreement on request of the union\nviolates Section 8(d), 8(a)(5) and,\nderivatively, Section 8(a)(1). An\nemployer that fails to provide relevant\ninformation requested by the union that\nrepresents the employer’s employees\nviolates Section 8(a)(5) and (1). See, e.g.,\nNLEB v. Truitt Mfg. Co., 351 U.S. 149\n(1956).\n\nThe NLRA’s recognition that a failure\nto perform a legal duty may constitute\nunlawful interference, coercion or\nrestraint is not unique. Courts have\nexpressly held that the failure to post\nnotice required by regulation can be an\n“interference” with employee Family\nand Medical Leave Act rights. In a\nprovision that “largely mimics thle\nlanguage of] § 8(a)(1) of the NLRA,”\nBachelder v. Am. W. Airlines, 259 F. 3d\n1112, 1123 (9th Cir. 2001), the FMLA\nstates that “‘[i]t shall be unlawful for any\nemployer to interfere with, restrain, or\ndeny the exercise of or the attempt to\nexercise, any right provided under this\ntitle.” 29 U.S.C. 2615(a)(1). In\ninterpreting this language, the\nDepartment of Labor’s regulations\nspecifically state that failure to post the\nrequired notice of FMLA rights “may\nconstitute an interference with,\nrestraint, or denial of the exercise of an\nemployee’s FMLA rights” under section\n2615(a)(1). 29 CFR 825.300(e). Courts\nhave agreed, finding that the failure to\nprovide FMLA notices is an “adverse\naction” against the employee that\nsupports a prima facie case of\ninterference. Greenwell v. Charles\nMachine Works, Inc., (W.D. Ok. April\n15, 2011); Smith v. Westchester County,\n(S.D.N.Y. February 14, 2011).\nAccordingly, the Board finds no\nimpediment to declaring that an\nemployer’s failure to post the required\nnotice will violate Section 8(a)(1).145\n\nAs it explained in the NPRM,\nhowever, the Board expects that, in\npractice, few violations will be found\nfor failures to post the notice. The Board\nanticipates that most employers that fail\nto post the notice will do so because\nthey are unaware of the rule, and that\nwhen they learn about the rule, they\nwill post the notice without the need for\nformal administrative action or\nlitigation. 75 FR 80414. To that end,\n\n§ 104.212(a) of the rule states that if an\n\n145 ALFA contends that failure to post a Board-\nrequired notice is not an unfair labor practice, but\nthe authorities cited do not support that\nproposition.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022303",
