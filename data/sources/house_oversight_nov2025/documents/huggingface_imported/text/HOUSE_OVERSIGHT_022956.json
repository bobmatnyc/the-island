  "text": "Then there is the outside world pressed to the glass, appalled and\ntitillated by the monster inside the big house—a kind of Boo Radley of the\nUpper East Side. I have taken friends by the Epstein mansion, and the\nreaction to its other-worldly size in Manhattan is almost always the same: an\nincredulous guffaw. Press accounts, seldom supplying new information, ever\nrecycle and repeat the mysterious (and monstrous) billionaire mythology,\nwith brief glimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same photos\nendlessly republished), and the assumption of depravity inside.\n\nIn fact, the life in the house, without wife or children or conventional\ndomestic demeanor, in some way conforms to the most scripted fantasies: a\nlife somewhere between Daddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut.\n\nThe domesticity of the house, and the background of Epstein’s\nproblems, centers around a group of young women who act as his support\nstaff and companions. Some have worked for him for many years, marrying,\nhaving children, and continuing as part of his business and household\ninfrastructure. One woman, on an afternoon when I was there, recently\nmarried, had just returned from an around the world honeymoon that Epstein\nhad arranged for her. Some are his romantic interests. His present girl friend\nis in dental school. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a Swedish\nmodel and Miss Universe finalist, became a doctor and married hedge\nfunder Glen Dubin and together they finance the Dubin Breast Center at\nMount Sinai Hospital.

It\nsometimes seems part of Epstein’s implicit challenge: not just look at me,\nbut do you dare look at me? Or it seems he is just oblivious to what other’s\nare thinking. A sort of fatal tone deafness.\n\nEpstein’s young women mingle freely with his powerful guests, not so\nmuch as hostess or, in tabloid language, harem-like (or as “sex slaves’’), but\noften as attentive students (that, of course, might be regarded as having its\nown fetish-like attraction).\n\nOnce, Epstein invited me to sit in on a day of presentations to him in\nhis dining room by various “quants.” Quant theory involves making\ninvestments based solely on mathematical and statistical models. This\nmethod can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it\ndoesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of\nsuccessful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage. Epstein’s\neffort was to identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022956",
