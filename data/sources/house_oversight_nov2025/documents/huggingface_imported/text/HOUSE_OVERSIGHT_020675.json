  "text": "Lina Medina, born on 23 September, 1933, was the youngest woman ever to give birth. She did so when she was just 5-\nyears-old. Turns out Lina was born with a rare condition called ‘precocious puberty’, a condition where sexual\ndevelopment happens at an early age. Lina gave birth on May 14, 1939, via a cesarean section, since her pelvis was too\n\nsmall. The child, named Gerardo, was born completely healthy but the father was never found out.\n\n#10 ‘Terezka’s Scrawls’\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020675",
