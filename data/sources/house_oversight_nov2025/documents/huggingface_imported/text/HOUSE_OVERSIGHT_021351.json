  "text": "anthropomorphism to fresh possibilities\nfor interpretation that are especially\nimportant for understanding its role in\nthe human spiritual traditions in\nmodernity, as well as the controversies\nsurrounding that role. This research\nproposes that a single set of\npsychological mechanisms is likely to\nexplain when people perceive a mind at\nwork in an encountered phenomenon,\nregardless of whether the thing in\nquestion is a god, a machine, an animal,\nanother person, or an uncanny sequence\nof events. From this perspective, the\npsychological process of\nanthropomorphic inference works in\nconcert with two other motivational\nmechanisms: the need to interact\neffectively with nonhuman phenomena\nin our environment and the desire to\nestablish social connections with other\nhumans.” The phrase anthropomorphic\ninference fails to capture, however, the\ninteractive dynamism that infuses a\nperson’s perception that a mind is at\nwork in another agent. Put more\nstrongly, our sense that mind is present\nin the other is, in no small measure, the\nsense that we are communicating. The\nabsence of this communicative\ndimension of mind perception is\nprecisely the tragedy in the family of an\nAlzheimer’s patient—the loss of\nreciprocal recognition. As Tanya\nLuhrmann vividly illustrates in the next\nchapter, religious anthropomorphism\nbuilds on the notion that this\ncommunicative reciprocity extends\nbeyond the boundary of human society\ninto the wider environment and includes\nsocial connection and communication\nwith the divine.\n\nAnthropomorphism adds an\nobvious but important twist to these\npsychological mechanisms: whenever a\nperson ascribes human attributes to a\n\nPage |105\n\nnonhuman phenomenon, the person\nnonetheless continues to perceive it as\nnonhuman. When, for instance, a pet\nowner observes a dog’s reliability and\ninfers that this behavior arises from the\ndog’s faithfulness, the owner does not go\non to say that the dog is human. Indeed,\nan indispensable aspect of an\nanthropomorphic way of seeing Fido’s\nfaithfulness is that the person also\ncontinues to see Fido as a dog. This dual\nperception is even more pronounced in a\nparallel illustration: a person observes\nthe everyday reliability of gravity and\ninfers that this arises from faithfulness at\nthe heart of the natural order. Both\nillustrations indicate a close connection\nof anthropomorphism to metaphor, in\nwhich persons understand one kind of\nthing in terms of another by identifying a\nfeature that bridges their difference\nwithout eliminating it. The specific\nfeature, in this case faithfulness, posits a\npoint of comparison that enables a\nfamiliar human capacity for loyalty to\nenable interpretation of another,\nunfamiliar or alien phenomenon. The\nillustrations further suggest that Fido’s\nfaithfulness is what could be called weak\nanthropomorphism, because one could\nplausibly argue that dogs and humans\nactually do share a capacity for\nfaithfulness. We perceive that, as\nmammals, they exhibit many behavioral\nsimilarities. By contrast, the perception\nof faithfulness as an attribute of the\nnatural order is strong\nanthropomorphism, because it makes a\nfar more daring inference in its effort to\ndraw an analogy that produces insight or\nknowledge about the communicative\nreciprocity of the human and the\nnonhuman. Religions, as Edwards’s\nsermon illustrates, build primarily on\nstrong anthropomorphism in order to\npropound communicative social\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021351",
