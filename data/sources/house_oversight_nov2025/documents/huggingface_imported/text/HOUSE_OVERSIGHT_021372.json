  "text": "in accord with what is believed to be\nGod’s intentions for one.\n\nBeliefs like this about God’s\npresence as a constituent feature of\nhuman operations are at times\nincorporated by Christians within an\naccount of creation: God’s presence to\nor within them is then believed to be an\nelement of what God as the creator of\nthe world gives to every human being;\nand is in that sense part of the natural or\nordinary constitution of human life that\nGod intends in creating the world.“ But\nmore often than not the gift of God’s\npresence as an effective influence on\nhuman life is specifically associated by\nChristians with salvation. Human beings,\nChristians typically believe, have either\nlost altogether, or at a minimum,\nhabitually fail to attend properly to a\npresence of God always theirs, in ways\nthat corrupt human well-being. The\nChristian claim is that God saves human\nbeings by giving them the presence of\nGod as an effective force for human\ntransformation in virtue of something\nthat Jesus suffers or accomplishes.\n\nGod acts as an invisible force in\nhuman lives here because God\ninfluences humans through God’s very\npresence. Christians, if they follow the\ncommon teaching of theologians in this\nregard, believe God is invisible or\nunapparent because God is not capable\nof being delimited or circumscribed by\nthe usual boundary drawing and sorting\nmechanisms used to cordon off and pin\ndown other things.“ God is not, in\nshort, a kind of thing, set off by clear\nboundaries that distinguish God from\nwhat God is not. But there is also here\nthe kind of invisibility discussed earlier:\nthe invisibility of apparent absence in\nhuman terms.\n\n126\n\nPage\n\nChristian claims about salvation\noften have an eschatological edge. They\nfrequently point, that is, to an end time,\nindefinitely deferred from the\nperspective of anything achievable in\nthis life. What God gives to remedy the\nsin of human life through Christ is,\naccordingly, not commonly thought to\nbe fully effective in any visible way in\nthis life. Christians typically think that\ntheir connection to Jesus brings with it a\nnew availability of the presence of God\nas a force for change in their lives, but\nwhat they expect to achieve by way of\nthat constantly available relationship\nremains invisible in the form of an\nalways deferred hope. Once again it is\ninvisibility—here the invisibility of the\nrevolutionary changes in one’s life for\nwhich one continues to hope--that\npermits Christians to believe the\npresence of God, made available to them\nin a new way in Christ for the very\npurpose of bringing about those changes,\nis nevertheless always with them.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe main intention of this\nchapter was to make the case that basic\nChristian beliefs are likely to have a\nbearing on perceived social isolation.\nAfter suggesting that Christianity is not\nall of a piece on that score, I developed a\nparticular construal of basic Christian\nbeliefs that would seem to have great\npotential to alleviate perceived social\nisolation through attention to connection\nwith God. While that argument was\nmerely a logical or prima facie one, it\nforms a testable—though as yet\nuntested—hypothesis: Does the\nparticular construal of the beliefs\ncommended here for their\nencouragement of a focal sense of\nconstant connection with God really\nhave those consequences? Do people\nactually feel less lonely, in other words,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021372",
