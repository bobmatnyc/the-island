  "text": "perfectly. No missiles would actually be shot. This stage was for the telemetry.\nOnce that was done, the soldier-actors would be replaced with wooden targets\nand the real munitions would be tested.\n\nThe young soldiers stated chatting to one another, and milling about,\nsimulating as best we could the circumstances in which we expected to target\nSaddam if the operation got final approval. In theory, within a minute, two\nminutes at most, we would get word that the preliminary mock-firing sequence\nhad gone perfectly — at which point the artillery-range targets would be brought\nin for the live test. But suddenly, there was an explosion. A split second of\nsilence. Then pandemonium. There was no need to know, and no time to\nwonder, what exactly had gone wrong, or how it had been allowed to happen. It\nwas obvious to all of us that the /ive missiles had been fired. We sprinted\nforward. When we got to the group of soldiers, we could see that four of the\nyoung men were dead. Another was fighting for his life. Several others were\nalso wounded.\n\nA sayeret medic and several senior officers were trying to save the most\nbadly injured man, but I knew I needed to get military doctors and medical\nevacuation helicopters in immediately if we were to save the lives of the injured\nsoldiers. I had a mobile phone, but couldn’t get a signal. I ran toward a slightly\nhigher area a few dozen yards away and managed to get through to the kirya. I\nissued orders for the nearby training base in Tze’elim and an air force near\nBeersheva to dispatch helicopters to treat and evacuate the wounded.\n\nWe heard the first chopper about 25 minutes later, but it seemed initially\nunable to see us, because it flew on before returning and landing two minutes\nlater. By that time, a medical team from the base in Tze’ elim had arrived. Ten\nminutes later, two other medevac choppers landed. But the soldier who had\nbeen worst wounded could not be saved. After the doctors had been there about\n20 minutes, I again retreated to the area where I could get a mobile signal, and\nphoned Rabin to tell him what had happened. We agreed I should come back to\nbrief him in detail. It was now about 50 minutes since the missiles had hit. The\nwounded were all being treated. One of the helicopters had taken off for\nBeersheva Hospital. Another two, including a heavier Sikorsky transport\nhelicopter, were preparing to leave. I arranged for Amnon, military intelligence\nchief Shmuel Arad and me to return to the kirya. I told Amiram to stay until he\nhad confirmed all the injured had been evacuated, and talk to everyone involved\nto get a preliminary idea of why and how the tragedy had happened.\n\n248\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011719",
