  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n795\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\n§ 1605(a)(7) state sponsor of terrorism\nclaim into a § 1605(a)(5) tort claim.\n\nWith respect to Prince Sultan’s and\nPrince Turki's arguments that the entire\ntort, meaning both the tortious conduct\nand the injury, must occur in the United\nStates, Judge Robertson disagreed and\nstated the FSIA “preserves immunity for\ntort claims unless injury or death occurs in\nthe United States.” Burnett If, 292\nF .Supp.2d at 19 n. 4 (quoting Tel-Oren v.\nInbyan Arab Republic, 726 F.2d 774, 775\n(D.C.Cir.1984)) (Edwards, J., concurring)\n(some emphasis omitted). Courts in the\nSecond Circuit seem to take the opposite\napproach. “Although cast in terms that\nmay be read to require that only the injury\nrather than the tortious acts occur in the\nUnited States, the Supreme Court has\nheld that this exception ‘covers only torts\noccurring within the territorial jurisdiction\nof the United States.” Cabiri v. Govt of\nthe Republic of Ghana, 165 F.3d 198, 200\nn. 3 (2d Cir.1999) (quoting Amerada Hess,\n488 U.S. at 441, 109 S.Ct. 683); see also\nArsh v. State of Israel, 962 F.Supp. 377,\n383-84 (S.D.N.Y.1997) (citing legislative\nhistory stating both the tort and injury\nmust occur within the United States for\nthe exception to apply and dismissing com-\nplaint where plaintiffs failed to allege spe-\ncific tort or place tort occurred); Kline,\n685 F.Supp. at 391 (finding tort exception\ninapplicable where victim was abducted in\nMexico City and brought to the United\n\n25. Judge Robertson recognized the same diffi-\nculty. Although he did consider Plaintiffs’s\nclaims under the tort exception, he found that\nthe language of the state sponsor of terrorism\nexception buttressed his ultimate conclusion\nthat the tortious acts exception would not\nprovide subject matter jurisdiction over\nPrince Sultan and Prince Turki. Unlike\n(a)(7), the tort exception “makes no mention\nof the ‘provision of material support.’”’ Bur-\nnett IT, 292 F.Supp.2d at 20 n. 5. After review-\ning canons of statutory construction counsel-\ning that Congress acts intentionally when it\n\nStates because “the entire tort must be\ncommitted in the United States”).\n\nPlaintiffs allege that the Kingdom,\nPrince Sultan, and Prince Turki tortiously\naided and abetted the September 11 ter-\nrorists by supporting charities that, in\nturn, supported al Qaeda and international\nterrorism. Plaintiffs also claim that, in\nreturn for protection of the Kingdom,\nthese Defendants essentially willfully ig-\nnored the threat that Osama bin Laden\nand al Qaeda posed to the United States.\nPlaintiffs do not claim that the Kingdom or\nthe Princes undertook any of their alleged\nacts in the United States. Yet, in the\nPlaintiffs’ view, the operative torts for the\nCourt’s consideration are the attacks of\nSeptember 11, which did take place in the\nUnited States. See Burnett If, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 19 n. 4 (noting death and\ninjuries occurred in United States). Fur-\nther, Plaintiffs claim it would be unjust to\nallow foreign nations to escape liability for\ntortious acts performed in the United\nStates if they could show that some act of\nplanning the tort took place outside the\nUnited States.\n\nAdditionally, Defendants submit that,\nsince the allegations are precisely those\noutlined in § 1605(a)(7)—that is, “personal\ninjury or death that was caused by an act\nof ... extrajudicial killing, aircraft sabo-\ntage ... or the provision of material sup-\nport or resources ... for such an act?—\nnone of the other exceptions should be\nread to apply in its place.” Defendants\n\nincludes particular language in one section of\na statute but omits it from another, Judge\nRobertson concluded that Congress’s omis-\nsion of ‘provision of material support’ from\n(a)(5) should be treated as intentional. IJd.;\nsee also HCSC-Laundry v. United States, 450\nU.S. 1, 6, 101 S.Ct. 836, 67 L.Ed.2d 1 (1980)\n(per curiam) (“[I]t is a basic principle of\nstatutory construction that a specific statute\n\n. controls over a general provision ...,\nparticularly when the two are interrelated\nand closely positioned.’’).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017860",
