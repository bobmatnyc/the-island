  "text": "12\n\nordinary Syrians. A dialogue of the deaf ensued. The Assads’ intense\npreoccupation with external crises led them to neglect the internal\nscene. Who would need political freedoms, they no doubt thought, if\ngiven the benefits of security and stability? As the regime’s official\ndaily newspaper Tishrin wrote on 25 April: “The most sublime form\nof freedom is the security of the nation.”\n\nThe recent explosion of popular anger has evidently taken Bashar by\nsurprise, as it did other Arab autocrats. He has had to wrench his\nattention away from the perils and excitements of foreign policy to\nurgent challenges at home. To devise and implement far-reaching\ndomestic reforms, as the present situation urgently demands, will\nrequire a radical change of focus. It will not be easy, and a favourable\noutcome is far from certain. Bashar now faces an internal threat to his\nregime at least as dangerous as any of the external threats he and his\nfather confronted so successfully.\n\nPatrick Seale is a leading British writer on the Middle East. His\nlatest book is The Struggle for Arab Independence: Riad el-Solh and\nthe Makers of the Modern Middle East (Cambridge University\nPress).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024969",
