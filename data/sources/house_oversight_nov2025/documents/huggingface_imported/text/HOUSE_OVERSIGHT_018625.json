  "text": "something, or give a little, it makes a tiny bit of difference. Maybe you just have to stay\nopen. Keep trying. These things build up.”\n\n\"You don't understand,” I snapped. \"You don't know him! Maybe he really cares, but\neven if he does, it doesn't matter! Things always end up the same. If I mention emotions,\nor if I act warm to him, he'll ignore me for a while... and then he'll be cold to me again.\nI'm telling you, I've been here before, with Richard. It's a trap.”\n\nMr. Ambition didn't waver. \"If you're strong enough,\" he said simply, \"then you can walk\ninto a trap.”\n\nHis words made my heart crack, my breath catch. Made me feel like I've forgotten\neverything I knew about love.\n\nWhen I was younger, I thought of my emotional strength like water: an embrace that\ncould make someone I loved feel lighter. Water is a slow, eroding force that pulls beauty\nfrom the unexpected. Water makes wood into twisted driftwood sculptures; sharp glass\ninto opaque dim jewels; rocks into soft sand. Water will eventually reveal the heart of\neverything it touches. If you let it.\n\nI hadn't thought of myself that way in a long time. I felt like Mr. Ambition was calling\nme out, reminding me of who I wanted to be. Maybe I protect myself better, these days.\nBut vulnerability is not always a bad thing.\n\nI definitely could fall in love with this man, I realized.\n\"You're really amazing,\" I said, and threw myself on his chest.\nHe put his arms around me. \"So are you,\" he said.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nAs a storyteller, I often look back on my relationships and pick out foreshadowing: the\nomens. And by now, I recognize the omens even as they're happening... and sometimes I\nchange my behavior, but usually I don't. Perhaps this state is what they call maturity.\n\nOne night while we were out, Mr. Ambition sighed in an offhand way. He seemed tired,\nout of sorts. \"I just want someone to take me on an emotional journey,” he remarked to\nme. Then he added, \"... No offense.”\n\nI mentioned this to a friend, later: \"Mr. Ambition says he wants me to take him on an\nemotional journey,” I said.\n\n\"An 'emotional journey’? That shit gets old, though,\" said my friend. I laughed, and\nagreed with him.\n\nAnother night, Mr. Ambition mentioned something about enjoying drama. I was with my\nbest girlfriend at the time; she and I looked at each other. \"Careful what you wish for,\" I\nsaid.\n\nMy friend said, \"Yeah, I'm pretty sure Clarisse knows how to create arbitrary amounts of\ndrama at any time.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018625",
