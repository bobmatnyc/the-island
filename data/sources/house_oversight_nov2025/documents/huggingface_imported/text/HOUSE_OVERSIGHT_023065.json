Just like the headlines of a hotel maid now proven to have lied in the \nStauss Kahn case. The girl who accused Prince Andrew can also easily be proven to be a liar. I think \nBuckingham Palace would love it . You should task someone to investigate the girl , that has \ncaused the Queens son all this agro. I promise you she is a fraud. you and i will be able to go to ascot for the \nrest of our lives. I know there is a public police report that no one has had the coorage to publish, as they do not \nwant to be seen attacking a \" vicitm\", but being falsely accused will be the new headline \nOn Fri, Jul 1, 2011 at 2:43 PM, Peggy Siegal < \n> wrote: \nIf you rewrite your last email in better grammar, (and so I have a better understanding) I can cut and paste and send it to Arianna \nHuffmgton from me \nDid you know why Prince Albert's Charlene fled to the airport with a one way ticket back to South Africa? Because she found out about a \nthird illegitimate child that is 3 months old...the palace officials followed her to the airport and propably made her an offer she could not \nrefuse.. will get details from Jim Coleman when he comes home Sunday night. \nIn Southampton now.

Ariana should champion the dangers of false allegations. send a reporter or reporters to investigate,., the palace would love it, the \ngirl in the photo , was nothing more than a telephone answerer„ she was never 15, according to her version she worked for trump , first at \nthat age, at MAra lago. ITs ridiculous, but the press like strauss kahn is afraid to question women. \n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
