  "text": "Chapter Six:\nWarez Dudes\n\nIn which the Seventh Sense reveals a secret, dangerous architecture of connection.\n1.\n\nIt was my second overseas trip. I blinked my eyes as dawn broke over Europe and\nseeped inside the airplane. We began our descent into Amsterdam. | changed the\ntapes inside my Walkman. Something a bit more upbeat seemed right. Peter Gabriel.\nIt was 1993. August.\n\nEarlier that spring I’d heard about a plan for a giant summer computer hacking\nconference that would be held outside Amsterdam. “Hacking at the End of the\nUniverse” it was to be called. | can’t recall now where | had picked up news of the\ngathering, but it appealed to me immediately. I’d just moved to New York and had\nbeen dipping into the city’s hacking scene. The “scene” was less a boiling, hip hive of\naction than a group of computer amateurs, curious hangers on and early IT system\nengineers who would gather in the grubby basement of the Citicorp Building on 53\"\nStreet and Lexington some days after work to discuss various techniques for\ntricking digital systems of all types. Hacking didn't have a deeply nefarious\nconnotation in those days; it was seen by most of us as a natural, even a healthy\nextension of an interest in computers. The Internet had about 10 million users at the\ntime. The idea that, two decades later, it would connect more than three billion\npeople or that it would put millions of dollars into the pockets of some of the people\ngathering in that basement was honestly unthinkable.\n\nThe bible of the group was a thin, irregularly stapled, photocopied magazine\npublished out on Long Island by a guy who used the nom-de-hack of Emmanuel\nGoldstein, the hero of George Orwell’s novel 1984. The magazine was called “2600:\nThe Hacker Quarterly” and it offered a compilation of ideas about how to fool\naround with systems of all sorts, from Atari gaming consoles to door locks. The\nname “2600” came from one of the earliest hacks any of us at those little meetings\nknew about, a famous 1970’s trick that involved using an audio tone at exactly 2600\nhertz (about the pitch of a truck’s backup warning) to force the backbone routing\nswitches of the AT&T phone system to give up access to an “operator mode” which\nwould let the phone hacker - they were called phreakers - make any sort of call for\nfree. The hack didn’t really offer much practical pleasure except a chance to make\nfree phone calls anywhere in the world. Once you'd mastered the trick you pretty\nquickly discovered there wasn't really anyone in Bombay you wanted to call\nanyhow.\n\nThe real appeal, the deeper joy of the game, was different: It was the sense of secret,\necstatic access. A feeling of control in the largest network on earth. At one pointa\nphreaker named John Draper figured out that the little plastic whistles stuffed as\nchildren’s toys inside boxes of sugary Cap’n Crunch cereal produced the 2600 Hz\ntone nearly perfectly. The hack made him a legend. He became known, inevitably, as\n\n92\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018324",
