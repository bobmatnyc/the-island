  "text": "Epstein summons in the next person cooling his heels in the ante-\nroom. It’s a young man named Brock Pierce, a former child actor, and\ndotcom high flyer—a principle in a gaming company called DEN, a\nnotorious dotcom burnout, with its own sex scandal—who is now a leading\ninvestor in Bitcoin. He describe himself as the “the most active investor in\nthe field.”\n\nAnd, indeed, is the first clear explanation I actually get about Bitcoin.\nIt is so good that Epstein stops him and checks to see if his next appointment\nis here. And seconds later, Larry Summers, the former treasury secretary and\nPresident of Harvard, enters the dining room. Summers, off Diet Coke, digs\ndeep into the Sheikh’s chocolates, focuses in on the Bitcoin investor.\n\n“Okay,” he says, after listening for a bit, “I have opportunities here.\nBut an additional feature of my decision problem roughly speaking is that\nthe worst that could happen to you is that you could lose all the money you\nput into it. Whereas, I could go—I mean I don’t look that great now—but I\ncould go from being seen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence\nto being a figure of much less intelligence and much less probity...”\n\n“Well,” says Pierce in some dramatic understatement, “you are going\nto have some low quality characters playing early in the space...”\n\nThat evening, there is a small cocktail party, which includes the\nformer Prime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and Thorbjern Jaglandthe\nhead of the Noble Peace Prize Committee, who offers an affable, but general\nscathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense of Obama’s Peace\nPrize award) and to whom Epstein offers a ride back to Europe on his jet.\n\nThe next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former Israeli Prime Minister\nand Israel, for breakfast. Barack is, over his omelet, able to defend both\nObama and Putin. Then Kathy Ruemmler, who has just left her job as White\nHouse Counsel joins. She is already in the mix as a possible next attorney\ngeneral, but, in fact, will withdraw from consideration in part to work with\nEpstein. [TK Ruemmler quotes... ]\n\nLarry Summers wife, Elisa New, drops by. She teaches American\npoetry at Harvard and is putting together a proposal for a series on poetry\nthat WGBH in Boston may produce and Epstein is advising on where she\nmight go for added support (he also makes mince meat of her budget).\n\nThere follows the former head of the UN Security Council, Hardeep\nPurie, and then head of the central bank of Kazakhstan, Kairat Kelimbetov.\n\nThen Nathan Myhrvold the former chief technology office at\nMicrosoft. Then Martin Nowak a Professor of Biology and Mathematics and\nDirector of the Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, the institute\nthat Epstein has funded with $30 million. Part of Nowak’s research has to do\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022752",
