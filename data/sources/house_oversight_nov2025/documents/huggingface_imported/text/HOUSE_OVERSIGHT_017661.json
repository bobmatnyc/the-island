  "text": "Page 26 of 78\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *897\n\nThis may be a convenient place to highlight another defect in the Advisory Committee's proposal - crime victims have no right\nto be heard on whether their address should be given to the defendant. As discussed shortly, 7°4 I had originally proposed\nallowing victims to be heard \"on any matter directly affecting a victim's right\" - for example, whether disclosing a victim's\nhome address violates the victim's right to reasonable protection. The Advisory Committee waters down that proposal,\nrecommending only that the victim must \"be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court concerning release,\nplea, or sentencing involving the crime.\" ?°5 Under the Advisory Committee's formulation, therefore, crime victims would\nseem to have no right to be heard on disclosure of their address. This is not a matter concerning \"release, plea, or sentencing\"\nand, in many cases, this issue will be decided by written pleadings rather than in a \"public proceeding.” Nothing better\nillustrates the unfairness of the Advisory Committee's proposals and their illegality under the CVRA than its refusal to\nguarantee that crime victims will be heard on the subject of whether their home address will be turned over to the defendants\naccused of victimizing them.\n\nCompounding all these problems is one more: The Advisory Committee appears to encourage the use of crime victim\ndepositions or other face-to-face meetings between victims and defendants. In its proposed note to the amended rule, the\nAdvisory Committee describes as one possible procedure for dealing with a defense request for a victim's home address that\n\"the court might authorize the defendant and his counsel to meet with the victim in a manner and place designated by the court,\nrather than giving the defendant the name and address of victim.\" 7° This note raises a host of problems. Most importantly, a\nfederal court lacks jurisdiction to require a crime victim to appear at a face-to-face, pretrial [*898] meeting with the defendant.\n\nn 207\n\nThe \"federal courts are courts of limited jurisdiction, and federal judges have no general power to compel private citizens\n\nto meet with defendants before a trial. 2°° Moreover, the Advisory Committee seems to envision that such orders could issue\nwithout the victim even being heard on the subject, a deprivation of liberty without due process of law. 7°?\n\nEven if the court had authority and had considered a victim's arguments, a face-to-face meeting with the defendant raises other\nproblems. Such a meeting is a deposition in all but name. Yet Rule 15 provides stringent limits on the circumstances in which a\ndefendant can depose a victim. In particular, any deposition is limited to \"exceptional circumstances\" and a deposition for\ndiscovery purposes is not permitted. *!° The Advisory Committee Note suggesting a meeting between a victim and a defendant\ndoes an end run around these limitations. *!!\n\nIn light of all these concerns, the best approach is simply to strike the existing requirement that a victim's address and phone\nnumber be turned over as part of an alibi defense, as I proposed. It should also be noted that this proposal raises no due process\nconcerns that might stem from a one-sided reciprocal discovery rule. My proposal applies even handedly to both prosecution\nand the defense. Neither side is required to disclose the address or telephone number of a victim, thus complying with the\nSupreme Court's instruction that \"in the absence of a strong showing of state interests to the contrary, discovery must be a two-\n\n204 See infra notes 528-539 and accompanying text (discussing proposed Rule 60(a)(3)).\n\n205 Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60, at 16.\n\n206 Td. at 6.\n\n207 Rasul v.
