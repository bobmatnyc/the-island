  "text": "Carlo Allegri / Reuters\n\nOver roughly the past month, coverage of Bill Clinton’s travels with financier and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein have made\ntheir way from a thick stack of court documents into something approaching political mythology, propelled by a string of\ninnuendo-laced reports hinting that the former president must have been in some way complicit when he voyaged with a\n\nbillionaire known for preying on underage girls.\n\nIt’s a story with plenty to gape at, from horrific and excruciatingly detailed allegations against Epstein to the frequent presence of\n\na former president who was, after all, nearly chased from office for a (consensual) affair with an intern.\n\nBut sometimes stories that seem too good to be true — just might be. A detailed review by a team of BuzzFeed News reporters of\nmore than 2,000 pages of pleadings, depositions, affidavits, police reports, flight logs, and other documents filed in state and\nfederal court found that many of the most provocative allegations about Clinton have little to no factual foundation and are\nexaggerated at best; that the documents — which appear to be the source for nearly all current reporting on this subject —\nthemselves never suggest that Clinton was doing more than using his wealthy friend as a kind of global taxi service; and that\n\nmany of the most lurid insinuations have been floated without any visible support from verifiable information.\n\nWhile it’s still possible that some Rosetta stone of Clintonian depravity will surface from a pair of ongoing lawsuits involving\nEpstein, the fact that nothing even close to that has been dug up over the course of a half-dozen years of heated litigation should\n\nnot be encouraging for Republican operatives and other Clinton critics hotly anticipating the very worst.\n\nOne sign that the connection is a bit weak: The lawyers who have used the Clinton link to help publicize their cases have been\n\nmarkedly vague on details.\n\nWhen asked to present actual proof, Jack Scarola, the Florida attorney responsible for filing some of the most attention-grabbing\ndocuments that have come to light in recent weeks, warned darkly in an email of “extortionate threats, power, wealth or political\n\npressure.”\n\n“The time will come when all your questions will be answered,” said Scarola, who represents another trial attorney suing Epstein in\n\nPalm Beach County Court. “But that time is not now.”\n\nUnwilling to wait, perhaps, publications on both sides of the Atlantic have gleefully dipped into those documents to publish\nbreathless descriptions of Epstein’s “black book,” which contains a host of Clinton phone numbers (along with just about every\nother powerful figure in the Western world); dissections of handwritten flight logs for the financier’s private 727 aircraft that\nfrequently capture Bubba at 30,000 feet; and extensive allegations from a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was Epstein’s\nsex slave as a teenager and whose recollection places the former commander-in-chief on “Orgy Island” in 2002 to participate in a\n\nsexual romp, possibly with women who were not yet of age.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022697",
