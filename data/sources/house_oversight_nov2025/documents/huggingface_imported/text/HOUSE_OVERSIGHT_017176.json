  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\n2. Fighting Words: Speech that is so offensive to some that it may cause those who hear it\nto react violently. This includes racial or religious epithets hurled at minorities.\n3. Criminogenic speech: Violent sexualized images that may cause, directly or indirectly,\nsuch harms as rape or sexual harassment.\n4. Disclosure of information that may harm the nation or individuals. This includes military\nand diplomatic secrets, and other information that the government or individuals may have\na right to keep from the public. It may also include disclosure of personal information that\nmay embarrass individuals.\n5. Defamatory speech: Expressions that libel, slander or harass others, by conveying false or\nridiculing information about them.\n6. Incitements: Expressions that are calculated to incite others to commit violent or other\nillegal actions.\n7. Disruptions: Expressions that are designed to disrupt speakers or otherwise prevent\nopposing views from being expressed or heard.”®\nThese alleged harms sometimes overlap, as with obscenity which may offend and also cause\nviolence against women, or racist speech which may both offend and provoke violence.\n\nIn the pages to follow, I will recount my experiences—both professional and personal—with each\nof those purported exceptions to the First Amendment. I will describe how the First Amendment\nhas changed over the half century I have been litigating freedom of expression cases. In some\ninstances, these exceptions have been narrowed, while in others they have been expanded. I will\nbegin by exploring the roots and rationality of the “mother” of all exceptions to the First\nAmendment: “Falsely shouting fire in a theater.” This metaphor has been invoked to justify\ncensorship in nearly all of my cases: pornography, revealing state secrets, defamation, ridicule,\nincitement and fighting words. Those advocating censorship generally argue that these exceptions\n“are just like shouting fire in a theater.” It is important, therefore, to consider whether this\nparadigm has a strong enough foundation to support the many exceptions to freedom of\nexpression that purport to rest on it.\n\nShouting Fire: The mother of all exceptions to the First Amendment\n\nJustice Oliver Wendell Holmes’ statement that freedom of speech does not protect someone who\nfalsely shouts “fire” in a theater has been invoked so often, by so many people, in such diverse\ncontexts, that it has become part of our national folk language. It has even appeared —most\nappropriately — in the theater: In Tom Stoppard’s play Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead,\na character shouts at the audience, “Fire!” He then quickly explains: “It’s all right — ’'m\ndemonstrating the misuse of free speech.”\n\nShouting “Fire!” in the theater may well be the only jurisprudential analogy that has assumed the\nstatus of a folk argument. A prominent historian has characterized it as “the most brilliantly\npersuasive expression that ever came from Holmes’ pen.” But in spite of its hallowed\n\nposition in both the jurisprudence of the First Amendment and the arsenal of political discourse, it\nis and always was an inapt analogy, even in the context in which it was originally offered. It has\n\n°8 An additional, quite controversial, mechanism involves the financing of political campaigns. See Citizen’s\nUnited Case [cite]. I have not yet litigated cases in this area.\n\n89\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017176",
