Zawahiri has blasted Hamas for adhering to\nceasefires with Israel, not immediately implementing Islamic law in\nGaza, and otherwise deviating from the pure faith of jihadism.\n\nTo prevent these ideas from eroding its support, Hamas has harshly\nrepressed al Qaeda-inspired jihadists in Gaza, arresting and even\ntorturing some of the individuals linked to these groups, according to\nIsraeli sources. In 2009, one Salafi-jihadist preacher declared Gaza to\nbe an Islamic state; Hamas stormed the mosque that was his base,\nkilling him and over 20 others.\n\nBut the biggest difference is that Hamas is a success while al Qaeda is\na failure. Hamas has gone from a small group overshadowed by Yasir\nArafat's Fatah to a large and powerful organization. Whether we like\nit or not, Hamas is the government of Gaza -- and terrorism helped\nthem get there. And with the fall of Mubarak and the emergence of\nthe Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt as an important political actor\nthere, Hamas may gain influence.

But the group's occasional pragmatism suggests that under\nthe right conditions it can be convinced not to play the spoiler. Such\nan effort may fail and involves many sticks as well as carrots, but a\nsimilar effort with al Qaeda would be a fool's errand.\n\nNetanyahu's government may be dead-set against talking with Hamas,\nbut treating it like al Qaeda and using this as a reason to not negotiate\nwith moderates like Abbas only convinces skeptical Palestinians that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023528",
