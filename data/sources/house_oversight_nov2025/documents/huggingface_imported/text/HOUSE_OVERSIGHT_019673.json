When I asked a former intelligence executive about the ultimate\nsource for the Merkel story, he responded, “If Snowden didn’t give\njournalists this document in Hong Kong, we can assume an inter-\nmediary fed it to Appelbaum to publish in Der Spiegel.” According\nto him, the NSA investigation had determined that Snowden indeed\nhad copied an NSA list of the cell phone numbers of foreign leaders,\nincluding the number of Merkel. This list became the basis of the\nDer Spiegel story.\n\nIt was also clear that Snowden gave credence to the release in Mos-\ncow. He made a major point about the hacking of Merkel’s phone\nin an interview with Wired in 2014. Just about two weeks before\nthe leak, Kucherena said Snowden still had access to the documents.\nClearly, someone had access. But whoever was behind it, the release\nof information about the alleged bugging of Merkel’s phone resulted\nin badly fraying U.S. relations with Germany in the midst of devel-\noping troubles in Ukraine. As it later turned out, according to the\n\n© investigation of the German federal prosecutor, which concluded in ©\n2015, there was no evidence found in this document, or elsewhere,\nthat Merkel’s calls were ever actually intercepted. Although they\nrevealed little if anything that the intelligence services of Germany,\nFrance, and Israel were not already aware of, they raised a public\noutcry in allies against NSA surveillance, and the outcry became the\nevent itself.\n\nWhile these post-Hong Kong documents had little if any intel-\nligence value, they provided further evidence that at least part of\nthe stolen NSA documents was in the hands of a party hostile to the\nUnited States. If so, it wasn’t much of a leap to assume that this party\nalso had access to the far more valuable Level 3 documents revealing\nthe NSA’s sources and methods, such as the one that Ledgett had\ndescribed as a “roadmap” to U.S. electronic espionage against Russia\nand China.\n\nWithin the intelligence community, this concern was heightened\nby new countermeasures to this espionage employed by Russia and\nChina after Snowden reached Moscow. For example, there were\nindications that the NSA had lost part of its capabilities to follow\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 185 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019673",
