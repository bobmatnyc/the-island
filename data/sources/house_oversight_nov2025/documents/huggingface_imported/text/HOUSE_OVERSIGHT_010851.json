SIMPSON: I will take your objection to\n\nthe form.\n\nCan we have the question back?\n\n(Thereupon, a portion of the record was read\n\nby the reporter.)\n\nMR, SCAROLA: And I object. The question is\n\nvague and ambiguous because it fails to identify\nthe time period about which you are inquiring.\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Mr. Cassell, as you sit here today, are you\nprepared, based on the information you have available to\nyou, to assert that Professor Dershowitz intentionally\nprovided misleading or doctored documents to a\nprosecuting authority?\n\nA. So based on all the information I have today?\n\nQ. Yes.\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. What do you base -- what is the basis for\nthat conclusion, and include information up until today?\n\nA. All right. So, obviously, that's an\nopen-ended question.\n\nQ.  1-- just answer the question, please, as\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n193\nbest you can.\n\nA. Sure. Allright. Well, let me just --\nthat's a lot -- there's a lot of things to get into on\nthat.\n\nLet's start with the events of the last two\ndays, the deposition of Mr. Dershowitz, which in my mind\ndemonstrates repeated false statements that were made by\nMr, Dershowitz.\n\nLet's begin with the overarching point about\nthe deposition of the last two days. I've been\npracticing law -- law since about 1986. And in my\nexperience, I have never seen a more evasive effort to\navoid answering questions, and to essentially run out\nthe clack so that detailed questions could not be asked\nby my attorney. And I witnessed over the last two days,\nMr. Dershowitz was asked a series of very simple\nquestions; where were you on this day; or what's the\nname; or what time, things like that, and instead of,\nyou know, giving an -- an immediate answer, he ended up\ngiving a very extended answer commonly punctuated with\ndisparaging remarks that seemed to have nothing to do\nwith answering the question.\n\nSo I drew the inference from that that\nMr. Dershowitz did not want to answer questions over the\nlast two days.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\n00:42:08\n\n90:42:10\n\n00:42:14\n\n00:42:17\n\n00:42:19\n\n00:42:22\n\n00:42:25\n\n00:42:27\n\n00:42:30\n\n00:42:31\n\n00:42:32\n\n00:42:33\n\n00:42:34\n\n00:42:34\n\n00:42:35\n\n00:42:37\n\n00:42:39\n\n00:42:43\n\n00:42:44\n\n00:42:43\n\n00:42:50\n\n00:42:51\n\n00:42:51\n\n00:42:54\n\n00:42:54\n\n00:42:55\n\n90:42:56\n\n00:43:00\n\n90:43:02\n\n00:43:05\n\n00:43:07\n\n00:43:09\n\n00:43:10\n\n00:43:10\n\n00:43:13\n\n00:43:13\n\n90:43:15\n\n00:43:18\n\n00:43:21\n\n00:43:24\n\n00:43:27\n\n00:43:28\n\n00:43:31\n\n00:43:34\n\n00:43:37\n\n00:43:38\n\n00:43:41\n\n00:43:44\n\n00:43:48\n\n00:43:52\n\nON OO kh O&O DH\n\n9\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\noOo ON OO hk WO RH =\n\n10\n11\n12\n13\n14\n15\n16\n17\n18\n19\n20\n21\n22\n23\n24\n25\n\n194\nAnother thing that happened during the\ndeposition, and I will not repeat what was said inthe\ndeposition, because there was immediately an objection\nfrom Ms. McCawley, but there were two points in the\n\ndeposition where Mr, Dershowitz made representations\n\nabout what a New York Attorney David Boies would say,\nand I'm not going into any --\n\nQ.  1-- I just want to say if he starts talking\nabout it --\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: No, I -- I object to any\nreference --\n\nMR, SIMPSON: -- then I get to ask all the\nquestions if he should say anything.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: I think he's just\nacknowledging that -- I’m sorry. I think he’s\nacknowledging that that occurred. I object to\nany -- any discussion of any settlement\ncommunications in the context of that privilege.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: I don't intend to get into any\nsettlement discussions. We are not going to\nrepeat the substance of the objected-to\ntestimony.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: My point, I just want it to be\non notice --\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Yes.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n195\n\nMR. SIMPSON: -- is if this witness starts\nsaying anything about his communications or why\nhe -- he's coming to a conclusion, he's putting\nthat forth as a basis, he has opened the door.\n\nYou can't put it forth and park and not let\nme ask for all the discussions.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: You can -- you can proceed and\nyou know not to include privileged --\n\nTHE WITNESS: Yes.\n\nMR. SCAROLA: -- cornmunications.\n\nTHE WITNESS: There was a newspaper that\nreported -- a Florida business newspaper that\npromptly after Mr. Dershowitz said that Mr. Boies\nhad made certain representations, a Florida --\nrespected Florida business newspaper immediately\nreported that David Boies had said, that was a\nfalse statement.\n\nAnd In light of that, I now had David Boies\nsaying that Mr. Dershowitz was making false\nstatements under oath during the -- the\ndeposition that occurred over the last two days.\n\nIn addition to that, I had -- again, during\nthe deposition, I heard Mr. Dershowitz say that\nAttorney Bob Josefsberg had said that -- words to\nthe effect that he, Josefsberg, did not believe\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\nPage 192 to 195 of 335\n\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010851",
