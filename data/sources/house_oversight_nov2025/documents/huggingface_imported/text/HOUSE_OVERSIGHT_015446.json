  "text": "“We better run,” | told Marilee.\n“Why? They’ re not gonna hit us.”\n“Yes, they are! Run! Hurry!”\n\nThe police had been let out of their cage and they were absolutely\nenraged. Marilee got away, but | was struck with a nightstick on the\noutside of my right knee. | fell to the ground. The cop ran off to injure as\nmany other cockroaches in his kitchen as he could. Another cop came\ncharging and he yelled at me, “Get up/ Get up!”\n\n‘l’ m trying to!”\n\nHe made a threatening gesture with his billy club, and when | tried\nto protect my head with my arms, he jabbed me viciously on the exposed\nright side of my ribs. Oh, God, the pain! The cops were running amuck\nnow, in an orgy of indiscriminate sadism, swinging their clubs wildly and\nscreaming, “Get the fuck outa here you fuckin’ faggots, you\nmotherfuckin’ cocksuckers!”\n\n| managed to drag myself along the sidewalk. It felt like an electric\ncattle prod was stuck between my ribs. Marilee drove me to a hospital\nemergency ward. X-rays indicated that | had a fractured rib and a\n\npunctured lung.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015446",
