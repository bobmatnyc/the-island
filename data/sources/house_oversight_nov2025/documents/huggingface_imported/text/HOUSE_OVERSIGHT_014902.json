Our 5.5x AWS multiple is a modest\npremium to the software/SaaS comp group at 5.0x on 2018 sales, and 0.9x multiple is a\npremium to a retail general merchandise comp group at 0.7x. We think the premiums are\nwarranted given share gains and superior growth. Our $1,100 price objective implies\n2.8x 2018E Price/Sales, a multiple above the high end of Amazon's historical range of\n1.0-2.5x. We argue the historical P/S multiple should increase given positive 3rd party\nsales (3P) that is reported on a net basis, a higher AWS revenue contribution, an\nincreasing advertising contribution, and record gross profit margins.\n\n; ; BankofAmerica <2”\n16 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014902",
