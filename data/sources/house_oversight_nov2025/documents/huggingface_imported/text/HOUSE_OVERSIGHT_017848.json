Thus, “on a ‘challenge to the dis-\ntrict court’s subject matter jurisdiction, the\ncourt may resolve disputed jurisdictional\nfact issues by reference to evidence out-\nside the pleadings, such as affidavits. ”\nFiletech, 157 F.3d at 932 (explaining a\ncourt should consider all the submissions\nof the parties and may, if necessary, hold\nan evidentiary hearing to resolve the juris-\ndictional question) (quoting Antares Avr-\ncraft, L.P. v. Federal Republic of Nigeria,\n948 F.2d 90, 96 (2d Cir.1991)). The court\nmust consult outside evidence if resolution\nof a proffered factual issue may result in\nthe dismissal of the complaint for lack of\njurisdiction. Robinson, 269 F.3d at 141 n.\n6. Defendants here challenge both the le-\ngal and factual sufficiency of Plaintiffs’\nclaims. The Court will consider the affida-\nvits submitted by the parties as necessary.\n\n[8] Before turning to the allegations\nagainst the Defendants claiming immunity,\nthe Court notes it is keenly aware of the\n“delicate balancle] ‘between permitting\ndiscovery to substantiate exceptions to\nstatutory foreign sovereign immunity and\nprotecting a sovereign’s or sovereign’s\nagency’s legitimate claim to immunity from\ndiscovery.” First City, Texas—Houston,\nN.A. v. Rafidain Bank, 150 F.3d 172, 176\n(2d Cir.1998) (ordering full discovery\nagainst defendant over whom court al-\nready had subject matter jurisdiction be-\ncause such discovery would provide plain-\ntiff an opportunity to obtain jurisdictional\ndiscovery regarding potentially sovereign\nalter ego co-defendant without further im-\npinging that defendant’s immunity) (quot-\ning Arriba Ltd. v. Petroleos Mexicanos,\n962 F.2d 528, 534 (th Cir.1992) (“At the\nvery least, discovery should be ordered\n\ncircumspectly and only to verify allega-\ntions of specific facts crucial to an immuni-\nty determination.”)). The Second Circuit\nhas instructed “that generally a plaintiff\nmay be allowed limited discovery with re-\nspect to the jurisdictional issue; but until\n[plaintiff] has shown a reasonable basis for\nassuming jurisdiction, she is not entitled to\nany other discovery.” First City, 150 F.3d\nat 176-77 (quoting Filus v. Lot Polish\nAirlines, 907 F.2d 1328, 138382 (2d Cir.\n1990)). Still, the Plaintiffs must allege\nsufficient facts to warrant jurisdictional\ndiscovery. Robinson, 269 F.3d at 146 (it-\ning Jazini v. Nissan Motor Co., 148 F.3d\n181, 185 @d Cir.1998) @efusing jurisdic-\ntional discovery where plaintiffs’ allega-\ntions lacked factual specificity to confer\njurisdiction)); see also Burnett If, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 15 (denying Plaintiffs’ re-\nquest for discovery from Prince Turki\nwhere “suggestions of [his] individual ac-\ntivity are only conclusory”).\n\nB.
