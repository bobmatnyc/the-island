  "text": "usually very reluctant to give up.) But\npart and parcel of the account of creation\nis the suggestion that God ordinarily\ninfluences human life by bringing about\nthe very natural and human influences\nthat shape it. In general, because God\ninfluences the world as its creator, God’s\nworking does not begin where created\ncauses break off; God works, instead, in\nand through the created causes that God\nbrings about. Christians are therefore\nable to give a double account of most\nhappenings in the world: one that\ndiscusses what has happened in terms of\nthe coordinated created powers and\nactivities sufficient to explain it within\nthe created order; and one that talks\nabout God’s creative activity in bringing\nabout those same coordinated created\npowers, activities, and their\nconsequences in their totality. It is the\nsufficiency of the explanation in terms of\ncreated causes—the self-containment of\nthat explanation within its own order—\nthat allows human beings to attend to the\ncreated order without taking into account\nthe relationship of dependence upon God\nthat is its presupposition.\n\nThe temptation to lapse into\nhabitual obliviousness of one’s\nrelationship with God is easily\ncountered, however, by other beliefs\nabout God that Christians hold.\nChristians do not just believe that God is\nthe creator and sustainer of the universe,\nbut believe a lot of other things about\nGod. For example, the common\nChristian belief that God acts as more\nthan a creator in individual lives helps to\ncounter obliviousness to God. God does\nnot merely act as creator by giving\nindividuals the created gifts that make\nthem what they are—for example, their\nown capacities and operations, the\nability to influence and be influenced by\ntheir human and natural environments,\n\n125\n\nPage\n\nand so on. God also acts to give them\nGod’s very presence—by way, for\nexample, of their relationship with Christ\nwho Christians believe is God in human\nflesh. The very presence of God in\nhuman life means one’s relationship\nwith God cannot be ignored. The created\ncauses and influences, through which\nGod also influences human life,\nconsequently no longer have the same\ncapacity to distract human attention from\nGod.\n\nChristians often believe,\nmoreover, that God’s direction of human\nlife by way of God’s own presence to or\nwithin it is no optional matter: God’s\npresence forms an essential component\nof human life. In addition to created\ncapacities and influences brought about\nby God, God’s presence is necessary for\nordinary human capacities to operate as\nthey should.“ To be morally good, for\nexample, requires not just virtuous\ncapacities of one’s own, given to one by\nGod, but the presence of the Holy Spirit\nwithin one. Knowing well requires not\njust the formation of good ideas through\nthe usual human processes of\ninvestigating one’s environment—the\nentirety of which has its source in a good\ncreator God--but also a mind informed\nby the very Word of God. And so on.\n\nSuch beliefs imply that attention\nto God’s presence, some sort of God-\ndirectedness, should be a constant\nfeature of an individual’s everyday,\nordinary life, in order for that life to be\nlived well. The individual Christian is\naccordingly given a reason to bring to\nmind his or her relationship with God,\nmotivated to attend to that relationship\nas much as possible, indeed, in the effort\nto lead a better life. An active God-\nreference becomes part of a prospective,\ngoal-oriented process of self-reformation\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021371",
