The impulses split and form two distinct paths, one through the\ncerebral cortex, which gives us the sensation of conscious vision, and the\nother into the lower brain which provides us with instinctive reactions.\n\nThe right hand side of your body is connected to the left hemisphere\nof the brain and vice versa. This means each hand is controlled by the\nopposite side of the brain. But, your eyes see both your hands. To resolve\nthis conundrum a very complex thing has to happen to the optic nerve in\nthe center of the brain. The optic nerve from each eye splits and crosses\nover in the middle, so the left side of the left eye and the left side of the\nright eye goes to the right hand side of the brain and vice versa. This\nkeeps the brain focused on the correct hand.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015799",
