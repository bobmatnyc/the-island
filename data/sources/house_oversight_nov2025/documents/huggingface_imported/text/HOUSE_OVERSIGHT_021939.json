So I was, frankly\nagain, just speaking for myself, I'm not speaking\nfor my co-counsel, but I was extremely afraid of\ntipping off Mr. Dershowitz that we were going to\nbe filing this pleading because he would have\ncontacted Epstein in the same intimidation\ntactics and, indeed, life-threatening tactics\nthat had apparently been used against other\nwitnesses might be used against her.\n\nI mean, I also was thinking frankly, about\nwhether to file this pleading, because of the\nrisk that she would be in, but I thought that the\nsafest way to protect her was to file this so\n\nthat the information was out there.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021939",
