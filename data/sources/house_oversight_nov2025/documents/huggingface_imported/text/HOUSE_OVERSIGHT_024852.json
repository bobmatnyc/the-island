Similar to most other verticals, Mary's topicals fall into the\nsuper-premium segment, which we define as anything above $0.54 per mg of CBD. Of all\nthe SKUs analyzed, the premium segment looks to be the narrowest, while mainstream\nand value segments are the most popular price point among the competitive set.\n\nFigure 51 Popularity in Topicals Are Reflected In The Overall Number Of Brands Playing Within The Segment\n\n$0.80 $0.74\n\n$0.70 $0.62$0.61$0.60\nae $0.45\n$0.40\n$0.30\n$0.20\n$0.10\n$0.00\n\nSagely Naturals\nCuraleaf Hemp\nKush Queen\n\na\n©\n=\n\n2\nr=]\n\n‘=\n=]\n5\n\n=\nwv\n\n>\n=\n6\n=\n\nSuper Premium\n\n(> $0.54)\n\n$0.40\n\n$0.32$0.32¢9 30\n\nMazz Hanna\n\nRX CannaCare\n\nCBD Topicals by Price Segment\n\n0.26$0.25\n: : . £650.19 175\nS 1750. 0.16$0.15 $\nS S ‘ : , 0.1250.11$0 10$0 10s0 085\n25 235 2350.22 Sc 5$0.14 5 e : 0.0 $0.05$0.0550.\n\nMary's Medicinals\nGreen Roads\nHemp Bombs\n\nHighline\n\nLEEF Organics\nMedix CBD\nCanna Hemp X\nBee's Knees\nWildflower\nPure Kana\nCanna Hemp\nPremium Jane\nTry the CBD\nGreen Mountain\n\nMain\n($0.21-50.38)\n\nSource: Company Websites and Cowen and Company\n\nNote: Reflects price per mg of CBD; For companies with multiple SKUs, we used a straight line average\n\nAccording to our proprietary Cowen consumer survey, of respondents who use CBD,\n26.2% of people use topicals as a form factor, which is the highest level seen after\ntinctures. Usage among men and women look to be similar, though younger, lower\nincome use looks to be more prevalent when benchmarking to older, higher income\ncohorts. Similar to capsules, this could reflect the large number of brands we see playing\nin the value segment.\n\nFigure 52 Topical Use Is More Prevalent Among Younger, Lower Income Consumers\n\n35.0%\n\n30.0% 26.2% 26.5%\n\n25.0%\n20.0%\n15.0%\n10.0%\n5.0%\n0.0%\n\nMale\n\nGender\n\nCBD Topical Use\n\n30.1%\n° 27.8%, 29.3%\n\n25.8%\n\nFemale <S50K S$50K-$100K >$ 100K\n\nIncome\n\nSource: Cowen Survey, N=~2500, January 2019\n\n36\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024852",
