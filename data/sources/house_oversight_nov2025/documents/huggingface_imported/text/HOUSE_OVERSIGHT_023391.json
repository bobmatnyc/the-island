  "text": "In re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001., 2012 WL 257568 (2012)\n\n“facilitated financial transactions for, and advertised, maintained and serviced accounts on behalf of, several of al Qaeda’s\nknown charity fronts, including Al Haramain ..., [IRO,] and [MWL].” JA4331. One such company that DMI Trust is alleged\nto have exercised “direct involvement” over is Faisal Islamic Bank of the Sudan. JA4331. Through this company and others,\nDMI Trust is alleged to have “entered into business partnerships with prominent al Qaeda supporters, such as the National\nIslamic Front, the fundamentalist regime which has ruled Sudan since 1989 and provided safe haven to Osama bin Laden and\nal Qaeda from 1991 through 1996.” JA4331. Specifically, Faisal Islamic Bank, and thus DMI Trust, is alleged to have\nprovided loans and other support to the National Islamic Front and its prominent members. JA4332-33. Faisal Islamic Bank\nis also alleged to *89 have “actively participated in the collection of funds for certain of al Qaeda’s ‘charitable’ front\norganizations.” JA4337-38.\n\nAnother “wholly owned subsidiary, Faisal Finance,” is alleged to have “knowingly and intentionally” held and managed\naccounts for multiple al-Qaeda operatives, including Wa’el Julaidan and Yasin Al Kadi, who were both designated by the\nU.S. Department of Treasury as Specially Designated Global Terrorists. JA3723. Plaintiffs allege that in 1998, Al Kadi’s\naccount was identified by “the FBI’s Counter Terrorism Task Force ... as being a source of funding for Hamas terrorist,\nMohamed Saleh” and it “was one of the accounts frozen after September 11, 2001.” JA3823-24. Moreover, under DMI\nTrust’s control, Faisal Finance continued to provide these services even after Osama bin Laden publicly acknowledged his\nclose ties to Julaidan in 1999. JA3723. Similarly, Tadamon Bank, another DMI Trust subsidiary, has “knowingly and\nintentionally lent repeated material support to Al Qaeda through” the provision of “financial and bank account services to\nseveral Al Qaeda operatives.” JA1789-90, 4335, 5915.\n\n*90 3. The District Court Failed to Draw Reasonable Inferences From Plaintiffs’ Extensive Additional Pleadings\nEstablishing Defendants’ Knowing and Reckless Support of Terrorism.\n\nFurther, plaintiffs presented extensive additional allegations that permitted -- indeed, compelled -- reasonable inferences that\neach defendant knew or recklessly disregarded whether the recipients of their funds and services were in fact advancing\nal-Qaeda’s efforts. Far from applying the rule that a court must draw “all reasonable inferences” in favor of the plaintiff when\nresolving a motion to dismiss, Matson v. Bd. of Educ. of the City Sch. Dist. of N.Y., 631 F.3d 57, 72 (2d Cir. 2011), the\ndistrict court declined to draw even the most straightforward inferences about mental state from the extensive allegations of\ndefendants’ actions directed toward al-Qaeda and its closest supporters. Plaintiffs’ allegations, taken as a whole, place\ndefendants at the core of the network that supported al-Qaeda, including through direct provision of funds and services to\nal-Qaeda itself; extensive dealings with the most notorious and widely known charities, related organizations, and individuals\nwho are prominently involved in global jihad and supporting al-Qaeda; and a pattern of dealing with and assisting the persons\nand entities most closely associated with al-Qaeda. An inference of mental state is almost always derived from *91\ncircumstantial evidence, and here that evidence pervasively and consistently points to the conclusion that defendants knew\nthat their support advanced the efforts of al-Qaeda. Alternatively, at a minimum, plaintiffs’ allegations establish that only a\nperson deliberately oblivious to the nature of the parties involved, which is the essence of recklessness, could have failed to\nunderstand that the alleged actions were supporting terrorism.\n\n(a) Reasonable inference based on provision of support to al-Qaeda, a notorious terrorist organization.\n\nThe defendants are alleged to have “provided critical financial and logistical support to al Qaeda in relation to that terrorist\norganization’s global jihad.” JA3834, 3843-44, 3870, 4314, 4331. Defendants’ provision of material support to al-Qaeda\ncame at a time when that terrorist organization was publicly, even notoriously, known to have declared its intent to “wage\nwar with the United States.” JA3153, 3777. Moreover, al-Qaeda had taken credit for numerous terrorist attacks that were\namong the most highly publicized on the planet. As the district court noted, the terrorist organization had “publicly\nacknowledged responsibility for, such terrorist schemes as the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the 1998 attack of\nthe U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, and the 2000 attack of *92 the U.S.S. Cole in Yemen.” SPA20, 50 (Terrorist\nAttacks I) (quotation marks and citations omitted). In addition, President Bill Clinton signed an Executive Order on August\n21, 1998, that “block[ed] the assets of Osama bin Laden and his terrorist cells, including Al Qaeda, as international\nterrorists.” JA1065-66.\n\nWESTLAW\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023391",
