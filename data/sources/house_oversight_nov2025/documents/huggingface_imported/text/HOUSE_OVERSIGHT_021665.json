Federal prosecu-\ntors ended up striking an extraor\ndinary deal with Epstein and his\ntop-flight lawyers: agreeing to recall\ngrand jury subpoenas if Epstein\npleaded guilty to prostitution-\nrelated felonies in state court, which\nhe ultimately did.\n\nEpstein received an 18-month jail\nsentence. He served 13 months and\nwas allowed to leave the jail most\nwaking hours of the day.\n\nAn attorney for Rodriguez, Assis-\n\ntant Federal Public Defender Dave\nBrannon, declined to comment on\nhis behalf.\n\nAn unnamed government witness\nmentioned in the affidavit is likely\none of the attorneys representing\nwomen in a gagele of current civil\nlawsuits against Epstein.\n\nThe affidavit outlines how the\nunnamed witness had deposed\nRodriguez, who denied having docu-\nments, then received a call from\n\nRodriguez later offering to sell for —\n\n$50,000 the “Holy Grail.”\n\n“Rodriguez explained that the\ninformation contained hundreds of —\n\nadditional victims and their phone\nnumbers from diverse geographic\nlocations including New York, New\nMexico and Paris,” according to the\naffidavit.\n\nRodriguez is scheduled to be ar\nraigned in federal court Monday.\n\nAlso in the affidavit are the\nreasons Rodriguez cited to the un-\nnamed witness for why he withheld\nthe lists from investigators: He con-\nsidered it his property and should\nbe compensated for it, and he feared\nthe target of the federal investiga-\ntion, Epstein, would make him dis-\nappear or otherwise harm him.\n© susan_spenccr_wendel phoact com\n\n3/E-Wyf-] DF hadi 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021665",
