That\n$6,872 equals ~19% of annual per-capita income for Americans.\n\n— Medicare: 45 million elderly Americans (15% of population) averaged $7,991\nper person for healthcare in 2008 ($4,875 for hospital care; $3,116 for medical\ninsurance and prescription drugs). That equals ~23% of annual per capita\nincome.\n\n— Private Market: 157mm Americans with private health coverage (subsidized\nby employers) in 2008 paid just 16% of the total premium cost themselves for\nsingle coverage and 27% for family coverage. In effect, that represented tax-\nfree “earnings” of $3,951 for singles or $9,256 for families (not including the\ntax savings on their personal premium contributions).\n\nSource: Department of Health & Human Services, Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services.\n(@)E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 295\n\nRestructure Medicare & Medicaid: Economic Factors—\n\nHealthcare Providers Are Rewarded for Driving Revenue\n\n¢ While striving to provide the best care possible, healthcare\nproviders tend to have financial / legal / societal incentives to\nprovide more care, all else equal.\n\n¢« Reimbursement for providers is generally volume-based (e.g., more\nprocedures generate more revenue for care providers), though there\nare efforts to increasingly focus on quality.\n\nUnlike car buyers, for example, who often disregard a dealer’s\nmaxed-out model and choose only the features that are important to\nthem and what they can afford, healthcare buyers tend to buy all the\n“features” as: 1) buyers (patients in this case) are typically not\nmedical experts, so they defer to doctors / care providers for\ndecisions; and 2) buyers only bear a small portion of the costs as\nsomeone else (employer or government) is paying for the features.\n\nKP\nwww.kpcb.com USA Inc. | What Might a Turnaround Expert Consider? 296\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020989",
