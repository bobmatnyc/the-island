Peter is best for currency; maybe Reid Hoffman (fatty at LinkedIn) or Dave\nMorin (Path) or Drew Houston (Dropbox).\n\nI do believe China offers the best opportunities for Sinofsky. Problem is after Windows, pretty much everything\nelse in the US is a step down. No-one else is building an OS. Alibaba or Xiaomi in China are. But if he wants to\nstay in the US, then probably the best options are Facebook (who may one day do their own OS), Palantir (Peter\nThiel's), Yahoo (where Marissa is aggressively seeking out senior talent). Then of course, there is Apple and\nGoogle - but I assume he doesn't want to be a traitor to Microsoft?\n\nOn 7 Sep 2012, at 03:20, Jeffrey Epstein wrote:\n\nyes, who else ,? im meeting with sinofsky, , i think he wants to do different things. chinese may be\ndifficult becuase of us secuirty cleraence\n\nOn Thu, Sep 6, 2012 at 10:00 PM, Ian Osborne Po wrote:\n\nAre you back now in NY?\n\nI'm in London but staying up to watch the Obama speech.
