  "text": "Matthew's parents Henry \"Bud\" Horton and Sue Popovich Horton who helped secure her a position at\nIBM upon her graduation from GMU. Both of these latter individuals (Bud and Sue Horton) were\ninvolved in the 2007 murder of my son, and they in collusion with their son Matthew continue in the\nexploitation of children Anjulee and Xian Gunther. The powers that be intend now for these children to\n(continue to) follow in the footsteps of Ms. Simms, and to that end, | would advise that you become\nacquainted with (1) the ways in which Ms. Simms subsidized her law school education and off course\n(2) her current and related endeavors especially as they relate to drug trafficking and terror financing\n(see below email to Mr. Martin of the St. Augustine Record).\n\nOn Friday, June 23, 2017 8:36 AM, [is wrote:\n\nMr. Martin,\nSt. Augustine Record\n\nQuite an interesting article about the litigation between Deputy Banks and Rusty Rogers (see:\nDeputy Banks’ attorney claims FDLE agent’s credibility ‘destroyed’) It must also be explored, of\ncourse, that Officers Rodgers was once well respected for his investigation and exposure of a terrorist\nfinancing network that permeated the sunny state of Florida - (the NY Times reports) \"Agent Rodgers\njoined the state’s elite investigative unit, the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, where he\nquickly earned agent-of-the-year honors — and a meeting with the governor — for helping dismantle\na terrorist financing network that stretched from Florida to the Middle East\" - and that terrorism is very\nmuch a well-protected U.S. industry (see below).\n\nGod forbid some poor should get away with disrupting the delicate state of secreted operations; as\nyou yourself report, \"As written in [Plaintiff Banks'] motion: “Defendant Rodgers’ false, misleading and\ninconsistent testimony throughout the discovery process is so pervasive and extreme, and involves\nso many material issues, it has destroyed Defendant's credibility on all issues...\" And here we see the\n\"whole-of-government\" attempts to restore balance.\n\n*\n\nAs for the second Secret Service agent interviewed by the IBM Center for the Business of\nGovernment, his name is Dana Brown. He just so happened to have filled out his career with the\nFederal Air Marshall Service (October 2003-August 2008 as Director/Chief of Staff) followed by the\nTSA (March 2006-January 2009 as Asst. Administrator-Law Enforcement/Integrity Officer) states his\nLinkedIn profile. That he worked his way around to that which was largely put in place by the 1970\n9/11 mini-event seems to me rather significant although | don't see all the details yet. | also don't yet\nsee exactly who it was that birthed this lengthy 9/11 initiative we're suffering. It seems clear, however,\nthat it was birthed prior to 1970.\n\nThe initiative has adjusted in some ways over time, but homage to 9/11 remains strong. Certain of the\npeople deeply involved in these manipulations thought it was kismet that an individual well-suited to\nhead the newly ordained Department of Homeland Security (that as we all Know was the result of\nlegislation rushed through Congress in the aftermath of the 9/11 (2001) attack) was born on the\nmagical September 11th (this is Jeh Johnson); similarly, it is again being deemed a sign that the new\nDirector of the National Science Foundation (NSF) (chosen and positioned as she was) is first-named\nFrance (last name Cordova) and that this name so perfectly relates to US intentions to use the NSF\nto forward \"ops\" that will solidify a US-France working relationship in the same way the 2005 London\nBombings helped solidify the US-British working relationship. These France going-ons are in higher\ngear (I've noticed) since Macron was elected but it was prepped for long ago. | was working for IBM\nunder IBM project manager Cathie Skoog at the NSF when my third trimester pregnancy was\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015009",
