  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54023\n\nexercising one right and not the other\nwould upset the balanced recitation of\nrights. If employees have questions\nconcerning how they can exercise their\nrights, the notice encourages them to\ncontact the Board.\n\nThe Board has also determined that\nthe addition of Beck rights in the final\nnotice is unnecessary. Those rights\napply only to employees who are\nrepresented by unions under collective-\nbargaining agreements containing\nunion-security provisions. As stated in\nthe NPRM, unions that seek to obligate\nemployees to pay dues and fees under\nthose provisions are required to inform\nthose employees of their Beck rights.\nSee California Saw & Knife Works,\nabove, 320 NLRB at 233. See 75 FR at\n80412-80413. The Board was presented\nwith no evidence during this\nrulemaking that suggests that unions are\nnot generally complying with their\nnotice obligations. In addition, the\nNotice of Election, which is posted days\nbefore employees vote on whether to be\nrepresented by a union, contains an\nexplanation of Beck rights. Moreover, as\nthe Board stated in the NPRM, only\nabout 8 percent of all private sector\nemployees are represented by unions,\nand by no means are all of them subject\nto union-security clauses. Accordingly,\nthe number of employees to whom Beck\napplies is significantly smaller than the\nnumber of employees in the private\nsector covered by the NLRA. Id. at\n80413. Indeed, in the “‘right-to-work’”’\nstates, where union-security clauses are\nprohibited, no employees are covered by\nunion security clauses, with the\npossible exception of employees who\nwork in a Federal enclave where state\nlaws do not apply. Accordingly, because\nBeck does not apply to the\noverwhelming majority of employees in\ntoday’s private sector workplace, and\nbecause unions already are obliged to\ninform the employees to whom it does\napply of their Beck rights, the Board is\nnot including Beck notification in the\nfinal notice.\n\nThe Board also disagrees with the\ncomment from Baker & McKenzie\ncontending that an exhaustive list of\nadditional rights should be included in\nthe notice. In addition to the reasons\ndiscussed above, the Board finds that it\nwould not be appropriate to include\nthose rights, most of which are rights of\nunion members vis-a-vis their unions.\nFor example, the comment suggests\nincluding the “right for each union\nmember to insist that his/her dues and\ninitiation fees not be increased * * *\nexcept by a majority vote by secret\nballot * * *,” the ‘‘right of each\nemployee in a bargaining unit to receive\na copy of the collective bargaining\n\nagreement,” and the “‘right to nominate\ncandidates, to vote in elections of the\nlabor organization, to attend\nmembership meetings, and to\nparticipate in the deliberations and\nvoting upon business properly before\nthe meeting.” Those rights are not found\nin the NLRA, but instead arise from\nother Federal labor laws not\nadministered by the NLRB. See Labor-\nManagement Reporting and Disclosure\nAct of 1959, 29 U.S.C. 401 et seq\n(LMRDA). The Board finds that it would\nbe inappropriate to include those\nadditional rights in a notice informing\nemployees of their rights under the\nNLRA.\n\nvi. Other Comments\n\nThe Board has also considered, but\nrejected, the contention that the notice\ncontain simply a “short and plain”\ndescription of rights such as that used\nin remedial notices. See Ishikawa\nGasket America, Inc., above. The two\nnotices have different purposes: one\nlooks back; the other, forward. As\nexplained in the NPRM, the principal\npurpose of a remedial notice is to\ninform employees of unlawful conduct\nthat has taken place and what is being\ndone to remedy that conduct.\nAccordingly, although a remedial notice\ncontains only a brief summary of NLRA\nrights, it also contains examples of\nunlawful actions that have been\ncommitted. To the extent that such a\nnotice generally increases employees’\nawareness of their rights, the unlawful\nconduct detailed adds to that awareness.\nThe proposed notice, by contrast, is a\nnotice intended to make employees\naware of their NLRA rights generally. It\nnormally will not be posted against a\nbackground of already-committed unfair\nlabor practices; it therefore needs to\ncontain a summary both of NLRA rights\nand examples of unlawful conduct in\norder to inform employees effectively of\nthe extent of their NLRA rights and of\nthe availability of remedies for\nviolations of those rights. Moreover, as\nthe Board explained in the NPRM, the\ngeneral notice of rights posted in the\npre-election notice is sufficient because\nat least one union along with the\nemployer is on the scene to enlighten\nemployees of their rights under the\nNLRA. 75 FR 80412 fn.19.\n\nThe fundamental rights described in\nthe notice are well established and have\nbeen unchanged for much of the Board’s\nhistory. Accordingly, the Board does not\nshare the concern expressed in some\ncomments that a new notice will have\nto be posted each time the composition\nof the Board changes.\n\nFinally, the Board rejects the\ncontention that the notice should\n\naddress certain rights of employers. The\nnotice is intended to inform employees\nof their rights, not those of their\nemployers.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the\nBoard finds it unnecessary to modify the\nsection of the notice summarizing\nemployees’ NLRA rights.\n\nc. The Examples of Unlawful Employer\nConduct in the Notice\n\nThe proposed notice contained the\nfollowing examples of unlawful\nconduct:\n\nUnder the NLRA, it is illegal for your\nemployer to:\n\nProhibit you from soliciting for a union\nduring non-work time, such as before or after\nwork or during break times; or from\ndistributing union literature during non-work\ntime, in non-work areas, such as parking lots\nor break rooms.\n\nQuestion you about your union support or\nactivities in a manner that discourages you\nfrom engaging in that activity.\n\nFire, demote, or transfer you, or reduce\nyour hours or change your shift, or otherwise\ntake adverse action against you, or threaten\nto take any of these actions, because you join\nor support a union, or because you engage in\nconcerted activity for mutual aid and\nprotection, or because you choose not to\nengage in any such activity.\n\nThreaten to close your workplace if\nworkers choose a union to represent them.\n\nPromise or grant promotions, pay raises, or\nother benefits to discourage or encourage\nunion support.\n\nProhibit you from wearing union hats,\nbuttons, t-shirts, and pins in the workplace\nexcept under special circumstances.\n\nSpy on or videotape peaceful union\nactivities and gatherings or pretend to do so.\n75 FR 80419.\n\nThe Board received limited comments\non six of the seven examples of\nunlawful employer conduct. As a\ngeneral matter, some comments contend\nthat the number of examples of\nemployer misconduct is\ndisproportionate compared to the\nexamples of union misconduct.1°® Most\nof the comments refer to the number of\nparagraphs devoted to illegal employer\nconduct (7) and the number of\nparagraphs devoted to illegal union\nconduct (5). Several comments indicate\nthat when one compares the employer\nmisconduct listed in Section 8(a) of the\nNLRA with union misconduct listed in\nSection 8(b), no such imbalance appears\nin the text of the statute. Several\ncomments provide additional examples\nof union misconduct that they say\nshould be included.\n\nAs with the notice’s statement of\naffirmative rights, some of the\n\n108 See, e.g., comments of COLLE, Baker &\nMcKenzie, National Association of Manufacturers,\nand American Trucking Association.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022294",
