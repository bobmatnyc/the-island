  "text": "86 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\n\nright.'°° The reason for adopting such a broad right was that “[t]oo often\nvictims of crime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the\ncriminal justice system. This provision is intended to direct Government\nagencies and employees, whether they are in the executive or judiciary\nbranch, to treat victims of crime with the respect they deserve.”!°° OLC’s\nfailure to consider the purposes underlying the CVRA is a glaring\noversight.\n\nOLC never attempts to explain why the CVRA’s drafters would want\nvictims to have a right to fair treatment once criminal charges were filed but\npossess no such right before the filing of criminal charges. Clearly, many\nvictims can and do suffer secondary victimization during criminal\ninvestigations, such as when sexual assault victims are treated\ninappropriately by law enforcement agents.'°’ It would contradict the\npurpose of preventing victim mistreatment in the criminal justice system to\nartificially limit the right to fairness to the point at which charges are filed.\nThe night to fairness logically applies at all stages of the criminal justice\nprocess.\n\nC. OLC’S INEFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO THE CVRA’S COVERAGE AND\nVENUE PROVISIONS\n\nAt the end of its memorandum, OLC finally discusses what it\nidentifies as the two strongest arguments for construing the CVRA as\napplying before charging: the coverage provision and the venue provision.\nOLC acknowledges, as it must, that the CVRA’s coverage extends to any\nfederal employee engaged in “the defection, investigation or prosecution of\ncrime.”'*’ Such employees “shall make their best efforts to see that crime\nvictims are notified of, and accorded, the rights” afforded by the statute.'°’\nNotably, this duty applies to individuals not just in the Justice Department\n(where all federal prosecutors are located) but other agencies as well, such\n\n155 150 Cona.
