This influence herds points into shadowing the main road of the\ndynamics, like the hair of the dog that stay close to the real body of the animal in\nmotion. It is in this way that just a few often slightly off the mark points nonetheless\nshadow the real (called fiduciary) orbits of the attractor, outlining its global geometry\nwith just a little information.\n\nThe intuitive reason shadowing works Is built into these natural countervailing\ntendencies of hyperbolic dynamics, which on one hand tends to spread out nearby\ninitial points and brings disparate others together. The latter inclination is the one\nthat smoothes down the escaping points onto surfaces of actions that\nmathematicians call manifolds. However, the details of the orbital paths don’t look\nthat orderly due to the mixing of the sequence of points in hyperbolic motion. The\nmixing process on manifolds has been analogized to that of the bundled pink loops\nof the stretching (expanding) and folding (contracting) taffy puller at the carnival\ncandy stand. The process gets sequences of small particles of candy out of\nsequential order while maintaining the taffy’s overall geometrically ovoid shape.\nDisorder is local with the entropy being generated by the repeatedly shuffling of the\nline up of the original orbital sequence. This results in the impossibility of any point-\nto-point prediction for more than a few points even though the over all shape is\nmaintained. Exactly what minute a habitually late sleeper awakes can’t be\npredicted. On the other hand, the skeletal manifold of the global structure is entirely\nin evidence from almost the beginning. Late risers remain late risers even without a\nprecise, minute-to-minute, predictable schedule.\n\nIt is also interesting that a uniformly hyperbolic dynamical system, unlike the\nfixed-point attractors of stylistic fixation, resist perturbation-induced changes in\nglobal dynamical form. In an apparent paradox worthy of metaphysical allusion, the\ndynamically hyperbolic kind of formlessness has structural stability. The global\ngeometric predictability of this point-to-point, completely unpredictable system can\nbe both the subject and object of Zen frustration and thoughtful meditation.\n\nDuring weekly professorial rounds at Los Angeles’s Neuropsychiatric\n\nInstitute, | assigned a standard exercise for psychiatric residents on clinical rounds,\n\n27\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013527",
