Introduction\nCrime victims are virtually absent from the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. The sixty federal rules comprehensively\ncover every aspect of federal criminal proceedings - from initial appearance through preliminary hearing, arraignment,\nacceptance of pleas, trial, and sentencing. Yet the rules substantively mention victims only once, briefly recognizing the right\nof some victims to speak at sentencing. 1\nThe federal rules can no longer leave victims unmentioned. In October 2004, Congress passed and President Bush signed into\nlaw the Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, and Nila Lynn Crime Victims' Rights Act (CVRA).\n2 The CVRA transforms crime victims into participants in the criminal justice process by (among other things) guaranteeing\nthem notice of court hearings, the right to attend those hearings, and the opportunity to testify at appropriate points in the\nprocess. These new victims' rights will reshape the federal criminal justice system and force significant changes to the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure to reflect the victim's expanded role. This Article offers comprehensive proposals for changing the\nfederal rules to both implement the CVRA and reflect sound public policy. The CVRA dictates changes like these to the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure because only by integrating victims into the federal rules will Congress's goal of making victims\nparticipants in the process be fully realized.\nThis Article is divided into five parts. Following this introduction, Part II reviews the current absence of victims from the\nfederal rules. Surprisingly, even where the rules cover issues of great concern to victims, victims somehow go unmentioned.\n1\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(B); discussion infra note 3 and accompanying text.\n2\nCrime Victims' Rights Act, Pub. L. No. 108-405, 118 Stat. 2261 (2004) (codified at 18 U.S.C.A. 3771 (West 2004 & Supp. 2005)). The\nCVRA was part of a much larger piece of legislation that addressed a variety of subjects, known as the \"Justice for All Act.\" See generally\nSteven J. Twist, On the Wings of Their Angels: The Scott Campbell, Stephanie Roper, Wendy Preston, Louarna Gillis, Nila Lynn Crime\nVictims' Rights Act, 9 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. (forthcoming 2005).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *837\nPage 2 of 52\nPart II then discusses the crime victims' rights movement and concludes with a brief sketch of the events leading to the CVRA's\nenactment.\n[*838] Part III discusses why it is necessary to amend the federal criminal rules to incorporate victims. Although the CVRA is\na federal statute that automatically trumps any conflicting procedural rule, procedural rules drive day-to-day courtroom\npractices. Given that Congress was particularly concerned about integrating victims into the fabric of the criminal justice\nsystem, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules should amend the rules to directly reflect the CVRA's requirements.\nPart IV provides a rule-by-rule analysis of the changes needed in the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to implement the\nCVRA. Of particular importance is new language protecting crime victims' rights to be notified of and to be present and heard\nat public criminal proceedings. Congress should also implement the right to notice in a new rule mandating that prosecutors\nkeep victims apprised of criminal proceedings. In addition, the rules should also reflect victims' rights to attend court\nproceedings and to testify at bail, plea, and sentencing hearings. Part IV also discusses other significant changes needed to\nconform the rules to the CVRA: defining \"victim,\" giving victims notice before confidential information is subpoenaed,\nallowing victims to be heard before cases are transferred to remote districts, giving victims access to relevant parts of the presentence\nreport, permitting courts to appoint counsel for victims, and protecting the victim's right to proceedings free from\nunreasonable delay. Part V contains a brief conclusion.\nII. The Missing Victims of Crimes\nCrime victims are absent from the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. Yet this is not because victims lack vital interests in\ncriminal cases. As the CVRA recognizes, victims have vital concerns throughout the criminal process. This section recounts the\nabsence of victims from the federal criminal rules, then contrasts that absence with the aims of the victims' rights movement.\nThe movement has argued successfully before state legislatures and Congress for the recognition of crime victims' rights - with\nthese efforts culminating in the passage of the CVRA, protecting crime victims' rights in the federal system.\n[*839]\nA. The Victim's Absence from the Current Federal Criminal Rules\nThe sixty Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure provide the architecture for the entire federal criminal court process, including\ninitial appearance, preliminary hearing, arraignment, acceptance of pleas, trial, and sentencing. One would expect that the rules\nwould frequently mention crime victims, given the subjects - such as bail, scheduling, and restitution - that directly concern\nvictims. Yet amazingly, the current rules substantively use the word \"victim\" only a single time.\nThe single direct reference to victims is Rule 32(i)(4)(B), which directs that before imposing a sentence, \"the court must\naddress any victim of a crime of violence or sexual abuse who is present at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or\nsubmit any information about the sentence.\" 3 The word \"victim\" appears in passing in only two other rules: Rule 12.4 requires\nthe government to disclose to the court any organizational \"victim,\" 4 and the heading of Rule 38(e) mentions \"Restitution\"\nand \"Notice to Victims,\" but the text of the rule does not contain the term \"victim.\" 5\nVictims deserve far more than the single reference in Rule 32. While later parts of this Article work through the rules sectionby-section\nto illustrate where victims have been unfairly ignored, 6 a few examples here will prove the point. The rules\ncurrently fail to give victims any right to be heard regarding whether a judge should accept a plea, even though the judge must\nevaluate the public interest in deciding whether to do so. 7 The rules fail to require notice to victims before their confidential\n3\nFed.

P. 11; discussion infra notes 148-53 and accompanying text.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *839\nPage 3 of 52\ninformation is subpoenaed from third parties - such as schools or medical providers - even though victims have compelling\nprivacy interests to protect. 8 And the rules do not protect the victim's right to attend trials, despite [*840] victims' long\nhistory of having at least some protected interest in observing trials and other proceedings. 9\nOne provision conveniently encapsulates the surprising absence of victims from the rules: Rule 32(d)(2)(B). The drafters of this\nrule 10 appear to have been so afraid to utter the word \"victim\" that they did not use the term even when describing the person\nharmed by a crime. Rule 32(d)(2)(B) directs that a presentence report contain \"verified information, stated in a\nnonargumentative style, that assesses the financial, social, psychological, and medical impact on any individual against whom\nthe offense has been committed.\" 11 The phrasing of this provision is striking for several reasons. It eschews the\nstraightforward term \"victim,\" preferring instead the obscuring phrase \"individual against whom the offense has been\ncommitted.\" The provision also uses the responsibility-obscuring passive voice in describing the individual \"against whom\" the\noffense has been committed, leaving the reader to wonder who might have committed that offense (the defendant, perhaps?).\nInterestingly, the provision requires that information about the victim be \"verified.\" Fair enough - until one realizes that the\ndirectly adjacent provision regarding information about the defendant lacks a similar verification requirement. 12 Why would\ninformation about the victim need to be verified while information about the defendant would not? Finally, the provision\nrequires that victim information be stated in a \"nonargumentative\" style. Again, the adjacent defendant's provision contains no\nsuch direction. 13 In short, even a rule that seemingly must mention victims - the rule dictating preparation of a presentence\nreport describing the crime - manages to avoid mentioning the word.\nB. The Victims' Rights Movement\nThat victims are missing from the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure exemplifies their treatment in the modern American\n[*841] criminal justice system. As one commentator has described the situation, the victim is \"seen at best as \"the forgotten\nman' of the system and, at worst, as being twice victimized, the second time by the very system to which he has turned for\njustice.\" 14 The absence of victims conflicts with \"a public sense of justice keen enough that it has found voice in a nationwide\nvictims' rights movement.\" 15\nThe crime victims' rights movement developed in the 1970s because of a perceived imbalance in the criminal justice system.\nLed by feminist and civil rights activists, victims' advocates argued that the criminal justice system had become preoccupied\n8\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 17; discussion infra notes 177-91, and accompanying text.\n9\nSee Fed. R. Crim. P. 43; discussion infra notes 269-300 and accompanying text.\n10\nTo be clear, Congress, not the Advisory Committee on Criminal Law and Procedure, drafted the language of this rule. See Victims of\nCrime Act of 1984, Pub. L. No. 98-473, 98 Stat. 2014 (1984) (directly amending Rule 32).\n11\nFed. R. Crim.

The victims of crime have been\ntransformed into a group oppressively burdened by a system designed to protect them. This oppression must be redressed.\" 18\nThe Task Force advocated [*842] multiple reforms. It recommended that prosecutors assume the responsibility for keeping\nvictims notified of all court proceedings and bringing to the court's attention the victim's view on such subjects as bail, plea\nbargains, sentences, and restitution. 19 The Task Force also urged that courts receive victim impact evidence at sentencing,\norder restitution in most cases, and allow victims and their families to attend trials even if they are also called as witnesses. 20\nIn its most sweeping recommendation, the Task Force proposed a federal constitutional amendment to protect crime victims.\nThe Task Force proposed adding to the Sixth Amendment's protections for defendants' rights a provision allowing crime\nvictims to be present and heard: \"Likewise, the victim, in every criminal prosecution shall have the right to be present and to be\nheard at all critical stages of judicial proceedings.\" 21\nIn the wake of that recommendation, crime victims' advocates considered how best to pursue a federal constitutional\namendment that would protect victims' rights throughout the country. Recognizing the difficulty of obtaining the consensus\nrequired to amend the United States Constitution, advocates decided to go to the states first to pursue state victims' rights\namendments. This \"states-first\" strategy 22 met with considerable success. To date, some thirty states have adopted victims'\nrights amendments to their own state constitutions. 23 While these amendments take various forms, Arizona's amendment\nillustrates the types of rights typically protected. The Arizona constitutional provision gives victims the broad right to \"be\ntreated with fairness, respect, and dignity, and to [*843] be free from intimidation, harassment, or abuse, throughout the\ncriminal justice process.\" 24 It also specifically confers a right to \"be present at, and, upon request, to be informed of all\ncriminal proceedings where the defendant has the right to be present.\" 25 The amendment further allows victims to be heard at\nbail, plea, and sentencing hearings. 26\n16\nSee generally Beloof, Cassell & Twist, supra note 15, at ch. 1; Douglas E.

Rev. 835, *843\nPage 5 of 52\nThe movement also successfully prodded the federal system to recognize victims' rights. In 1982 Congress passed the first\nfederal victims' rights legislation, the Victim and Witness Protection Act (VWPA). 27 The VWPA had three primary goals: (1)\nto expand and protect the role of victims and witnesses in the criminal justice process; (2) to ensure that the federal government\nused all available resources to protect and assist victims without infringing defendants' constitutional rights; and (3) to provide\na model for state and local legislation. 28 Since passage of the VWPA, Congress has remained active in this area of the law,\npassing several acts further protecting victims' rights, such as the Victims of Crime Act of 1984, 29 the Victims' Rights and\nRestitution Act of 1990, 30 the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, 31 the Antiterrorism and Effective\nDeath Penalty Act of 1996, 32 and the Victim Rights Clarification Act of 1997. 33 Other federal statutes have been passed to\ndeal with specialized victim situations such as child victims and witnesses. 34\n[*844] These statutes spawned guidelines for how federal prosecutors should treat crime victims. The VWPA required the\nAttorney General to develop guidelines for the Department of Justice. 35 To implement this Act, the Attorney General\ndeveloped guidelines designed to assist victims during the criminal justice process, mandating protocol, separate waiting areas\nat court, the prompt return of the victim's property, and victim training for law enforcement personnel. 36 The guidelines also\ndirected that prosecutors notify victims about available services, major case events, consultations with the prosecutor, and the\nopportunity for consultation about the prosecution. 37 In 2000, Attorney General Reno updated and expanded the guidelines.\nThe revised guidelines heightened the notification requirements, requiring prosecutors and law enforcement agents to notify\nvictims of important criminal justice events and to confer with victims about important decisions in the process. 38\nAmong the federal victims' statutes, the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 is noteworthy. This Act purported to create\na comprehensive list of victims' rights in the federal criminal justice process. It commanded that \"[a] crime victim has the\nfollowing rights\" and then listed various procedural rights, including the right to \"be treated with fairness and with respect for\nthe victim's dignity and privacy,\" 39 to \"be notified of court proceedings,\" 40 to \"confer with [the] attorney for the Government\nin the case,\" 41 and to attend court proceedings even if called as a witness. 42 The statute also directed the Justice Department\n27\nPub.

Rev. 835, *844\nPage 6 of 52\nto make \"its best efforts\" to ensure [*845] that victims' rights were protected. 43 Yet this federal statute never successfully\nintegrated victims into the federal criminal justice process and instead became something of a dead letter. Because Congress\npassed the CVRA in 2004 to remedy the problems with the 1990 Act, a brief review of the law's shortcomings is valuable.\nCuriously, the 1990 Victims' Rights and Restitution Act was codified in Title 42 of the United States Code - the Title dealing\nwith \"Public Health and Welfare.\" Such placement effectively limited the Act's effectiveness because federal practitioners\nreflexively consult Title 18, the Title that covers \"Crimes and Criminal Procedure,\" 44 for guidance on criminal law issues.\nMore prosaically, federal criminal enactments are bound together in a single West publication entitled the Federal Criminal\nCode and Rules. This publication is carried to court by prosecutors and defense attorneys and is on the desk of most federal\njudges. Because West Publishing never included the Victims' Rights Act in this book, the statute was essentially unknown even\nto experienced judges and attorneys. 45\nThe prime illustration of the ineffectiveness of the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act comes from the Oklahoma City\nbombing case. 46 While one might expect victims' rights would have been fully protected during such a high profile trial, in\nfact victims were denied one fundamental right: the right to observe court proceedings. During a pretrial motion hearing, the\ndistrict court sua sponte precluded any victim who wished to provide victim impact testimony at sentencing from observing\nproceedings in the case. 47 The court based its ruling on Rule 615 of the Federal Rules of Evidence - the so-called \"Rule on\nWitnesses.\" 48 Thirty-five victims and survivors of [*846] the bombing then filed a motion for reconsideration. 49 They\nnoted that the district court apparently had overlooked the Victims' Rights Act giving victims the right \"to be present at all\npublic court proceedings related to the offense, unless the court determines that testimony by the victim would be materially\naffected if the victim heard other testimony at trial.\" 50 The district court denied the motion for reconsideration. 51 It\nconcluded that victims present during court proceedings would not be able to separate the \"experience of trial\" from \"the\nexperience of loss from the conduct in question,\" and, thus, their testimony at a sentencing hearing would be inadmissible. 52\nUnlike the original ruling, which was explicitly premised on Rule 615, the later ruling was more ambiguous, alluding to\nconcerns under the Constitution, the common law, and the rules of evidence. 53\n40\nId. 10606(b)(3) (repealed 2004).\n41\nId. 10606(b)(5) (repealed 2004).\n42\nId. 10606(b)(4) (repealed 2004).

That request became moot with the passage\nof the CVRA, which moved victims' rights from obscurity in Title 42 to centrality in Title 18, thereby guaranteeing them a spot in the West\npublication.\n46\nSee generally Paul G.

The victims also relied on a similar provision found in the authorization for closed circuit\nbroadcasting of the trial, 42 U.S.C.A. 10608(a) (West Supp. 1998), and on a First Amendment right of access to public court proceedings. See\nRichmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 448 U.S. 555, 577 (1980) (finding First Amendment right of court access).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *846\nPage 7 of 52\nThe victims subsequently filed a petition for writ of mandamus in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit seeking\nreview of the district court's ruling. 54 Three months later, a Tenth Circuit panel rejected the victims' claims. 55 The circuit\nfound \"a number of problems with the excluded witnesses' reliance on the Victims' Rights Act.\" 56 Indeed, the circuit found\nthat the Act created no obligations for courts:\n[*847]\nThe statute charily pledges only the \"best efforts\" of certain executive branch personnel to secure the rights listed. The district\ncourt judge, a judicial officer not bound in any way by this pledge, could not violate the Act. Indeed, the Act's prescriptions\nwere satisfied once the government made its arguments against sequestration - before the district court even ruled. 57\nEfforts by both the victims and the Department of Justice to obtain a rehearing were unsuccessful, 58 despite the support of\nseparate briefs urging such a rehearing from forty-nine members of Congress, all six Attorneys General in the Tenth Circuit,\nand some of the leading victims' groups in the nation. 59\nIn the meantime, the victims, supported by the Oklahoma Attorney General's Office, sought remedial legislation in Congress\nclearly providing that victims should not have to decide between testifying at sentencing or watching the trial. A bill was\nintroduced to provide that watching a trial in a capital case does not constitute grounds for denying a victim the chance to\nprovide an impact statement. In a matter of weeks, Congress passed the Victims Rights Clarification Act of 1997, 60 but even\nthat specific statute failed to protect the bombing victims' rights. The district court in the Oklahoma City case found that the\nstatute had constitutional problems. 61\nBecause of the difficulty accompanying the statutory protection of victims' rights, victims advocates decided to press for a\nfederal constitutional amendment. They argued that the statutory [*848] protections could not sufficiently guarantee victims'\nrights.

These significant state efforts simply are not sufficiently consistent, comprehensive, or authoritative\nto safeguard victims' rights. 63\nTo place victims' rights in the Constitution, victims advocates - led most prominently by the National Victims Constitutional\nAmendment Network 64 - approached the President and Congress regarding a federal amendment. 65 On April 22, 1996,\nSenators Kyl and Feinstein with the backing of President Clinton introduced a federal victims' rights amendment. 66 The\namendment was intended to \"restore, preserve, and protect, as a matter of right for the victims of violent crimes, the practice of\nvictim participation in the administration of criminal justice that was the birthright of every American at the founding of our\nNation.\" 67 A companion resolution was introduced in the House of Representatives. 68 The proposed amendment embodied\nseven core principles: (1) the right to notice of proceedings, (2) the right to be present at the proceedings, (3) the right to be\nheard, (4) the right to notice of the defendant's [*849] release or escape, (5) the right to restitution, (6) the right to a speedy\ntrial, and (7) the right to reasonable protection. In a later resolution, an eighth principle was added: the right to standing to\nenforce these rights. 69 The 104th Congress did not pass the amendment.\nOn January 21, 1997, the opening day of the first session of the 105th Congress, Senators Kyl and Feinstein reintroduced the\nvictims' rights amendment. 70 A series of hearings were held that year in both the House and the Senate. 71 Kyl and Feinstein\nreintroduced the amendment the following year. 72 The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings 73 and passed the proposed\namendment out of committee. 74 Yet again, the full Senate did not consider the amendment.\nIn 1999, Senators Kyl and Feinstein again proposed the amendment, 75 and on September 30, 1999, the Judiciary Committee\nvoted, as before, to send the amendment to the full Senate. 76 But on April 27, 2000, after three days of floor debate, the\namendment was shelved when it became clear that its opponents, who objected to constitutionalizing victims' rights, possessed\nthe necessary votes to sustain a filibuster. 77 At the same time, hearings on the companion measure were held in the House. 78\n63\nFocusing on the Administration of Justice and the Enforcement of Laws: Dep't of Justice Oversight Hearing Before the S.

On April 15, 2002, Senators Kyl and\nFeinstein reintroduced the Amendment in the Senate, 79 and the following day, President Bush announced his support. 80 On\nMay 1, [*850] 2002, a companion measure was proposed in the House. 81 On January 7, 2003, Senators Kyl and Feinstein\nproposed the amendment as Senate Judiciary Resolution 1. The Senate Judiciary Committee held hearings in April of that year,\n82 followed by a written report supporting the Amendment. 83 Shortly thereafter, a motion to proceed to consideration of the\nmeasure was withdrawn when proponents determined they did not have the sixty-seven votes necessary to pass the\namendment. After it became clear that the necessary super-majority votes to amend the Constitution were not attainable,\nvictims' advocates turned their attention to enacting a comprehensive victims' rights statute.\nC. The Crime Victims' Rights Act\nThe Crime Victims' Rights Act ultimately resulted from a decision by the victims' movement to seek a more comprehensive\nand enforceable federal statute rather than to continue pursuing the more ambitious goal of a federal constitutional amendment.\nIn April 2004, victims advocates met with Senators Kyl and Feinstein to decide whether to push yet again for a federal\nconstitutional amendment. Conceding that the amendment had only majority support in Congress rather than the necessary\nsuper-majority, the advocates decided to press for a far-reaching federal statute protecting victims' rights in the federal criminal\njustice system. 84 In exchange for backing off from the federal amendment in the short term, victims' advocates received nearuniversal\ncongressional support for a \"broad and encompassing\" statutory victims' bill of rights. 85 This new approach not only\nestablished a string of victims' rights but also provided funding for victims' legal services and created remedies for the violation\nof victims' rights. 86 The victims' [*851] movement is currently evaluating the success of the statute before deciding whether\nto continue pushing for a federal amendment. 87\nThe Crime Victims' Rights Act gives victims \"the right to participate in the system.\" 88 To facilitate such participation, the Act\ngrants victims eight specific rights:\n(1) The right to be reasonably protected from the accused;\n(2) The right to reasonable, accurate, and timely notice of any public court proceeding, or any parole proceeding, involving the\ncrime or of any release or escape of the accused;\n(3) The right not to be excluded from any such public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear and convincing\nevidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other testimony at that\nproceeding;\n79\nS.J.

The Need To Place Victims' Rights in the Rules\nWith the CVRA in place as the law of the land, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be amended to conform to the\nstatute. While one court has derisively referred to the Act as mere \"mushy, feel good legislation,\" 97 it in fact substantively\nchanges the posture of crime victims on a whole host of issues. In the wake of the Act, victims now must be folded into the\nprocess through which federal courts conduct criminal cases, including bail, plea, trial, and sentencing hearings. The Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure - the \"playbook\" of the federal courts - should reflect this fact.\nSome might agree that victims now have a number of new rights, but nonetheless dispute the need for a rules amendment.\nAfter all, it might be argued, the CVRA in fact creates substantive rights for crime victims. Because nothing in the federal\nprocedural [*853] rules can modify substantive rights, 98 the CVRA will trump any conflicting provision in the federal rules.\n99 In other words, the CVRA will automatically govern federal criminal proceedings even if the rules remain as written.\n89\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n90\nId. 3771(d).\n91\nCf.

Rev. 835, *853\nPage 11 of 52\nWhile this argument is legally precise, as a practical matter, compelling reasons justify amending the federal rules to include\nvictims. Congress intended that the CVRA's new rights not be \"simply words on paper,\" but rather \"meaningful and functional\"\nreforms. 100 To that end, Congress mandated that courts shall \"ensure\" that crime victims are \"afforded the rights\" conveyed\nby the CVRA. 101 To effectively ensure that victims' rights are protected, these rights must become part of the warp and woof\nof the criminal process. That can occur only if the federal rules - the day-to-day operations manual of the courts - spell out how\nto integrate victims into the process.\nJudges and practitioners frequently refer to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for guidance as to how to conduct\nhearings. If victims' rights are left out of the federal rules, the strong possibility exists that courts may mistakenly disregard\nvictims' rights under the CVRA. A good illustration comes from Rule 11, which spells out in some detail how judges should\nconduct a hearing accepting a plea. The judge is required to personally inform the defendant of certain specified rights and\nensure that the defendant understands he will be waiving those rights. 102 The judge must also determine that the defendant is\nvoluntarily entering the plea and that there is a factual basis for the guilty plea. 103 Under the CVRA, victims now also have the\nright to be heard before the judge accepts any plea. 104 This is a new right, 105 which judges are not accustomed to\nadministering. Unless the victim's right to be heard is specifically spelled out in Rule 11's plea procedures, some judges may\ninadvertently disregard it.\n[*854] The Oklahoma City bombing case further demonstrates how courts sometimes blindly follow the federal rules without\nconsidering superseding statutes. In that case, the court excluded victim-witnesses from certain proceedings, relying solely on\nFederal Rule of Evidence 615 in making its determination. In denying the witnesses entrance to the proceedings, the court was\napparently unaware of the provision in the Victims' Rights and Restitution Act protecting a victim's right to attend. 106 This\ndeficiency was called to the attention of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence. 107 The committee\nacknowledged the need to include victims in the evidence rules and later added a new provision reflecting the victim's right to\nattend. 108\nOne reason for including victims' rights in the rules is to avoid litigation about the negative inferences that might be drawn if\nvictims' rights are not in the rules. It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n(the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of the other). This canon of construction applies to the federal rules as much\nas to statutes. 109 Because the rules repeatedly spell out situations in which the defendant has the right to have his interests\nconsidered but say nothing about victims, it might be argued that the rules have implicitly determined that a victim's interests\nare irrelevant. To return to the Rule 11 plea example, given that the criminal rules specify that a court must address the\ndefendant but lack any comparable requirement for victims, it might be inferred that victims cannot speak at plea hearings.

Rev. 835, *854\nPage 12 of 52\nsuch conclusion would be contrary to the plain language of the CVRA. 110 To avoid possible confusion, the rules should be\nclear on this point.\nAn additional reason for integrating victims into the federal rules is that Congress seemingly expects this to happen. Congress\nadopted the CVRA with the express goal of making the new law \"a formula [*855] for success\" and a \"model for our States.\"\n111 Congress clearly wants the new law aggressively implemented, thereby avoiding the need for further legislative action or\neven, possibly, a federal constitutional amendment. Congress is watching to see whether the Judiciary (and the Executive) will\nfully and fairly implement this new Act. As Senator Leahy warned, \"Passage of this bill will necessitate careful oversight of its\nimplementation by Congress.\" 112\nConstruing the CVRA to require changes is also appropriate because the Act is remedial legislation. As the Supreme Court has\ninstructed, \"When Congress uses broad generalized language in a remedial statute, and that language is not contravened by\nauthoritative legislative history, a court should interpret the provision generously so as to effectuate the important congressional\ngoals.\" 113 The congressional sponsors described the victims' rights in the CVRA as \"broad rights,\" 114 the significance of\nwhich should not \"be whittled down or marginalized by the courts or the executive branch. This legislation is meant to correct,\nnot continue, the legacy of the poor treatment of crime victims in the criminal process.\" 115\nA final reason for amending the rules is that crime victims' groups are looking for the effective implementation of the CVRA.\nThey are urging that the federal rules be comprehensively amended to reflect victims' rights; indeed, they have even suggested\nthat Congress should directly amend the federal rules to include victims' rights. 116 The Judiciary would be well advised not to\nignore these lobbying efforts. Victims have proven very effective at advancing legislation in Congress, particularly where they\nhave legitimate grievances about how they have been treated. 117\nMoreover, allowing the initiative for drafting of rules to pass from the Judiciary to Congress is not ideal. The Advisory\nCommittee on Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure includes many skilled [*856] members with considerable experience in\ndrafting rules. The Committee is well aware of the CVRA. Shortly after the passage of the CVRA, the Committee withdrew a\nmodest victim amendment it was proposing in anticipation of the need to make more extensive changes, 118 and is already\nworking on proposed amendments to the rules. 119 It is preferable to have victims integrated into the federal rules through\ncareful drafting by the Committee rather than by the potentially blunderbuss approach of direct congressional action.\nFor all these reasons, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be comprehensively amended to recognize the interests\nof crime victims and thereby to allow victims to be full participants in the criminal process.\nIV. Proposed Amendments to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure To Implement the CVRA\nWith the goal of effectively implementing the CVRA firmly in mind, the remainder of this Article proposes twenty-eight\nspecific rule changes for consideration by the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules.

Rev. 835, *856\nPage 13 of 52\nrecite a specific proposed change followed by the rationale for that change as both a matter of law and of policy. For\nconvenience, this Article discusses the proposed changes sequentially, beginning with Rule 1.\nRule 1 - Definition of \"Victim\"\nThe Proposal:\nRule 1 should be amended to include the following definition of a victim:\n\"Victim\" means a person directly and proximately harmed as a result of the commission of a federal offense or an offense in the\nDistrict of Columbia. In the case of a crime victim who is under 18 years of age, incompetent, incapacitated, or deceased, the\nlegal guardians of the crime victim or the representatives of the crime victim's estate, family members, or any other persons\nappointed as [*857] suitable by the court, may assume the crime victim's rights under these rules, but in no event shall the\ndefendant be named as such guardian or representative.\nThe Rationale:\nThe CVRA directly defines \"victim\" using this language, 120 which ought to be folded into the rules for convenience. The\nrules currently define such terms as \"attorney for the government,\" \"federal judge,\" and \"petty offense.\" 121 \"Victim\" should\nlikewise be defined.\nA definition is required for a second reason: Rule 32 currently contains a differing definition of \"victim\" as \"an individual\nagainst whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence.\" 122 Because that definition varies\nfrom that mandated by the CVRA, it must be changed. Furthermore, the CVRA's definition comes with an interpretative\nhistory. 123 The CVRA's definition of \"victim\" is taken almost verbatim from the 1996 Mandatory Victims Restitution Act\n(MVRA). 124 In turn, the MVRA drew on the 1982 Victim Witness Protection Act (VWPA). 125 As a result, the CVRA uses a\ndefinition of \"victim\" that is more than twenty-two years old and that has not produced major administrative or definitional\nproblems. Courts will be able to draw from that history to determine who qualifies as a \"victim.\" 126\n120\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(e) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n121\nSee Fed. R. Crim.

Fed. 828 (2005).\nA few new issues will need to be litigated. For example, the Hughey case noted above conflicts with the views of Senator Jon Kyl, cosponsor\nof the CVRA, who explained that the definition of \"victim\" in the CVRA is an intentionally broad definition because \"all victims of\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *857\nPage 14 of 52\n[*858] Rule 1 also appears to be the best place to include the CVRA's language about a \"representative\" of a victim. This\nlanguage, too, draws from the restitution statutes. 127\nRule 2 - Fairness to Victims in Construction\nThe Proposal:\nRule 2 should be amended to require fairness to victims in construing the rules as follows:\nThese rules are to be interpreted to provide for the just determination of every criminal proceeding, to secure simplicity in\nprocedure and fairness in administration to the government, defendants, and victims, and to eliminate unjustifiable expense and\ndelay.\nThe Rationale:\nThe CVRA broadly mandates that victims have the right to \"be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity\nand privacy.\" 128 This creates a substantive right to fairness, similar to that found in various state victims' rights amendments -\nincluding the [*859] amendment found in Senator Kyl's home state of Arizona. 129 This broad reading was explained by\nSenator Kyl, who, along with Senators Feinstein and Hatch, was the primary legislative sponsor of the CVRA: \"The broad\nrights articulated in this section are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational.

During the prosecution of a case, the attorney for the government shall, at the earliest reasonable\nopportunity, identify the victims of the crime.\n[*860]\n(b) Notice of Case Events. During the prosecution of a crime, the attorney for the government shall make reasonable efforts to\nprovide victims the earliest possible notice of:\n(1) The scheduling, including scheduling changes and/or continuances, of each court proceeding that the victim is either\nrequired to attend or entitled to attend;\n(2) The release or detention status of a defendant or suspected offender;\n(3) The filing of charges against a defendant, or the proposed dismissal of all charges, including the placement of the defendant\nin a pretrial diversion program and the conditions thereon;\n(4) The right to make a statement about pretrial release of the defendant;\n(5) The victim's right to make a statement about acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere;\n(6) The victim's right to attend public proceedings;\n(7) If the defendant is convicted, the date and place set for sentencing and the victim's right to address the court at sentencing;\nand\n(8) After the defendant is sentenced, the sentence imposed and the availability of the Bureau of Prisons notification program,\nwhich shall provide the date, if any, on which the offender will be eligible for parole or supervised release.\n(c) Multiple Victims. The attorney for the government shall advise the court if the attorney believes that the number of victims\nmakes it impracticable to provide personal notice to each victim. If the court finds that the number of victims makes it\nimpracticable to give personal notice to each victim desiring to receive notice, the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure\ncalculated to give reasonable notice under the circumstances.\nThe Rationale:\nThis proposed change stems from the CVRA's requirement that victims have the \"right to reasonable, accurate, and timely\nnotice of [*861] any public court proceeding … involving the crime.\" 131 Senator Feinstein explained the importance of\ngiving victims notice:\nVictims are the persons who are directly harmed by the crime and they have a stake in the criminal process because of that\nharm. Their lives are significantly altered by the crime and they have to live with the consequences for the rest of their lives. To\ndeny them the opportunity to know of and be present at proceedings is counter to the fundamental principles of this country. It\nis simply wrong. 132\nUnder the CVRA, then, victims of the crime allegedly committed by the defendant 133 are entitled to notice of court\nproceedings. The tricky issue is who should provide that notice to victims. This responsibility must fall on prosecutors and their\ninvestigative agents for several reasons. First, prosecutors and their agents are the only parties who know the identity of the\nvictims at the outset of the case. After a bank robbery, for example, it is the FBI agents who respond and interview the tellers.\n131\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(2).\n132\n150 Cong. Rec. S4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein); see also id. at S4267 (statement of Sen. Kyl) (\"It does not\nmake sense to enact victims' rights that are rendered useless because the victim never knew of the proceeding at which the right had to be\nasserted.\").\n133\nSee United States v. Guevara-Toloso, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 9762 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (noting that CVRA requires notice to victims of the\ncrime charged against the defendant but not notice to victims of any previous crimes the defendant may have committed).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *861\nPage 16 of 52\nSecond, prosecutors and their agents continue dealing with victims throughout the course of a prosecution. They work with\nvictims in investigating the crime, identifying potential defendants, preparing the indictment, and presenting evidence to the\ngrand jury and at trial. Because of this working relationship, prosecutors are best situated to provide notice in most cases.\nThird, most crime victims lack legal counsel and are unfamiliar with federal criminal proceedings. They may need assistance\nfrom someone familiar with the process to understand what is happening. United States Attorneys' offices, including the victimwitness\ncomponents in those offices, are well situated to provide that assistance. As the President's [*862] Task Force of\nVictims of Crime concluded, the prosecutor is \"in the best position to explain to victims the legal significance of various\nmotions and proceedings.\" 134 For all these reasons, prosecutors should notify victims of their rights and of upcoming\nhearings. 135 Most states that have addressed the issue follow this approach. 136\nThe Justice Department appears to agree that it should notify victims. In the 2000 Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and\nWitness Assistance, the Department required prosecutors and their [*863] agents to provide notice to crime victims. In\nparticular, the Guidelines currently obligate prosecutors to provide victims with \"the earliest possible notice\" of:\n(a) The release or detention status of an offender or suspected offender … .\n(b) The filing of charges against a suspected offender, or the proposed dismissal of all charges … .\n(c) The scheduling, including scheduling changes and/or continuances, of each court proceeding that the victim or witness is\neither required to attend or entitled to attend … .\n(d) The acceptance of a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or the rendering of a verdict after trial … .\n(e) If the offender is convicted, the date set for sentencing, the sentence imposed … . 137\n134\nPresident's Task Force on Victims of Crime, Final Report 64 (1982).\n135\nBut cf.

Supp. 2d 319, 328 (E.D.N.Y. 2005) (concluding that, in the absence of a national rule requiring\nprosecutors to provide notice to victims, the court would direct the prosecutor to provide the name and contact information of each victim so\nthat the court can ensure that notice is properly given).\n136\nSee, e.g., Ala.

Rev. 835, *863\nPage 17 of 52\nTo avoid creating only significant new responsibilities for prosecutors and their agents, the proposed new Rule 10.1 is lifted\nessentially verbatim from the 2000 Attorney General Guidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance. The 2005 revisions to the\nGuidelines continue essentially the same requirements. 138\nThe drafters of the CVRA also appear to believe that the notification obligations will fall primarily on prosecutors' offices, as\nthe CVRA authorizes an appropriation of $ 22,000,000 over the next five fiscal years to the Office for Victims of Crime of the\nDepartment of Justice for enhancement of victim notification systems. 139 [*864] Presumably, those enhanced new\nnotification systems can be used to keep victims apprised of court proceedings. Moreover, the CVRA directs that the\nDepartment of Justice and its investigative agencies \"shall make their best efforts to see that crime victims are notified of, and\naccorded, the rights described in subsection (a).\" 140\nProposed new Rule 10.1 adds only two new obligations beyond those found in the 2000 Attorney General Guidelines: (1)\nnotice to victims of their right to make a statement regarding any proposed plea, and (2) notice to victims of their right to attend\npublic proceedings. Both of these obligations are currently found in the 2005 Guidelines. 141\nOne last issue deserves brief discussion: Is it proper for the Judiciary, through the rule-making process, to command another\nbranch of government to take certain actions? 142 The starting point for analyzing this question is the congressional command\nin the CVRA that the executive branch must protect victims' rights. 143 Consequently, implementing these rights through rule\nchanges presents no question of the courts inventing new rights or exercising some kind of \"supervisory\" power over federal\nagents. 144 Instead, the implementation is simply enforcing congressionally created rights through the Judiciary's\ncongressionally authorized rulemaking authority - an uncontroversial exercise of judicial power. 145 Moreover, in the CVRA,\nCongress commanded the courts to \"ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights described [in the CVRA].\" 146 Rule\nchanges needed to implement the CVRA thus rest [*865] on this statutory authority as well. Additionally, this Article's\nproposals affecting prosecutors are closely connected to court proceedings; they deal with such things as prosecutors notifying\nvictims of hearings and conferring with victims in anticipation thereof. It is difficult to see new separation of powers concerns\narising in such contexts so closely connected to the courtroom.\n137\nSee 2000 A.G. Guidelines, supra note 38; see also U.S. Dept. of Justice, Office for Victims of Crime, New Directions from the Field:\nVictims' Rights and Services for the 21st Century 82 (1998) (\"Prosecutors' offices should notify victims in a timely manner\" of all significant\nhearings.).\n138\nSee 2005 A.G. Guidelines, supra note 38, at 27-29 (providing for notice to victims, although relying on the department's Victim\nNotification Systems (VNS) to do this).\n139\nSee 118 Stat. 2260, 2264 (2004); see also 150 Cong. Rec. S4267 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (\"We authorized an\nappropriation of funds to assure … that moneys would be made available to enhance the victim notification system, managed by the\nDepartment of Justice's Office for Victims of Crime, and the resources additionally to develop state-of-the-art systems for notifying crime\nvictims of important statements of development) (emphasis added).

Rev. 835, *865\nPage 18 of 52\nFurthermore, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure already direct executive branch actions less directly connected to court\nhearings. For instance, Rule 16 directs that prosecutors must turn over various discoverable items to the defendant. 147 Rule 41\ndirects federal agents serving a warrant to leave a copy for the person whose premises are searched. 148 And, most\ncontroversially, Rule 5 directs that federal agents making an arrest \"must take the defendant without unnecessary delay\" before\na judicial officer. 149 The kinds of rule changes discussed in this Article are far less invasive than these commands. Finally, it\nshould be remembered that federal prosecutors serve as \"officers of the court.\" 150 In that capacity, the court can be reasonably\nexpected to facilitate victims' involvement in the criminal justice process. 151 For all of these reasons, this proposed rule breaks\nno new ground in directing prosecutors to notify victims of courtroom proceedings.\nRule 11(a)(3) - Victims' Views on Nolo Contendere Pleas\nThe Proposal:\nRule 11's procedures on pleas should be revised to allow victims to express their views on any plea of nolo contendere before\nthe court decides whether to accept it as follows:\n[*866]\n(a)(3) Nolo Contendere Plea. Before accepting a plea of nolo contendere, the court must consider the parties' and victims' views\nand the public interest in the effective administration of justice.\nThe Rationale:\nAs discussed at greater length in the immediately following sections, the CVRA gives victims the right to be heard regarding\nany plea, presumably including any nolo contendere plea. It is a natural corollary that the court should consider the victim's\nviews before accepting any such plea.\nRule 11(b)(4) - Victims' Right To Be Heard on Pleas\nThe Proposal:\nThe court should address any victim present in court when taking a plea in order to determine whether the victim wishes to\nmake a statement and to consider the victim's view before accepting a plea as follows:\n(4)[cfn ]Victims' Views. Before the court accepts a plea of guilty or nolo contendere or allows any plea to be withdrawn, the\ncourt must address any victim who is present personally in open court. During this address, the court must determine whether\nthe victim wishes to present views regarding the proposed plea or withdrawal and, if so, what those views are. The court shall\nconsider the victim's views in acting on the proposed plea or withdrawal.\nThe Rationale:\nThe CVRA gives victims the right \"to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving … [a] plea.\"\n152 Many states afford victims similar rights. 153 The rationale for a [*867] victim's right to be heard regarding a plea is to\n147\nFed.

The court is under no obligation to accept a plea proposed by the\nparties. 154 After hearing from the victim about the plea, the court can determine what weight to give to the victim's views. 155\nTo implement the victim's right to be heard regarding a plea, the proposed rule change requires the court to directly address any\nvictim present in court. This is consistent with the CVRA's legislative history that explains that \"this provision is intended to\nallow crime victims to directly address the court in person.\" 156 The language of the proposed rule is lifted from an earlier\nparagraph in Rule 11, which requires the court to \"address the defendant personally in open court\" \"before accepting a plea of\nguilty.\" 157 Victims should be treated even-handedly. It may be important for the judge to address victims directly because\nmany victims will lack the assistance of counsel. As novices in legal proceedings, victims may be uncertain about exactly when\nin the process they should present their views. By addressing victims, the court will eliminate that uncertainty and ensure that\nthe victim's right to be heard is vindicated.\n[*868]\nRule 11(c)(1) - Prosecution To Consider Victims' Views on Pleas\nThe Proposal:\nThe prosecution should be required to consider the victims' views in developing any proposed plea arrangement as follows:\n(1) In General. An attorney for the government and the defendant's attorney, or the defendant when proceeding pro se, may\ndiscuss and reach a plea agreement. The court must not participate in these discussions. The attorney for the government shall\nmake reasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider the victims' views about, any proposed plea negotiations. If\nthe defendant pleads guilty or nolo contendere to either a charged offense or a lesser or related offense, the plea agreement may\nspecify that an attorney for the government will … .\nThe Rationale:\nThe proposed change requires prosecutors to make reasonable efforts to notify victims about possible plea bargains and to\nconsider the victim's views regarding those pleas. This requirement is taken essentially verbatim from the Attorney General\nGuidelines for Victim and Witness Assistance, which direct prosecutors to \"make reasonable efforts to notify identified victims\n153\nSee, e.g., Conn. Const. art. 1, 8 (giving victim right to be heard and to object to plea agreement); Mo. Const. art. 1, 32 (giving victim right\nto be heard at plea hearing); Utah Const. art.

As Senator Feinstein explained, \"This right [to confer] is intended to be expansive. For example,\nthe victim has the [*869] right to confer with the Government concerning any critical stage or disposition of the case.\" 161\nBecause the overwhelming majority of federal criminal cases are resolved by a plea, a conference between the victim and the\nprosecutor regarding the plea will be critical in most cases. Reflecting that fact, the rules should follow the approach taken by\nthe majority of states, directing prosecutors to consult with victims about pleas.\nRule 11(c)(2) - Court To Be Advised of Victim Objections to Plea\nThe Proposal:\nProsecutors (and victims' attorneys) should be required to advise the court whenever they are aware that the victim objects to a\nproposed plea agreement as follows:\n(2) Disclosing a Plea Agreement. The parties must disclose the plea agreement in open court when the plea is offered, unless\nthe court for good cause allows the parties to disclose the plea agreement in camera. When a plea is presented in open court, the\nattorney for the government or the attorney for any victim shall advise the court when the attorney is aware that the victim has\nany objection to the proposed plea agreement.\nThe Rationale:\nWhen an attorney for the victim or for the government is aware that a victim objects to a plea, that information should be\nrelayed to the court. In those rare cases where the victim has an attorney, the attorney will obviously raise the victim's\nobjection. The proposed rule change clarifies the prosecutor's corresponding and equal obligation to communicate this\ninformation to the court.\nThe CVRA appears to obligate prosecutors to relay a victim's objection to the court, commanding them to use their \"best\nefforts\" to enforce victims' rights. 162 Part of those \"best efforts\" would seem to be conveying objections to the court. Victims\nare often untrained in the law and unexpectedly thrust into criminal proceedings; they may well believe that prosecutors\nautomatically relay to the court [*870] their objections to the plea. The proposed rule avoids such confusion by requiring the\nprosecutor to notify the court of a victim's concern. The rule is limited to situations where the prosecutor is aware of an\nobjection.\nThis approach is consistent with the instructive case of State v. Casey, 163 which considered whether a victim's objection to a\nplea made to a prosecutor was sufficient to trigger the victim's right to be heard under the Utah Constitution. 164 In Casey, the\nvictim told the prosecutor that she opposed a plea arrangement. The prosecutor refused to convey the victim's concern to the\n158\n2005 A.G.

The victim then obtained legal counsel and appealed to the Utah Supreme Court,\nurging that under the Utah Victims' Rights Amendment, her right to be heard regarding a plea had been violated. The State\nresponded that the victim was obligated to ask the trial court directly to be heard rather than relying on the prosecutor to pass\nthat information along. In rejecting the State's argument, the Utah Supreme Court explained that prosecutors, no less than other\nactors in the criminal justice system, were required to assist victims throughout the process. 165 More important for present\npurposes, the court also concluded that prosecutors had ethical obligations as officers of the court to convey that information to\nthe judge:\nProsecutors must convey such requests [to be heard] because they are obligated to alert the court when they know that the court\nlacks relevant information. This duty, which is incumbent upon all attorneys, is magnified for prosecutors because, as our case\nlaw has repeatedly noted, prosecutors have unique responsibilities… . The prosecutor is the representative not of an ordinary\nparty to a controversy, but of a sovereignty whose obligation to govern impartially is as compelling as its obligation to govern\nat all; and whose interest … in a criminal prosecution is not that it shall win … but that justice shall be done. 166\nApplying the reasoning of Casey to analogous rights in the CVRA, federal prosecutors must, as officers of the court, convey a\n[*871] victim's request to be heard regarding a plea. Indeed, the prosecutor should convey not only the request to be heard but\nalso the fact that the victim objects to the plea. In deciding whether to accept a plea, the court must consider the public interest.\n167 As the Tenth Circuit has explained, \"\"Rule 11 also contemplates the rejection of a negotiated plea when the district court\nbelieves that bargain is too lenient, or otherwise not in the public interest.'\" 168 When the prosecutor is aware of an objection\nfrom a keenly interested member of the public - the victim - the court should not be left in the dark about it.\nAn alternative way of drafting the rule is to require courts to inquire of prosecutors whether the victim has been advised of the\nproposed plea and whether the victim wishes to make a statement concerning it. 169 For example, Oregon requires the court to\nask the prosecutor whether the victim has been consulted about a plea and, if so, what the victim's view is:\nBefore the judge accepts a plea of guilty or no contest, the judge shall ask the district attorney if the victim requested to be\nnotified and consulted regarding plea discussions. If the victim has made such a request, the judge shall ask the district attorney\nif the victim agrees or disagrees with the plea discussions and agreement and the victim's reasons for agreement or\ndisagreement. 170\nSouth Dakota law contains a similar requirement that prosecutors disclose \"any comments\" by the victim about the plea. 171\nTexas law requires the court to ask the prosecutor whether a victim impact statement has been submitted; 172 if so, the court\n165\nCasey, 44 P.3d at 763.\n166\nId. at 764 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\n167\nSee, e.g., United States v.

Code Crim. Proc. Ann. art. 26.13(e) (Vernon Supp. 2004) (\"Before accepting a plea of guilty or a plea of nolo contendere, the court\nshall inquire as to whether a victim impact statement has been returned to the attorney representing the state and ask for a copy of the\nstatement if one has been returned.\").\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *871\nPage 22 of 52\nmust review that [*872] statement. 173 Finally, before an Arizona court accepts a plea, the prosecutor must advise the court\nthat reasonable efforts were made to confer with the victim about the plea and the victim's view regarding it. 174\nThe rule proposed here is narrower than these state formulations: it requires only that a prosecutor confer with the victim about\nthe plea and inform the court if the victim objects. For many significant categories of federal cases (e.g., typical drug\ntrafficking offenses, felons in possession of a firearm, etc.), there will be no victim, much less a victim objection. In such cases,\nto require some sort of victim inquiry by the court or victim certification by the prosecutor would unnecessarily waste time.\nThe proposed rule requires only that the prosecutor report a victim's objection - in which case the court will presumably want to\nmore carefully consider whether to accept a plea.\nRule 12.1 - Victim Addresses and Phone Numbers Not Disclosed for Alibi Purposes\nThe Proposal:\nThe Government currently must disclose the address and telephone numbers of any witnesses, including the victim, that it\nplans to use to disprove an alibi. This rule should be changed to protect the victim's privacy, excluding their information from\nthis requirement.\n(b) Disclosing Government Witnesses.\n(1) Disclosure. If the defendant serves a Rule 12.1(a)(2) notice [regarding intent to present an alibi defense], an attorney for the\ngovernment must disclose in writing to the defendant or the defendant's attorney:\n(A) the name, address, and telephone number of each witness and the address and telephone number of each witness (other than\na victim) that the government intends [*873] to rely on to establish the defendant's presence at the scene of the alleged\noffense; and\n(B) each government rebuttal witness to the defendant's alibi defense\n… .\n(c) Continuing Duty to Disclose. Both an attorney for the government and the defendant must promptly disclose in writing to\nthe other party the name of each additional witness, and the address and telephone number of each additional witness (other\nthan a victim) if:\n(1) the disclosing party learns of the witness before or during trial; and\n(2) the witness should have been disclosed under Rule 12.1(a) or (b) if the disclosing party had known of the witness earlier.\nIn addition, a similar change should be made to Rule 12.3 regarding the addresses and telephone numbers of victims who will\nbe used to disprove a public-authority defense.\nThe Rationale:\nThis proposed change implements the victim's right to be \"reasonably protected from the accused.\" 175 The victim cannot be\nreasonably protected if the defendant, without good reason, is given the victim's address and telephone number. The proposed\nrule strikes the current requirement that the prosecutor must automatically give the defendant the victim's address and telephone\n173\nSee id.\n174\nAriz. Rev. Stat. Ann. 13-4423(b)(1) (2001).\n175\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(1) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *873\nPage 23 of 52\nnumber even without any showing of need. Nothing in the rule, however, would bar the defendant from requesting that\ninformation by filing an appropriate motion. The court could then determine whether any such motion had merit. 176\n[*874]\nRule 15 - Victims' Right To Attend Pre-Trial Depositions\nThe Proposal:\nRule 15 should allow victims to attend any public deposition in a case as follows:\n(i) Victims Can Attend. A Victim can attend any public deposition taken under this rule under the same conditions as govern a\nvictim's attendance at trial.\nThe Rationale:\nVictims have the right \"not to be excluded from any … public court proceeding,\" except in rare cases where their testimony\nwill be materially affected. 177 Depositions authorized by Rule 15 are for the purpose of preserving evidence for trial, 178 and\nthus are effectively an extension of the trial. Victims accordingly have the right to attend such proceedings, if public, under the\nsame conditions governing their attendance at trial. To avoid any confusion over this issue, the proposed rule change directly\nstates that conclusion.\nBecause victims can be excluded from the trial in certain rare situations where their testimony would be materially affected,\n179 they can likewise be excluded from a deposition in those situations. The proposed rule simply applies the limitations on\nattending trial to the deposition setting by providing that the \"same conditions\" apply to the victim's attendance at the\ndeposition.\n[*875]\nRule 17 - Victims' Right to Notice of Subpoena of Confidential Information\nThe Proposal:\nRule 17 regarding subpoenas should be modified to give victims notice before personal or confidential information is\nsubpoenaed and to allow victims to file a motion to quash such a subpoena as follows:\n(h)(2) Victim Information. After indictment, no record or document containing personal or confidential information about a\nvictim may be subpoenaed without a finding by the court that the information is relevant to trial and that compliance appears to\nbe reasonable. If the court makes such a finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the attorney for the\ngovernment or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court may quash or\nmodify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.\nThe Rationale:\nThe existing rules governing subpoenas are flawed because they allow the parties to subpoena personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim from third parties without the victim's knowledge. This issue arose recently in the Utah state\n176\nCf. United States v. Wills, 88 F.3d 704, 709-10 (9th Cir. 1996) (allowing delayed disclosure of alibi witness because witness feared for\nsafety and defendant had violent history and allowing ex parte hearing because of need to keep identity of witness from the defendant).\n177\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(3).\n178\nSee, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d 419, 437 (10th Cir. 1995).\n179\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(3), discussed infra notes 276-308 and accompanying text.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *875\nPage 24 of 52\ncriminal proceedings involving the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart. Elizabeth was kidnapped from her home in Salt Lake City,\nUtah. She was found nearly nine months later with a local transient and his wife, who had taken Elizabeth at knifepoint. 180\nAttorneys for Elizabeth's alleged kidnapper subpoenaed class records from her high school - class and teacher lists, report\ncards, and disciplinary and attendance records - and medical records from her hospital. 181 While the hospital refused to turn\nover the requested records, the school willingly turned over the requested records without notice to the Smart family.\nElizabeth's father learned about the subpoena only after her school records had already been turned over to defense counsel.\nThe Smart family [*876] attorney then filed a motion to return the records to the school. Prosecutors in the case have objected\nto the fact that they were not given an opportunity to file a motion to quash. 182 The matter is still under review in state court.\nThe problem that occurred in the Smart case under the Utah rules could also occur under the federal rules. 183 The federal rules\ncurrently allow the witness to whom the subpoena is issued to object, 184 but there is no provision for notifying the victim\nwhen personal or confidential information has been subpoenaed from another witness.\nServing such subpoenas without notice to the victim violates the provisions of the CVRA guaranteeing victims the rights to be\ntreated \"with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy\" and \"with fairness.\" 185 Allowing subpoenas to go directly to thirdparty\ncustodians of records can fail to protect privacy if the custodian is disinterested or disinclined to protect the victim's\nprivacy. Such a scenario is not far-fetched; a third party who is subpoenaed will often have no interest in incurring legal fees to\nprotect a victim's rights. Even if interested, third parties may not fully understand the sensitive nature of certain victim\ninformation. Victims may also have important statutory rights to protect. In the Elizabeth Smart case, for example, the school\nmay have violated the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act by turning over private information about Elizabeth. 186\nSubpoenas served without notice to victims may also raise constitutional concerns. 187 It is well settled that a right to privacy\nis implicitly incorporated within the protections guaranteed under the [*877] United States Constitution. The Supreme Court\n\"has recognized that a right of personal privacy, or a guarantee of certain areas or zones of privacy, does exist under the\nConstitution.\" 188 Supreme Court precedent establishes two lines of privacy interests: (1) the \"individual interest in avoiding\ndisclosure of personal matters\" and (2) \"the interest in independence in making certain kinds of important decisions.\" 189 In\nessence, the right to privacy includes an individual's interest in making certain decisions that fundamentally affect his or her\nperson \"free from unwarranted governmental intrusion.\" 190 In light of interests such as these, several courts have held that\ncrime victims' records - such as rape crisis counseling records - are not subject to subpoena. 191\n180\nSee generally Ed Smart & Lois Smart with Laura Morton, Bringing Elizabeth Home: A Journey of Faith and Hope (2003).\n181\nStephen Hunt, Defense Blasted for Obtaining Smart's School Records, Salt Lake Trib., Jan. 14, 2005, at B2.\n182\nPat Reavy, Quash Smart Subpoenas, DA Says, Deseret Morning News, Feb. 1, 2005, at B3.\n183\nSee Letter from Gregory G.

Rev. 835, *877\nPage 25 of 52\nThe proposed new rule protects victims' statutory and potential constitutional interests in two ways. First, the court is required\nto make a preliminary determination that the subpoena seeks information relevant at trial and that compliance appears to be\nreasonable. This is consistent with the trial court's existing power to quash unreasonable subpoenas, including subpoenas\ndirected at crime victims. 192 Second, if the court makes a preliminary determination that the subpoena is appropriate, the\nvictim would then receive notice of the subpoena. To avoid harassment, the notice would be provided either through the\nvictim's own attorney or, more commonly, through the prosecutor.\nThe proposed rule makes no substantive change in the right of the party to obtain appropriate information through a subpoena.\nInstead, it merely changes procedures to ensure victims are treated fairly by having the opportunity to file a motion to quash\nwhere such [*878] a motion is appropriate. The court is then authorized to grant the victim's motion to quash under the same\nstandards that already apply to other motions to quash - where compliance would be \"unreasonable or oppressive.\" 193\nThe proposed change does not interfere with the legitimate interests of the government or defendants. The change will not\nhamper government investigations because it applies only to subpoenas issued after indictment. Before indictment, a victim's\nprivacy is protected through grand jury secrecy. After indictment, the only legitimate purpose for a subpoena by either the\ngovernment or the defendant is to obtain testimony or evidence for trial or similar court hearing. Rule 17 does not permit a\nsubpoena for discovery purposes, 194 although upon a proper showing a party can obtain pre-trial access to materials. 195\nTherefore, when challenged by a victim on a motion to quash, the party seeking the evidence will prevail upon a proper\nshowing that the subpoena is appropriate. The only change made by the rule, then, is to require preliminary screening by the\ncourt when confidential information is involved and give the victim the opportunity for court review in cases where legitimate\ninterests are at stake. Constitutional interests in privacy and the victim's right to be treated \"with fairness\" require nothing less.\nRule 18 - Victims' Interests Considered in Setting Place of Prosecution\nThe Proposal:\nRule 18 should be amended to require the court to consider the convenience of victims in setting the place of prosecution as\nfollows:\nUnless a statute or these rules permit otherwise, the government must prosecute an offense in a district where the offense was\ncommitted. The court must set the place of trial within the district with due regard for the convenience of the defendant, any\nvictim, and the witnesses, and the prompt administration of justice.\n[*879]\nThe Rationale:\n191\nSee, e.g., State ex rel. Romley v. Superior Courts, 836 P.2d 445, 451-52 (Ariz. Ct. App. 1992) (crime victim had the right to deny\ndefendant access to medical records); Commonwealth v.

Rev. 835, *879\nPage 26 of 52\nThis change helps to implement a victim's right under the CVRA to be treated \"with fairness.\" 196 The rule change is modest.\nRule 18 already requires the court to consider the convenience of the \"witnesses\" in a case. In many cases, of course, the victim\nwill be a witness. But for clarity in those cases, and to account for cases in which the victim will not be a witness, the rule\nshould be amended to refer specifically to victims.\nRule 20 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Consensual Transfer\nThe Proposal:\nRule 20 should be amended to allow the court to consider the victims' views in any decision to transfer a case as follows:\n(a) Consent to Transfer. A prosecution may be transferred from the district where the indictment or information is pending, or\nfrom which a warrant on a complaint has been issued, to the district where the defendant is arrested, held, or present if:\n(1) the defendant states in writing a wish to plead guilty or nolo contendere and to waive trial in the district where the\nindictment, information, or complaint is pending, consents in writing to the court's disposing of the case in the transferee\ndistrict, and files the statement in the transferee district; and\n(2) the United States attorneys in both districts approve the transfer in writing after consultation with any victim. If any victim\nobjects to the transfer, the United States attorney in the transferring district or the victim's attorney shall advise the court where\nthe indictment or information is pending of the victim's concerns.\nA similar change should be made to Rule 20(d) regarding transfer of juvenile proceedings.\n[*880]\nThe Rationale:\nAs with the previous proposal, this change implements the victim's right under the CVRA to be \"treated with fairness.\" 197\nThe procedure for transferring a case for a plea is not constitutionally required, but rather is designed for the convenience of the\ndefendant and the government. 198 In considering whether such administrative reasons justify a transfer, the concerns of the\nvictim appropriately enter into the balance. For reasons similar to those discussed above in connection with changes regarding\nplea procedures, the prosecution would be directed to confer with the victim and to advise the court of any objection to the\ntransfer. 199\nRule 21 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Transfer for Prejudice\nThe Proposal:\nRule 21 should be amended as follows to require consideration of the victim's interest in whether a case should be transferred:\n(e) Victims' Views. The court shall not transfer any proceeding without giving any victim an opportunity to be heard. The court\nshall consider the views of the victim in making any transfer decision.\nThe Rationale:\nRule 21 authorizes the trial judge to transfer a case to avoid prejudice or for the convenience of the parties. The proposed rule\nwould require that the court consider the victim's concerns in making any such transfer decision. Such consideration would\nseem to be part and parcel of protecting the victim's right to be \"treated with fairness.\" In addition, the vicinage provision of\n196\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(8) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n197\nId. 3771(a)(8).\n198\nSee generally Wright, Federal Practice and Procedure 321, at 357-58.\n199\nSee supra notes 158-174 and accompanying text.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *880\nPage 27 of 52\nArticle III and the public's First Amendment right of access to trials give constitutional dimensions to the victim's interest in\ntransfer decisions.\n[*881] Victims may have compelling interests in observing the trial in their local community. 200 Traveling to a remote\nlocation to watch the trial may be financially difficult for many victims and impossible for indigent victims. Moreover, forcing\nvictims to travel to distant communities alone may deprive them of the accompaniment and support of family and friends,\nwhich may be especially important when observing emotionally charged court proceedings.\nDefendants, too, have the right to have cases tried locally. Under the Sixth Amendment, \"in all criminal prosecutions, the\naccused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall\nhave been committed … .\" 201 This right might be viewed as the defendant's to assert or waive as circumstances dictate. For\nfederal cases, however, the vicinage right is not exclusively placed in the hands of the defendant. Instead, Article III provides\nthat \"the Trial of all Crimes, except in Cases of Impeachment, shall be by Jury; and such Trial shall be held in the State where\nthe said Crimes have been committed.\" 202\nThis difference in language supports the reading that the federal provision is a structural guarantee designed to protect broader\ninterests than the defendant's alone. 203 Moreover, the provision provides for trial in the state where the crime was committed.\nIn most cases, this state would be where the victim resided; whether the defendant also resided in that state would be incidental.\nAn understanding of the Article III provision as protecting the community's interest is bolstered by the Supreme Court's\ndecisions on right of public access to trials. In cases such as Richmond Newspapers, Inc. v. Virginia, 204 the Court has held\nthat a guarantee of the public's right to attend trials is implicit in the First Amendment. Compelling victims' interests underlie\nthis guarantee. As the Court has explained, \"the presence of interested spectators [*882] may keep [the defendant's] triers\nkeenly alive to a sense of their responsibility and to the importance of their functions.\" 205 In addition, \"public proceedings\nvindicate the concerns of the victims and the community in knowing that offenders are being brought to account for their\ncriminal conduct.\" 206 As Justice Blackmun has emphasized, \"The victim of the crime, the family of the victim, [and] others\nwho have suffered similarly … have an interest in observing the course of a prosecution.\" 207 Victims are vitally interested in\nobserving criminal trials because society has withdrawn \"both from the victim and the vigilante the enforcement of criminal\nlaws, but [it] cannot erase from people's consciousness the fundamental, natural yearning to see justice done - or even the urge\nfor retribution.\" 208 To be sure, transferring a trial to a distant city may not flatly violate the public right of access to a trial, but\nit can surely burden the rights of the public, including the victim, which suggests that victims ought to be heard before any such\ndecision is made.\nThe Article III vicinage provision and the public right of access to trials provide constitutional underpinnings for construing the\nvictim's rights under the CVRA to include a right to be heard on transfer proceedings. In addition, Congress has mandated that\n200\nSee generally Beloof, Cassell & Twist, supra note 15, 392-99 (reviewing case law on the victim's interest in venue decisions).\n201\nU.S. Const. amend.

Rev. 835, *882\nPage 28 of 52\nvictims be treated with fairness. This is a broad provision intended to be broadly construed and to give victims a right to due\nprocess. As Senator Kyl has stated,\nThe broad rights articulated in this section are meant to be rights themselves and are not intended to just be aspirational. One of\nthese rights is the right to be treated with fairness. Of course, fairness includes the notion of due process. Too often victims of\ncrime experience a secondary victimization at the hands of the criminal justice system. This provision is intended to direct\nGovernment agencies and employees, whether they are in executive or judicial branches, to treat victims of crime with the\nrespect they deserve and to afford them due process. 209\n[*883] Clearly, Congress intended to afford crime victims a broad right to due process in criminal proceedings. Due process,\nof course, uncontroversially includes a right to be heard. 210 Thus, victims should be heard before the court makes a transfer\ndecision.\nConcluding that victims have a right to be heard on transfer decision does not mean, of course, that they will dictate the transfer\ndecision. In some cases, the defendant will be able to establish sufficiently pervasive prejudice in a particular community to\nentitle him to a change of venue to protect his constitutional rights. 211 But the limited point here is that victims may provide\nan important perspective that the judge ought to consider in reaching a decision. Moreover, even if the judge decides to transfer\na case, the victims may have valuable information for the judge on where to transfer the case to (e.g., to an adjacent state rather\nthan a distant one).\nAn illustration of the general approach of the proposed rule comes from State v. Timmendequas, 212 a capital case decided by\nthe New Jersey Supreme Court. In Timmendequas, the trial judge imported a jury from a distant community rather than force\nthe family of a murdered young girl to travel to another district. Construing New Jersey state law provisions similar to the\nCVRA's, the New Jersey Supreme Court explained that the trial judge properly considered the views of the victim's family:\nOver the past decade, both nationwide and in New Jersey, a significant amount of legislation has been passed implementing\nincreased levels of protection for victims of crime. Specifically, in New Jersey, the Legislature enacted the \"Crime Victim's Bill\nof Rights.\" That amendment marked the culmination of the Legislature's efforts to increase the participation of crime victims in\nthe criminal justice system.\n[*884]\nThe purpose of the Victim's Rights Amendment was to \"enhance and protect the necessary role of crime victims and witnesses\nin the criminal justice process. In furtherance of [that goal], the improved treatment of these persons should be assured through\nthe establishment of specific rights.\" One of the enumerated rights guaranteed for victims is \"to have inconveniences associated\nwith participation in the criminal justice process minimized to the fullest extent possible.\"\n… .\n… The [trial] court explicitly stated that it was not favoring the rights of the victims over those of defendant. Rather, it was\nsimply taking their concerns into consideration, as it had not done previously. Taking the concerns of the victim's family into\n209\n150 Cong. Rec. S10,910-11 (daily ed.

Therefore, Rule 21 should be amended to allow victims to provide information to the judge on\ntransfer decisions.\nRule 23 - Victims' Views Considered Regarding Non-Jury Trial\nThe Proposal:\nThe court should be required to consider the views of victims before allowing waiver of a jury trial as follows:\nRule 23. Jury or Nonjury Trial\n(a) Jury Trial. If the defendant is entitled to a jury trial, the trial must be by jury unless:\n(1) the defendant waives a jury trial in writing;\n(2) the government consents; and\n(3) the court approves after considering the views of any victims.\n[*885]\nThe Rationale:\nIn the federal courts the \"preferred\" trial method is a jury trial. 214 As Justice Blackmun has explained, the public has interests,\nindependent of a criminal defendant, in monitoring judges, police, and prosecutors - and in being educated about \"the manner\nin which criminal justice is administered.\" 215 Nonetheless, the Supreme Court has concluded that defendants can waive their\nright to a jury trial. 216 To help protect the general public interest in trial by jury, Rule 23 requires not only prosecutor approval\n217 but also judicial approval before proceeding by way of bench trial. This approval requires careful weighing of the\ncompeting concerns. The Supreme Court has instructed that\n213\nId. at 76 (internal citations omitted).

Rev. 835, *885\nPage 30 of 52\nthe duty of the trial court [in considering whether to approve a jury trial waiver] is not to be discharged as a mere matter of rote,\nbut with sound and advised discretion, with an eye to avoid unreasonable or undue departures from that mode of trial or from\nany of the essential elements thereof, and with a caution increasing in degree as the offenses dealt with increase in gravity. 218\nThis is a \"serious and weighty responsibility.\" 219\n[*886] To discharge that serious and weighty responsibility, the trial court should receive as much information as possible.\nThe victim is often well situated to provide information about how the public will view a non-jury trial. The proposed rule\nchange takes the modest step of requiring the court to hear the victim before approving any non-jury trial, a step that is\nconsistent with the CVRA's command that victims be treated with fairness.\nImportantly, this change would not interfere with defendants' rights. The Supreme Court has squarely held that the defendant\nlacks any constitutional right to unilaterally elect a bench trial. 220 Of course, in some circumstances, despite a victim's\nobjection, a non-jury trial nonetheless will be appropriate. Moreover, in extreme cases, the defendant may have a right to a nonjury\ntrial where pretrial publicity has pervasively tainted the jury pool. 221 Nothing in the proposed rule change would interfere\nwith a court's right to approve a bench trial in such circumstances, so long as the court considers the victim's perspective as part\nof the approval process.\nRule 32(a) - Deleting Old Definition of \"Victim\"\nThe Proposal:\nThe definition of \"victim\" currently contained in Rule 32 should be stricken as follows:\nRule 32. Sentencing and Judgment\n(a) Definitions. The following definitions apply under this rule:\n(1) \"Crime of violence or sexual abuse\" means:\n(A) a crime that involves the use, attempted use, or threatened use of physical force against another's person or property; or\n(B) a crime under 18 U.S.C. 2241-2248 or 2251-2257.\n[*887]\n(2) \"Victim\" means an individual against whom the defendant committed an offense for which the court will impose sentence.\nThe Rationale:\nThe old definition of victim in Rule 32 is now too narrow, as it is limited to crimes of violence or sexual abuse. The CVRA, in\ncontrast, includes all victims within its protections. In the proposed new rules, \"victim\" would be defined in Rule 1. 222\nAccordingly, the narrower definition found here can simply be eliminated.

The probation officer must conduct a presentence investigation and submit a report to the court before it\nimposes sentence unless:\n(i) 18 U.S.C. 3593(c) or another statute requires otherwise; or\n(ii) the court finds that the information in the record enables it to meaningfully exercise its sentencing authority under 18 U.S.C.\n3553, and the court explains its finding on the record.\n[*888]\n(B) Restitution. If the law requires permits restitution, the probation officer must conduct an investigation and submit a report\nthat contains sufficient information for the court to order restitution.\nThe Rationale:\nAs currently written, the rule directs that a presentence report contain information about restitution only when the law\n\"requires\" restitution. The proposed amendment directs that all presentence reports contain appropriate restitution information\nwhenever the law \"permits\" restitution. If the law permits restitution, the court ought to receive information sufficient to allow\nit to determine whether to order such restitution. Only with such knowledge can the court appropriately exercise its discretion.\nIn most cases, restitution is covered by one of two federal statutes: the Mandatory Victims Restitution Act of 1996 (MVRA),\n224 and its predecessor, the Victim and Witness Protection Act of 1982 (VWPA). 225 For all crimes of violence and certain\ncrimes against property, the MVRA firmly directs that \"notwithstanding any other provision of law, when sentencing a\ndefendant convicted of [certain offenses such as crimes of violence] … the court shall order … that the defendant make\nrestitution to the victim of the offense or, if the victim is deceased, to the victim's estate.\" 226 For other crimes, the earlier\nVWPA controls. It permits the court to order restitution in its discretion after considering various relevant factors. 227\n223\nSee Letter from Ed Carnes, Chair of the Advisory Comm. on Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure, to Hon. David F. Levi, Chair of the\nStanding Committee on Rules of Practice and Procedure (May 18, 2004) (on file with the author) (noting that proposed expansion of Rule 32\nshould be withdrawn if the CVRA was passed).\n224\n18 U.S.C. 3663A, 3664 (2000).\n225\nId. 3663, 3664.

Rev. 835, *888\nPage 32 of 52\nIn its current form, Rule 32(c)(1)(B) suggests that the probation officer is required to include restitution information only in a\ncase covered by the MVRA because only then is restitution (in the language of the current rule) \"required.\" 228 No sound\nreason exists [*889] for such a limitation, particularly after the enactment of the CVRA. The CVRA guarantees that victims\nhave \"the right to full and timely restitution as provided in law.\" 229 Even when the court is proceeding under the discretionary\nVWPA, without appropriate information in the presentence report, the court cannot determine whether to exercise its discretion\nto award restitution. Therefore, the rule should be changed to require that the presentence report contain restitution information,\nfrom which the court can determine whether to make a restitution award.\n(New) Rule 32(c)(3) - Probation Officer To Seek Out Victim Information\nThe Proposal:\nThe probation officer preparing a presentence report should be directed to determine whether a victim wishes to provide\ninformation for the report as follows:\n(3) Victim Information. The probation officer must determine whether any victim wishes to provide information for the\npresentence report.\nThe Rationale:\nUnder the CVRA, the victim has \"the right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving …\nsentencing … .\" 230 This right clearly encompasses the victim's right to allocate, or make an oral statement at sentencing, as\ndiscussed below in connection with Rule 32(i). 231 However, the right to be \"reasonably heard\" also appears to include the\nopportunity to provide information to the probation office during preparation of the presentence report.\nAs Senator Kyl explained, the victim's right to be heard at sentencing should be broadly construed:\n[*890]\n[The CVRA] provides victims the right to reasonably be heard at any public proceeding involving … sentencing. This provision\nis intended to allow crime victims to directly address the court in person. It is not necessary for the victim to obtain the\npermission of either party to do so … . When a victim invokes this right during … sentencing proceedings, it is intended that …\nhe or she be allowed to provide all three types of victim impact: the character of the victim, the impact of the crime on the\nvictim, the victims' family and the community, and sentencing recommendations … .\nIt is not the intent of the term \"reasonably\" in the phrase \"to be reasonably heard\" to provide any excuse for denying a victim\nthe right to appear in person and directly address the court. Indeed, the very purpose of this section is to allow the victim to\nappear personally and directly address the court. This section would fail in its intent if courts determined that written, rather\nthan oral communication, could generally satisfy this right. On the other hand, the term \"reasonably\" is meant to allow for\nalternative methods of communicating a victim's views to the court when the victim is unable to attend the proceedings. Such\ncircumstances might arise, for example, if the victim is incarcerated on unrelated matters at the time of the proceedings or if a\nvictim cannot afford to travel to a courthouse. In such cases, communication by the victim to the court is permitted by other\nreasonable means. 232\nIn light of this legislative history, victims undoubtedly have a right to make an in-court statement at sentencing as part of their\nright \"to be heard.\" But they also have the right to communicate in other ways with the court. At sentencing, an obvious\n228\nFed. R. Crim.

Rev. 835, *890\nPage 33 of 52\nalternative way is via the probation officer. If there is any doubt about whether the right \"to be heard\" covers communications\nto the probation officer, the right \"to be treated with fairness\" comfortably covers such a requirement.\nThe proposed rule requires that the probation office affirmatively seek out the victim. It is unlikely that a probation officer\ncould properly prepare a thorough presentence report without obtaining the victim's views. Indeed, the rules already require the\nofficer to include victim information in the report. 233 Because there is no way [*891] to know in advance whether the victim\nwill have relevant information for the report, the probation officer should be required to investigate that possibility. Of course,\nnothing in the proposed rule change would require the probation officer to include irrelevant or argumentative information in\nthe report.\nRule 32(d)(2)(B) - Presentence Report To Contain Victim Information\nThe Proposal:\nRule 32(d)(2)(B) should be amended to refer directly to victims in describing the content of the presentence report and to\nconform to the style used for information about defendants as follows:\n(2) Additional Information. The presentence report must also contain the following information:\n(A) the defendant's history and characteristics, including:\n(i) any prior criminal record;\n(ii) the defendant's financial condition; and\n(iii) any circumstances affecting the defendant's behavior that may be helpful in imposing sentence or in correctional treatment;\n(B) verified information, stated in a nonargumentative style, that assesses the financial, social, psychological, and medical\nimpact on any individual against whom the offense has been committed any victim of the crime …\nThe Rationale:\nAs discussed at the outset of this article, 234 Rule 32(d)(2)(B) typifies the victim's absence from the current federal rules by\nfailing to use the word \"victim\" in describing what information belongs in a presentence report. In addition, the rule should be\namended to conform to the style used in describing the presentence report's information about the defendant. The rule dealing\nwith the [*892] defendant's background 235 contains no requirement that information be \"verified\" or stated in a \"nonargumentative\nstyle.\" As a matter of even-handedness, no such requirement should be listed for victim information. Of course,\nwell-trained federal probation officers will no doubt attempt to verify all information in the presentence report and phrase all of\nthe report in a non-argumentative style. The peculiarity in the current rule is that, among the numerous subjects covered by the\nrules, the verification and non-argumentative style requirements apply to victim information alone.\nRule 32(e) - Prosecutor To Disclose Presentence Report to Victim\nThe Proposal:\nThe prosecutor should be required to disclose relevant parts of the presentence report to victims as follows:\n(e) Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.\n233\nSee supra notes 10-13 and accompanying text (discussing Rule 32(d)(2)(B)).\n234\nSee supra notes 10-13 and accompanying text.\n235\nFed.

Unless the defendant has consented in writing, the probation officer must not submit a presentence report\nto the court or disclose its contents to anyone until the defendant has pleaded guilty or nolo contendere, or has been found\nguilty.\n(2) Minimum Required Notice. The probation officer must give the presentence report to the defendant, the defendant's\nattorney, and an attorney for the government at least 35 days before sentencing unless the defendant waives this minimum\nperiod. The attorney for the government shall, if any victim requests, communicate the relevant contents of the presentence\nreport to the victim.\nThe Rationale:\nThe presentence report plays a critical role in the federal sentencing process. The report contains information about the crime,\nthe background of the defendant, the impact of the crime on the victim, and other matters relevant to sentencing. Most\nimportant, the report also contains a calculation under the Federal [*893] Sentencing Guidelines specifying a range for any\nrecommended prison sentence (e.g., forty-six to fifty-seven months). While judges need not slavishly impose a sentence within\nthis range, 236 most trial judges give significant weight to the Guidelines calculation, 237 and appellate courts have\ndiscouraged straying too far from the Guidelines without good reason. 238\nThe CVRA entitles victims to be heard on disputed Guidelines issues and, as a corollary, entitles them to the right to review\nparts of the presentence report relevant to those issues. The CVRA gives victims \"the right to be reasonably heard at any public\nproceeding in the district court involving … sentencing … .\" 239 This codifies the right of crime victims to provide what is\nknown as a \"victim impact statement\" to the court. 240 The victim's right to be heard, however, is not narrowly circumscribed\nto just impact information. To the contrary, the right conferred is a broad one - to be \"reasonably heard\" at the sentencing\nproceeding.\nThe victim's right to be \"reasonably heard\" is best understood as giving the victim the opportunity to speak about disputed\nissues regarding the Sentencing Guidelines calculation. As Senator Kyl explained, the right to be heard includes the right to\nmake sentencing recommendations:\nWhen a victim invokes this right [to be heard] during … sentencing proceedings, it is intended that the [sic] he or she be\nallowed to provide all three types of victim impact [information]: the character of the victim, [*894] the impact of the crime\non the victim, the victim's family and the community, and sentencing recommendations. 241\nA \"sentencing recommendation\" will often directly implicate Guidelines issues. For example, if the victim wishes to\nrecommend a hundred-month sentence when the maximum guideline range is only fifty-seven months, that sentencing\nrecommendation is essentially meaningless unless a victim can provide a basis for recalculating the Guidelines or departing or\nvarying from them. 242\n236\nSee United States v. Booker, 125 S. Ct. 738 (2005).\n237\nSee, e.g., United States v. Wilson, 350 F. Supp. 2d 910, 912 (D.

Rev. 835, *894\nPage 35 of 52\nBecause a victim has the right to be heard on a Guidelines issue, a victim also has the right to see the document which contains\nthe Guidelines calculations - the presentence report. 243 Congress intended the victim's right to be heard to be construed\nbroadly, as Senator Feinstein stated: \"The victim of crime, or their counsel, should be able to provide any information, as well\nas their opinion, directly to the court concerning the … sentencing of the accused.\" 244 It is hard to see how victims can\nmeaningfully provide \"any information\" that would have a bearing on the sentence without being informed of the Guidelines\ncalculations that likely will drive the sentence and reviewing the document that underlies those calculations.\nAn independent basis for victims reviewing presentence reports is within the victim's broad right under the CVRA to be\n\"treated with fairness.\" 245 This right easily encompasses a right of access to relevant parts of the presentence report. The\nvictim's right to fairness gives victims a free-standing right to due process. As Senator Kyl instructed, \"Of course, fairness\nincludes the notion of due process … . [*895] This provision is intended to direct government agencies and employees,\nwhether they are in the executive or judicial branches, to treat victims of crime with the respect they deserve and to afford them\ndue process.\" 246 Due process principles dictate that victims have the right to be apprised of Guidelines calculations and\nrelated issues. The Supreme Court has explained that \"it is … fundamental that the right to … an opportunity to be heard \"must\nbe granted at a meaningful time and in a meaningful manner.'\" 247 It is not \"meaningful\" for victims to make sentencing\nrecommendations without the benefit of knowing what everyone else in that courtroom knows: the recommended Guidelines\nrange and how that range was derived. Congress plainly intended to pass a law establishing \"fair play for crime victims,\nmeaningful participation of crime victims in the justice system, [and] protection against a government that would take from a\ncrime victim the dignity of due process.\" 248 In federal sentencing today, meaningful participation means participation\nregarding Guidelines issues.\nIt is interesting that the federal law allowing appointment of a guardian ad litem for juvenile victims appears to allow for access\nto the presentence report. The law guarantees that, upon appointment, a guardian ad litem \"may have access to all reports,\nevaluations and records, except attorney's work product, necessary to effectively advocate for the child.\" 249 In a recent federal\n\"shaken baby\" case in Arizona, a guardian for the child victim received access to the presentence report under this provision.\n250 The guardian in that case found it exceedingly difficult to formulate an appropriate sentencing recommendation without\naccess to the presentence report. After successfully gaining access to the report, she found a need to change her original\nrecommendation. She later reported that \"but for the [*896] disclosure, I would have ended up making a mis-informed\nrecommendation.\" 251\nA victim's right to review the presentence report is also important to ensure proper restitution. Federal law guarantees most\nvictims of serious crimes the right to restitution. 252 Reinforcing those laws, the CVRA guarantees that victims have \"the right\n243\nMagistrate Judge Orenstein of the Eastern District of New York, who has written many thoughtful opinions on the CVRA, has taken a\ncontrary position.

Sept. 7, 2005) (\"In the\nabsence of any change to applicable rules or the Guidelines, the court is under no legal obligation to ensure such disclosure\" of the\npresentence report.).

Rev. 835, *896\nPage 36 of 52\nto full and timely restitution as provided in law.\" 253 As a practical matter, many of the calculations supporting a restitution\naward will rest on information in the presentence report. While the restitution statutes have their own detailed procedural\nprovisions, 254 the presentence report is clearly a central part of the restitution process. If a presentence report fails to\naccurately recount restitution figures, crime victims may be short-changed. For all these reasons, the CVRA should be\nunderstood as giving victims the right to review relevant parts of the presentence report and to be heard before a court makes\nany final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing issues. Many states follow a similar approach and\ngive victims access to the presentence report. 255\nIn February 2005, I testified before the Sentencing Commission to recommend a change in the U.S. Sentencing Commission\nGuidelines Manual along the lines of the proposals contained in this [*897] Article. 256 In particular, I suggested that the\nCommission change its current rule, which allows only the parties to see the presentence report. 257 The Practitioners'\nAdvisory Group to the Sentencing Commission later disputed my proposal. In a letter to the Commission, 258 they argued that\n\"nothing in the CVRA or its legislative history states that crime victims should be permitted to review portions of the\npresentence report, dispute guidelines calculations, raise grounds for departure, or, as such rights would seem to imply, appeal a\nsentence on factual or legal grounds.\" 259 The Practitioners' Group also cited the drafting history of the proposed constitutional\namendment protecting victims' rights, which they thought was limited to giving a victim merely the right to \"allocute\" at\nsentencing - that is, merely to provide victim impact information. 260\nThe Practitioners' Group's arguments are flawed for several reasons. First, the Group too narrowly views the relevant legislative\nhistory of the CVRA. As explained above, Congress intended for victims to have broad rights in the sentencing process,\nincluding rights to be reasonably heard in a meaningful manner. 261 It is not reasonable to deprive victims of the critical\ninformation in the presentence report. Second, the Practioners' Group inaccurately describes the relevant history of the Victims'\nRights Amendment. It is true that the proposed constitutional amendment contained a right to be \"reasonably heard,\" just as the\nCVRA does. However, the Practitioner's Group fails to recognize that the legislative history of the amendment suggests that\n253\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(6) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n254\n18 U.S.C. 3664.\n255\nAla.

Rev. 835, *897\nPage 37 of 52\nCongress was taking an expansive view of the victim's right to be heard at sentencing, including a view that [*898] would\nembrace a victim's right to make a specific sentencing recommendation. 262\nMost important, the Practitioners' Group's letter fails to consider the impact of denying the victim access to the presentence\nreport on the victim's right to fairness. Presumably the Group, comprised primarily of defense attorneys, would be outraged if\ndefendants were sentenced without receiving notice about relevant parts of the presentence report, because of the defendant's\ndue process rights. But victims now also have due process rights during sentencing, which make it clear that they should\nreceive the same information.\nThe Practitioners' Group raises one concern that can be readily dispelled. The Group wonders whether a victim's right to be\nheard on Guidelines issues implies a general right to appeal a sentence. It would not. The CVRA contains its own specific\nremedial provision, which permits victims to appeal only denials of their rights. 263 It specifically allows a victim to file a\nmotion \"to re-open … a sentence\" only for violations of the victim's \"right to be heard.\" 264 Moreover, while victims possess\ndue process protections, due process does not guarantee a right to an appeal. 265 Finally, the Sentencing Reform Act spells out\nthe limited rights of appeal on Guidelines issues available to only the government and the defense. 266 For all these reasons,\nvictims have the right to review relevant parts of the [*899] presentence report and to be heard on Guidelines issues in the trial\ncourt, but if the court properly hears them on the Guidelines issues, victims would not have the right to appeal the sentence the\ncourt ultimately imposes.\nBecause victims have a right of access to the presentence report, the question arises of how to provide that access. Nothing in\ncurrent law precludes releasing presentence reports to victims. While 18 U.S.C. 3552 requires disclosure to government and\ndefense counsel, it does not forbid further dissemination. Several federal courts have held that circulation of reports to third\nparties is proper on a showing of particularized need approved by the court. 267 Some courts' local rules also allow additional\ndistribution with court approval. 268 Victims always have a particularized need for access to the Guidelines calculations and\n261\nSee supra notes 239-44 and accompanying text.\n262\nThe Group cites a 2000 Senate Judiciary Committee Report regarding the Victims' Rights Amendment, which referenced a Tenth Circuit\ndecision restricting the right of victims to present a sentencing recommendation. See Letter from Amy Baron-Evans, supra note 258 (citing S.\nRep. No. 106-254, at 12 (2000) (discussing Robinson v. Maynard, 943 F.2d 1216 (10th Cir. 1991))). By 2003, however, the same passage in\nthe Senate Judiciary Committee Report was changed to remove the citation to that case and instead to cite a leading proponent of expansive\nrights for victims to give judges specific sentencing recommendations:\nVictim impact statements concerning the character of the victim and the impact of the crime remain constitutional. See Douglas E. Beloof,\nConstitutional Implications of Crime Victims as Participants, 88 Cornell L. Rev. 282 (2003). The Committee does not intend to alter or\ncomment on laws existing in some States allowing for victim opinion as to the proper sentence.\nS. Rep. No. 108-191, at 38 (2003). It is hard to see anything in this history suggesting that Congress wanted victims to be deprived of the\nchance to review presentence reports.\n263\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(5) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).

Rev. 835, *899\nPage 38 of 52\nrelated parts of the presentence report; without such access they are unable to effectively make their sentencing\nrecommendation.\nIn view of that legal landscape, there are three ways in which the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure might deal with\ndisclosure of the presentence reports to victims:\n(1) Complete Disclosure. The rules could direct full disclosure of the presentence report to the victim. While no statute bars this\napproach, legitimate policy objections might be raised. Some reports may contain sensitive private information about the\ndefendant such as results of psychiatric examinations, prior history of drug use, or childhood sexual abuse. Some reports may\nalso reveal confidential law enforcement information that should not be widely circulated. Victims may not always need access\nto these parts of the report. While a number of states give victims unfettered right to access the presentence report, 269 a more\nlimited approach seems appropriate in the federal system.\n[*900] (2) Selective Disclosure. The rules could direct that the probation office redact any presentence report to remove\nconfidential information and then provide the redacted report to the victim. This approach, too, is problematic; it would require\nconsiderable work by busy probation officers to prepare an additional document - a redacted report - presumably only after\nconsulting with the attorneys on both sides of the case about what might be viewed as confidential.\n(3) Disclosure through Prosecutors. The simplest solution to the competing concerns is to disclose the report to victims through\nan intermediary: the prosecutor. The prosecutor would serve as the filter for confidential information and assist the victim by\nhighlighting critical parts of the report. Opponents might object that this approach would burden prosecutors, who are no less\nbusy than probation officers. But the CVRA already gives victims the right to \"confer\" with prosecutors, 270 and presumably\nthey will confer regarding the important topic of sentencing. Moreover, many U.S. Attorney's Offices already have Victim-\nWitness Coordinators who communicate with victims regarding impact statements. The CVRA also authorizes increased\nfunding of $ 22 million for the Victim-Witness Assistance Programs in U.S. Attorney's Offices, presumably enabling those\noffices to expand their victim services. 271\nIt might be burdensome to require that prosecutors disclose presentence reports to victims in all cases, even when they are not\ninterested in such disclosure. Accordingly, disclosure of the report should be required only upon request of a victim.\nFor all those reasons, the Commission should amend the rules to give requesting victims access to presentence reports through\nthe prosecutor. In addition, some of the aspects of preparing and disclosing presentence reports are covered in Chapter 6.A of\nthe United States Sentencing Guidelines Manual. 272 The Manual falls within the jurisdiction of the U.S. Sentencing\nCommission. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee on Criminal Rules should [*901] coordinate with the Commission to\nensure that any changes in the Criminal Rules are consistent with the provisions of the Manual.\nRule 32(f), (h), (i) - Victim Opportunity To Object to Presentence Report\nThe Proposal:\nRule 32(f), (h), and (i) should be amended to allow the victim to object to the presentence report as follows:\n(f) Objecting to the Report.\n(1) Time To Object. Within 14 days after receiving the presentence report, the parties must state in writing any objections,\nincluding objections to material information, sentencing guideline ranges, and policy statements contained in or omitted from\nthe report. The attorney for the government or for the victim shall raise for the victim any reasonable objection by the victim to\nthe presentence report.\n269\nSee supra note 255.\n270\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(5) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n271\nSee 118 Stat. 2260, 2264 (2004).\n272\nSee supra note 257 and accompanying text.\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *901\nPage 39 of 52\n(2) Serving Objections. An objecting party must provide a copy of its objections to the opposing party and to the probation\nofficer.\n(3) Action on Objections. After receiving objections, the probation officer may meet with the parties and the victim to discuss\nthe objections. The probation officer may then investigate further and revise the presentence report as appropriate.\n… .\n(h) Notice of Possible Departure from Sentencing Guidelines. Before the court may depart from the applicable sentencing\nrange on a ground not identified for departure either in the presentence report or in a party's prehearing submission or in a\nvictim impact statement, the court must give the parties reasonable notice that it is contemplating such a departure. The notice\nmust specify any ground on which the court is contemplating a departure. The attorney for the government or for the victim\nshall advise defense counsel and the court of any ground identified by the victim that might reasonably serve as a basis for\ndeparture.\n(i) Sentencing.\n[*902]\n(1) In General. At sentencing, the court:\n(A) must verify that the defendant and the defendant's attorney have read and discussed the presentence report and any\naddendum to the report;\n(B) must give to the defendant and an attorney for the government a written summary of - or summarize in camera - any\ninformation excluded from the presentence report under Rule 32(d)(3) on which the court will rely in sentencing, and give them\na reasonable opportunity to comment on that information;\n(C) must allow the parties' attorneys and any victims to comment on the probation officer's determinations and other matters\nrelating to an appropriate sentence; and\n(D) may, for good cause, allow a party or any victim to make a new objection at any time before sentence is imposed.\n(2) Introducing Evidence; Producing a Statement. The court may permit the parties or the victim to introduce evidence on the\nobjections. If a witness testifies at sentencing, Rule 26.2(a)-(d) and (f) applies. If a party fails to comply with a Rule 26.2 order\nto produce a witness's statement, the court must not consider that witness's testimony.\n(3) Court Determinations. At sentencing, the court:\n(A) may accept any undisputed portion of the presentence report as a finding of fact;\n(B) must - for any disputed portion of the presentence report or other controverted matter - rule on the dispute or determine that\na ruling is unnecessary either because the matter will not affect sentencing, or because the court will not consider the matter in\nsentencing; and\n(C) must append a copy of the court's determinations under this rule to any copy of the presentence report made available to the\nBureau of Prisons.\nThe Rationale:\nFor the reasons explained in the preceding section, the victim's right to be \"reasonably heard\" at a sentencing hearing\nencompasses the right to be heard on Sentencing Guidelines issues. Congress [*903] intended that the victim become a\nparticipant in the process with rights \"independent of the Government or the defendant.\" 273 Those independent rights include\n273\n150 Cong. Rec. S4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *903\nPage 40 of 52\nthe opportunity to make \"sentencing recommendations.\" 274 Given that matters in the presentence report may often determine\nwhat effect a sentencing recommendation will have, the victim's right presumably extends to participating in the process that\ndetermines the Guideline range.\nThe changes in Rule 32 noted above simply incorporate the victim in the Guidelines process. Changing the rule in this fashion\nwould also clarify the appropriate sequencing of sentencing hearings. Rule 32(i) already allows the victim to submit \"any\ninformation\" about the sentencing. 275 Yet if the experience in my court is any guide, the victim's allocution frequently occurs\nonly after the court has decided all the issues surrounding the presentence report. For the victim's right to provide information\nto the court to truly have meaning, the victim's information must be presented early enough to potentially affect critical\nsentencing issues, including issues about Guidelines calculations.\nAs with the changes discussed in the previous section, changes in the Sentencing Guidelines Manual are also required here. The\nAdvisory Committee also should coordinate with the Sentencing Commission to ensure that its actions are consistent.\nRule 32(i)(4) - Conforming Amendment to Victims' Right To Be Heard\nThe Proposal:\nRule 32(i)(4) should be amended to conform the definition of victim to that found in the CVRA as follows:\n(B) By a Victim. Before imposing sentence, the court must address any victim of a the crime of violence or sexual abuse who is\npresent at sentencing and must permit the victim to speak or submit any information about the sentence. Whether or not the\nvictim is [*904] present, a victim's right to address the court may be exercised by the following persons if present:\n(i) a parent or legal guardian, if the victim is younger than 18 years or is incompetent; or\n(ii) one or more family members or relatives the court designates, if the victim is deceased or incapacitated.\nThe Rationale:\nAs noted earlier, 276 Rule 32 currently contains a definition of \"victim\" that is narrower than the CVRA's definition. The\nsimplest fix is simply to strike the definition of victim and victim's representative here and include an appropriate definition in\nRule 1.\n(New) Rule 43.1 - Victim's Right To Attend Trials\nThe Proposal:\nA new rule implementing the victim's right to be present at trials and other proceedings should be added as follows:\nRule 43.1 Victim's Presence\n(a) Victim's Right To Attend. A victim has the right to attend any public court proceeding, unless the court, after receiving clear\nand convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other\ntestimony at that proceeding. Before making any determination to exclude a victim, the court shall make every effort to permit\nthe fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the exclusion of the victim from the\ncriminal proceeding. The reasons for any decision to exclude a victim shall be clearly stated on the record.\n(b) Proceeding With and Without Notice. The court may proceed with a public proceeding without a victim if proper notice has\nbeen provided to that victim under Rule 10.1. The court may proceed with a public proceeding (other than a trial or sentencing)\n274\nId.\n275\nFed. R. Crim. P. 32(i)(4)(B).\n276\nSee discussion supra notes 120-27, 220-23 and accompanying text discussing Rules 1 and 32(a).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *904\nPage 41 of 52\n[*905] without proper notice to a victim only if doing so is in the interest of justice, the court provides prompt notice to that\nvictim of the court's action and of the victim's right to seek reconsideration of the action if a victim's right is affected, and the\ncourt ensures that notice will be properly provided to that victim for all subsequent public proceedings.\n(c) Numerous Victims. If the court finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the right\nto be present, the court shall fashion a reasonable procedure to facilitate victims' attendance.\n(d) Right To Be Heard on Victims' Issues. In addition to rights to be heard established elsewhere in these rules, at any public\nproceeding at which a victim has the right to attend, the victim has the right to be heard on any matter directly affecting a\nvictim's right.\nThe Rationale:\nThe rules should reflect the CVRA's command that victims have the right to attend public proceedings in all but the most\nunusual circumstances. The CVRA guarantees victims the right to attend a proceeding \"unless the court, after receiving clear\nand convincing evidence, determines that testimony by the victim would be materially altered if the victim heard other\ntestimony at that proceeding.\" 277 This is a fundamental right for victims. A crime is often a very significant event in the life of\na victim, and the trial, too, may be extremely important. Victims deserve to see in person whether justice is being done and\nshould be exempted from the rule requiring trial witnesses to sit outside the courtroom. 278 The CVRA adopts this approach by\nallowing crime victims, in the vast majority of cases, to attend the hearings and trial of the case involving their victimization.\nThis is so important because crime victims share an interest with the [*906] government in seeing that justice is done in a\ncriminal case and this interest supports the idea that victims should not be excluded from public criminal proceedings, whether\nthese are pretrial, trial, or post-trial proceedings. 279\nMost states have also adopted language affirming a victim's right to attend court proceedings, including the trial. 280\nOne way of addressing the victim's right to attend would be to leave the matter to the Federal Rules of Evidence. Federal Rule\nof Evidence 615 - the so-called \"rule on witnesses\" - requires exclusion of witnesses with certain exceptions, including the\nfourth exception for \"a person authorized by statute to be present.\" 281 This exception was added to cover crime victims, 282\n277\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(3) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n278\nSee generally President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, Final Report 80 (1982) (urging that victims be able to attend trial); Douglas E.\nBeloof & Paul G. Cassell, The Victim's Right To Attend the Trial: The Reascendant National Consensus, 9 Lewis & Clark L. Rev. 481 (2005)\n(developing this argument at length).\n279\n150 Cong. Rec. S4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n280\nSee, e.g., Ariz. Const. art. II, 2.1(A) (\"To preserve and protect victims' rights to justice and due process, a victim of crime has a right: …\nto be present at and, upon request, to be informed of all criminal proceedings where the defendant has the right to be present.\"); Colo. Const.\nart. II, 16a (\"Any person who is a victim of a criminal act, or such person's designee, legal guardian, or surviving immediate family members\nif such person is deceased, shall have the right to be heard when relevant, informed, and present at all critical stages of the criminal justice\nprocess.\" (emphasis added)); Idaho Const. art.

Rev. 835, *906\nPage 42 of 52\nwho had a right to attend trials subject to certain conditions even before the passage of the CVRA. 283 Without the explicit\nlisting of this exception, some trial courts simply overlooked the victim's right to attend - most notoriously in the Oklahoma\nCity bombing trial. 284\n[*907] Merely relying on Rule 615 to protect the victim's right to attend proceedings, however, would be inadequate. First, the\ndefendant's right to attend proceedings is deemed sufficiently important to merit treatment in a specific rule in the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure - Rule 43. This proposed victim's rule, Rule 43.1, would even-handedly mirror that treatment for\nvictims.\nSecond, Federal Rule of Evidence 615 does not comprehensively address the victim's right to attend proceedings. For starters, it\nwould seem that the Advisory Committee Notes in the Federal Rules of Evidence now need a revision to reference the CVRA.\nOtherwise, judges, prosecutors, and defense counsel might simply be unaware that a victim is now \"authorized by statute\" - the\nCVRA - to be present. 285 Even if legal professionals realize the CVRA's ramifications, most crime victims are not lawyers and\nlack experience in the criminal justice system. Therefore, their rights need to be laid out in the most direct manner possible by\nlisting their right to attend any public court proceeding in the criminal rules.\nFinally, providing the details of the victim's right to attend is important for practical reasons. The CVRA qualifies the victim's\nright to attend by requiring exclusion in those rare cases when the victim's testimony \"would be materially altered if the victim\nheard other testimony at that proceeding.\" 286 The CVRA, however, contains additional procedural requirements that judges\nmust follow before excluding a victim in such situations: \"Before making a determination … [to exclude a victim], the court\nshall make every effort to permit the fullest attendance possible by the victim and shall consider reasonable alternatives to the\nexclusion of the victim from the criminal proceeding.\" 287 Presumably, these reasonable alternatives include having the victim\ntestify first and then watching all the following witnesses testify, 288 something judges are authorized to require. 289 The Act\nalso requires that \"the reasons for any decision denying relief under this chapter shall be clearly stated on [*908] the record.\"\n290 These procedural requirements are new and potentially complex. Moreover, issues surrounding victim attendance at\ncriminal proceedings are likely to occur frequently. Victims can appeal any exclusion order, and appellate courts must take up\nthose appeals expeditiously. 291 Accordingly, it is important that lawyers, judges, and victims have the new rule and its\nprocedural requirements at their fingertips, rather than being forced to dig it out through some cross-reference to the United\nStates Code. For all these reasons, subsection (a) of the proposed rule simply tracks verbatim the substantive and procedural\nrequirements of the CVRA.\nProposed Rule 43.1(a) also limits the victim's right to attend \"public\" proceedings. It is clear that the CVRA intended to make\nno change in the circumstances in which proceedings could be closed to the public. As Senators Kyl and Feinstein explained in\na colloquy regarding the law: \"The Government or the defendant can request, and the court can order, judicial proceedings to\n282\nSee Fed. R.

This provision [of the CVRA] is not intended to alter those laws or their procedures in any way\n… .\" 292\nProposed Rule 43.1(b) turns to the potentially complex subject of whether the court may go forward with a proceeding when\nthe victim is not present. Of course, if the victim has been properly notified but has elected not to attend the proceeding, no\nproblem arises. The difficult issue is what to do when the victim is absent because of lack of notice of the proceeding. It could\nbe argued that the court has no choice but to reschedule such a proceeding, just as it would be required to reschedule a\nproceeding when the defendant had not received notice. The CVRA mandates that courts \"shall ensure\" that crime victims are\naccorded their rights, 293 and one of the rights is notice for court proceedings. 294 If the victim has not received notice of a\nproceeding, then going forward with the proceeding arguably violates the victim's rights under the CVRA. As Senator Kyl\nexplained:\n[*909]\nIt does not make sense to enact victims' rights that are rendered useless because the victim never knew of the proceeding at\nwhich the right had to be asserted. Simply put, a failure to provide notice of proceedings at which a right can be asserted is\nequivalent to a violation of the right itself. 295\nProposed Rule 43.1(b) stakes out a position more limited than an absolute requirement of proper victim notification. Except for\ntrials and sentencings (which are discussed below), proposed Rule 43.1(b) would allow the court to move forward with a\nproceeding without notice to the victim provided that three conditions are met: (1) doing so is in the interests of justice, (2) the\ncourt provides prompt notice to the victim of the court's action and of the victim's right to seek reconsideration of the action if a\nvictim's right is affected, and (3) the court ensures that notice will be properly provided to the victim for all subsequent public\nproceedings.\nEach of these three conditions serves an important purpose. To begin with, the court should not go forward unless the interests\nof justice are served - the first requirement. The court should also notify the victim of the opportunity to seek reconsideration of\nthe court's action if a victim's right is affected - the second requirement. For example, if the court holds a bail hearing without\nproper notice to the victim and decides to release a defendant, the victim should be advised of this fact and of the right to ask\nthe court to reconsider that bail decision. (The CVRA, as noted earlier, gives victims the right to provide information regarding\nbail decisions. 296 ) Finally, if the court is moving forward without proper notice to a victim at a particular proceeding, it seems\nonly fair that the problem be solved for future proceedings - the third requirement.\nFor two important proceedings - trial and sentencing - the proposed rule would bar a court from moving forward without proper\nnotice to the victim. This is consistent with the CVRA's directive that \"in any court proceeding involving an offense against a\ncrime victim, the court shall ensure that the crime victim is afforded the rights [in the CVRA].\" 297 If the victim has not been\nnotified of a [*910] trial or sentencing, the only way the court can \"ensure\" that the victim's right is protected is to delay the\ntrial or sentencing until the victim receives notice. This is entirely appropriate; a victim of a crime deserves the opportunity to\nsee the trial of her victimizer and to speak at sentencing. A modest delay in these proceedings is a small price to pay for\nrespecting the victim's rights. Moreover, neither a trial nor a sentencing can be repeated.

Many federal cases lack a specifically identifiable victim (e.g., drug and\nimmigration offenses) and thus are not covered by the CVRA. In those cases with a victim, a significant percentage of victims\nmay waive any right to receive notice. In cases where victims choose to receive notice, presumably the notice will be properly\ngiven the vast majority of the time. Even apart from notice requirements, most victims will be trial witnesses and therefore will\nhave been notified of the trial by a subpoena. Victims will also often be aware of sentencings through the work of probation\nofficers in preparing presentence reports. 302 In the tiny fraction of cases where notice has not been properly provided, notice\nwill often be only a [*911] telephone call away. While the burdens of delaying a trial or sentencing are not trivial, Congress\nhas determined that the victim's rights must take precedence. Proposed subsection (b) faithfully implements that determination.\nSubsection (c) of the proposed rule deals with the victim's right to attend in situations involving multiple victims. Congress has\nrecognized that in some cases, such as the Oklahoma City bombing case, it is impossible to afford all victims the opportunity to\nattend trials. Accordingly, the CVRA provides that where \"the number of crime victims makes it impracticable\" to protect\nrights for all victims, the court \"shall fashion a reasonable procedure\" to give effect to victims' interests. 303 Possible\nprocedures include closed-circuit transmission of the proceedings to a ceremonial courtroom, auditorium, or other facility that\ncan accommodate many people. To permit such transmission, an amendment to Rule 53 is proposed below. 304\nSubsection (d) gives victims a general right to be heard on issues \"directly affecting\" their rights. The CVRA specifically\nmandates that victims have the right to be heard with regard to release of the defendant, a plea, or a sentence. 305 The right to\nbe heard at these hearings has been addressed elsewhere in these proposed rules, 306 but courts will sometimes consider other\nissues that directly affect victims' rights. For example, courts may consider whether to release the address and telephone\nnumber of the victim to the defendant. 307 It makes little sense for the court to decide this issue without hearing from the\nvictim, particularly since the CVRA gives victims the right \"to be reasonably protected from the accused.\" 308 Subsection (d)\n298\nSee U.S. Const. amend.

After all, the CVRA\nguarantees victims the right to be \"treated with fairness\" and fairness can be understood as embracing the assistance of counsel.\n309 But on closer examination, it becomes clear that nothing in the CVRA directly mandates counsel for victims. As Senator\nKyl explained, \"This bill does not provide victims with a right to counsel but recognizes that a victim may enlist counsel on\ntheir own.\" 310\nWhile the CVRA does not require judges to appoint counsel for victims, nothing in it prevents judges from doing so in\nappropriate cases, particularly under prevailing case law demonstrating that federal courts have inherent authority to make such\nappointments. Because this authority may not be well known to judges (or to victims), the authority should be clearly laid out\nin the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nA number of federal courts have recognized inherent judicial authority to appoint lawyers for indigent litigants in both civil and\ncriminal cases. 311 While these cases do not directly involve [*913] appointment of counsel for crime victims, their principles\n309\nCf. Gideon v. Wainwright, 372 U.S. 335, 344 (1963) (discussing \"fairness\" to the defendant as a reason for recognizing a right to\nappointed counsel).\n310\n150 Cong. Rec. S4268 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl).\n311\nSee, e.g., Powell v. Alabama, 287 U.S. 45, 73 (1932) (holding, in a capital case, that courts have the power to appoint counsel and that\n\"attorneys are officers of the court, and are bound to render service when required by such an appointment\"); United States v. Bertoli, 994\nF.2d 1002, 1015-18 (3d Cir. 1993) (holding that the court has inherent power to order defendant's retained law firm to remain as standby\ncounsel at a criminal trial when defendant elects to represent himself pro se); United States v. Accetturo, 842 F.2d 1408, 1412-16 (3d Cir.\n1988) (holding that courts have inherent power to appoint counsel during a criminal trial proceeding but that the power does not extend to\nappointing lawyers licensed in other states); United States v. Bowe, 698 F.2d 560, 566-67 (2d Cir. 1983) (noting that a court has inherent\nauthority to appoint counsel for an indigent witness who may incriminate herself during testimony in a criminal case); Williamson v.\nVardeman, 674 F.2d 1211, 1212-16 (8th Cir. 1982) (upholding a state court judge's appointment of pro bono counsel in criminal case as\nconstitutional although noting that forcing an attorney to advance his own funds may be unconstitutional); Tyler v. Lark, 472 F.2d 1077, 1079\n(8th Cir. 1973) (noting that in civil rights cases, \"representation of indigents upon court order has been a traditional obligation of the lawyer\nwhich he assumes when he becomes a member of the bar\"); Dolan v. United States, 351 F.2d 671, 672 (5th Cir. 1965) (holding, in a criminal\ncase, that lawyers implicitly consent to be appointed by courts pro bono when accepting a license to practice law); United States v. Dillon,\n346 F.2d 633, 635-36 (9th Cir. 1965) (holding, in a criminal case, that there is \"an obligation on the part of the legal profession to represent\nindigents upon court order, without compensation\"). But cf. Colbert v. Rickmon, 747 F. Supp. 518, 527 (W.D. Ark. 1990) (holding that courts\nhave no inherent power to order attorneys to represent indigent clients). See generally Jerry L. Anderson, Court-Appointed Counsel: The\nConstitutionality of Uncompensated Conscription, 3 Geo. J.

Illustrative of these decisions is the thoughtful analysis by the U.S. District Court for the District of\nNebraska in Bothwell v. Republic Tobacco Co. 312 Bothwell presented four grounds for its holding that courts have inherent\npower to appoint attorneys to represent indigent litigants:\n1) courts possess the inherent power to bring to their assistance those \"instruments\" necessary to ensure a \"fair and just\"\nadjudicative process in individual cases; 2) in many, if not most, cases, due to the adversarial nature of our system, lawyers are\na necessary component in ensuring such a \"fair and just\" process; 3) to a significant degree, neither the private marketplace nor\npublic or charitable efforts provide indigent litigants with adequate access to legal assistance; and 4) to that extent, such failure\nthreatens the reliability of the results of the adversarial process. 313\nThese grounds readily apply to appointing attorneys for indigent victims when important rights under the CVRA are at stake.\nWithout [*914] an attorney to press her claims, a victim may be unable to obtain a \"fair and just\" adjudicative process. 314\nMoreover, crime victim representation appears to be a prime example of a situation where \"neither the private marketplace nor\npublic or charitable efforts provide indigent litigants with adequate access to legal assistance.\" 315 No financial incentive will\ndrive lawyers to represent victims in criminal cases. 316 And while pro bono representation for victims is expanding, 317 it still\nfalls far short of the needs of victims in the federal system. The fourth and final requirement - that the failure of attorneys to\nrepresent the indigent client threatens the reliability of the system - is also present where rights under the CVRA are at stake.\nNeither the prosecutor nor the defendant has a personal stake in the victim's rights, and, frequently, they will have other\npriorities and interests that may even be adverse to the rights of the victim. 318 Accordingly, courts have inherent authority to\nappoint counsel to represent indigent victims and, indeed, may even be able to require [*915] counsel to serve without\ncompensation. 319 The local rules of some federal courts already explicitly recognize this power. 320\nIn addition to this inherent authority, federal courts appear to possess statutory authority to make such an appointment. Title 28\nbroadly permits the court in both civil and criminal cases to \"request an attorney to represent any person unable to afford\ncounsel.\" 321 Moreover, at least one statute already directly authorizes federal courts to appoint counsel for child victims in\nZelin, Court Appointment of Attorney To Represent, Without Compensation, Indigent in Civil Action, 52 A.L.R. 4th 1063 (1987 & Supp.\n2004).\n312\n912 F.

Gillis & Douglas Beloof, The Next Step for a Maturing Victim Rights Movement: Enforcing Crime Victim Rights\nin the Courts, 33 McGeorge L. Rev. 689, 692 (2002).\n315\nBothwell, 912 F.

U.S. Dist. Court, 490 U.S. 296, 307 & n.8 (1989) (leaving open the question of whether federal courts possess the inherent\nauthority to require counsel to provide legal services to the poor). Several lower courts have concluded that appointment without\ncompensation is proper. See Bothwell, 912 F. Supp. at 1230-34 (counsel have a duty to serve without compensation); Family Division Trial\nLawyers of the Superior Court-D.C. v. Moultrie, 725 F.2d 695, 705 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (rejecting argument that pro bono appointment violates\nthe Thirteenth Amendment because attorneys can take steps to avoid the pro bono appointments and holding that pro bono court\nappointments are not per se \"takings,\" as accepting court ordered representation of indigents is a condition of receiving a law license, but\nexcessive burden could present takings problem); Williamson v. Vardeman, 674 F.2d 1211, 1211 (8th Cir. 1982) (noting that pro bono\nservice is a voluntary obligation undertaken by attorneys when they apply for a license to practice law); Tyler v. Lark, 472 F.2d 1077, 1079-\n80 (8th Cir. 1973) (no takings problem with appointment); United States v. Dillon, 346 F.2d 633, 635-36 (9th Cir. 1965) (no taking problems\nwith appointment). But see State ex rel. Scott v. Roper, 688 S.W.2d 757, 759-70 (Mo. 1985) (questioning power of courts to appoint counsel\nwithout providing compensation).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *915\nPage 47 of 52\ncertain cases. Title 18 U.S.C. 3509 provides, \"The court may appoint a guardian ad litem for a child who was a victim of, or a\nwitness to, a crime involving abuse or exploitation to protect the best interests of the child.\" Congress, however, has not yet\nprovided funding for this particular right. 322 Finally, in unusual circumstances where a crime victim may also face possible\ncriminal charges of his or her own, the Criminal Justice Act would authorize appointment of and payment for defense counsel.\n323\nProposed Rule 44.1 would confirm the existing discretionary power of the courts to appoint volunteer counsel. The rule is\npurely discretionary (the court \"may\" appoint counsel) and is limited to [*916] situations where the interests of justice require\nappointment. The rule does not address payment for counsel, as this matter must be left to subsequent appropriations from\nCongress. The court, however, can ask for volunteer counsel to assist victims on a pro bono basis.\nThere is reason to expect that some attorneys will volunteer. Not only are many attorneys willing to undertake pro bono\nrepresentation, but the CVRA itself authorizes millions of dollars in funding for victim representation around the country. The\nauthorization includes support for the National Crime Victims Law Institute at the Northwestern School of Law at Lewis and\nClark College to help establish eleven legal offices around the country representing crime victims. 324\nFinally, it might be argued that it is unnecessary to address this subject in a rule because the court's inherent authority to\nappoint counsel exists even without a rule. Both courts and victims, however, will find it useful to have this authority spelled\nout in the criminal rules to eliminate any lingering doubt. In addition, the CVRA obliges prosecutors to eliminate any lingering\ndoubt in the event of any material conflict of interest between the prosecutor and the victim by \"advising the crime victim that\nthe crime victim can seek the advice of an attorney.\" 325 This requirement may frequently require prosecutors to help victims\nobtain legal counsel. Accordingly, a separate rule on this subject is appropriate.\nFor all these reasons, the rules should be amended to recognize the court's authority to appoint volunteer counsel to represent a\ncrime victim.\n[*917]\nRule 46 - Victims' Right To Be Heard Regarding Defendant's Release from Custody\nThe Proposal:\nVictims should be explicitly given the right to be heard regarding the defendant's release from custody as follows:\n(k) Victims' Right To Be Heard. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any decision to release the defendant. The court\nshall consider the views of victims in making any release decision, including such decisions in petty cases. In a case where the\ncourt finds that the number of victims makes it impracticable to accord all of the victims the right to be heard in open court, the\ncourt shall fashion a reasonable procedure to facilitate hearing from representative victims.\nThe Rationale:\n320\nSee, e.g., D. Utah Civ. R. 83-1.1(b)(3) (1997) (\"Any attorney who is admitted to the bar of this court must agree, as a condition of such\nadmission, to engage in a reasonable level of pro bono work when requested to do so by the court.\").\n321\n28 U.S.C. 1915(e)(1) (2000) (emphasis added).\n322\nMemorandum from the Administrative Office of the United States Courts to the United States District Court Judges and the United States\nMagistrate Judges (March 19, 1991) (available from the Administrative Office).\n323\nSee 18 U.S.C. 3006A(a)(1).\n324\nSee 42 U.S.C. 10603(d) (2000); see also 150 Cong. Rec. S4266 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Kyl) (noting appropriations\nfor the National Crime Victims Law Institution \"to provide grants and assistance to lawyers to help victims of crime in court\" with funding\nsufficient to \"provide for two new regional offices and nine specific clinics\"). For more information on NCVLI, see http://www.ncvli.org.\n325\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(c)(2) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *917\nPage 48 of 52\nThe CVRA guarantees victims the right \"to be reasonably heard\" at \"any public proceeding … involving release.\" 326 A\nsimilar right already exists for victims of stalking offenses. 327 This proposed rule simply recognizes a victim's right \"to be\nreasonably heard\" and further directs the court to consider the victim's input. The victim's right to be heard would be\nmeaningless if the court did not consider the victim's views. Moreover, existing law appears to recognize that the court should\nconsider the victim's concerns. 328\nRule 48 - Victims' Views on Dismissal To Be Considered\nThe Proposal:\nThe court should be required to consider the views of victims in deciding whether to grant a government motion to dismiss\ncharges as follows:\n[*918]\nRule 48. Dismissal\n(a) By the Government. The government may, with leave of court, dismiss an indictment, information, or complaint. The\ngovernment may not dismiss the prosecution during trial without the defendant's consent. In deciding whether to grant the\ngovernment's motion to dismiss, the court shall consider the views of any victims.\nThe Rationale:\nThis proposed change would implement a victim's right to be \"treated with fairness\" and to be heard at any proceeding\n\"involving release\" of the defendant by requiring the court to consider the views of the victim before granting a government\nmotion to dismiss a charge. The rule already requires leave of court before a dismissal can be approved. In determining whether\nto grant leave, the court should consider whether dismissal is \"clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\" 329 Among the\nrelevant factors in making this public interest determination is whether the prosecution's motion to dismiss is motivated by\n\"animus towards the victim.\" 330 The proposed rule would simply require the court to consider the views of the victim in\nmaking this determination, leaving the weight to afford those views up to the court.\nRule 50 - Victims' Right to Proceedings Free from Unreasonable Delay\nThe Proposal:\nA victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay should be recognized as follows:\nRule 50. Prompt Disposition\n(a) Scheduling Preference. Scheduling preference must be given to criminal proceedings as far as practicable.\n[*919]\n(b) Defendant's Right Against Delay. The court shall assure that the defendant's right to a speedy trial is protected, as provided\nby the Speedy Trial Act.\n326\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(4).\n327\n18 U.S.C. 2263.\n328\nSee, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 3142(c) (court to consider whether release of the defendant \"will endanger the safety of any other person\").\n329\nUnited States v. Cowan, 524 F.2d 504, 513 (5th Cir. 1975).\n330\nIn re Richards, 213 F.3d 773, 787 (3d Cir. 2000).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *919\nPage 49 of 52\n(c) Victim's Right Against Delay. The court shall assure that a victim's right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay is\nprotected. A victim has the right to be heard regarding any motion to continue any proceeding. If the court grants a motion to\ncontinue over the objection of a victim, the court shall state its reasons in the record.\nThe Rationale:\nUnder the CVRA, a victim has a right \"to proceedings free from unreasonable delay.\" 331 A number of states have similar\nprovisions. 332\n[*920] The proposed rule would give effect to this right. Of course, in some situations, delay is reasonable. In others,\nhowever, the court should deny a motion to continue in order to wrap up the proceedings and possibly bring closure to a victim.\nAs Senator Feinstein has explained,\nThis provision does not curtail the government's need for reasonable time to organize and prosecute its case. Nor is the\nprovision intended to infringe on the defendant's due process right to prepare a defense. Too often, however, delays in criminal\nproceedings occur for the mere convenience of the parties and those delays reach beyond the time needed for defendant's due\nprocess or the government's need to prepare. The result of such delays is that victims cannot begin to put the crime behind them\nand they continue to be victimized. It is not right to hold crime victims under the stress and pressure of future court proceedings\nmerely because it is convenient for the parties or the court. 333\nThe proposed rule gives victims a right against unreasonable delay in subsection (c). To ensure that defendants' rights are\nreasonably protected, a new subsection (b) is added recognizing defendants' rights in the Speedy Trial Act. 334 The existing\nrule's direction to give scheduling preference to criminal cases would remain in subsection (a).\nThe proposal also gives victims the right to be heard on any continuance. This is consistent with the drafters' intent, as at least\none court has already opined. 335 As Senator Kyl stated, \"This provision [in the CVRA] should be interpreted so that any\n331\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(a)(7). Even before the adoption of the CVRA, child victims had the right to a \"speedy trial\" in certain situations. 18\nU.S.C. 3509(j).\n332\nSee, e.g., Ariz. Rev.

Penal Code 1050(a) (2005) (stating policy of the California legislation that\n\"excessive continuances … cause substantial hardship to victims and other witnesses … .

Code Ann. tit. 11, 9423 (2001) (\"In\nruling on any motion or other request for a delay or continuance … the court shall consider and give weight to any adverse impact such delay\nor continuance might have on the well-being of any victim … .\"); 730 Ill. Comp. Stat.

Code 40-38-116(a)\n(2003) (\"In any criminal proceeding in which a continuance is requested, the court shall consider the victim's views and the victim's right to a\nspeedy trial.

Stat. Ann. 1-40-207 (2004) (\"The court shall consider the victim's interest\nand circumstances when … granting or denying continuances.\").\nSome states limit speedy trial rights to child victims. See, e.g., Ala. Code 15-25-6 (2000) (\"In ruling on any motion … for … continuance …\nthe court shall consider and give weight to any adverse impact the delay or continuance may have on the well-being of a child victim or\nwitness.\"); Del.

Rec. S4268-69 (daily ed. Apr. 22, 2004) (statement of Sen. Feinstein).\nDAVID SCHOEN\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *920\nPage 50 of 52\ndecision to schedule, reschedule, or continue criminal cases should include victim input through the victim's assertion of the\nright to be free from unreasonable delay.\" 336\n[*921] The proposed rule also requires that the court state its reason for granting any continuance. This requirement stems\nfrom a recommendation from the President's Task Force on Victims of Crime, which noted \"the inherent human tendency to\npostpone matters, often for insufficient reason,\" and accordingly recommended that \"reasons for any granted continuance … be\nclearly stated on the record.\" 337 Several states have adopted similar provisions. 338\nRule 51 - Claiming Error Regarding Victims' Rights\nThe Proposal:\nThe procedures for a victim to assert error should be spelled out in the rules as follows:\nRule 51. Preserving Claimed Error\n(a) Exceptions Unnecessary. Exceptions to rulings or orders of the court are unnecessary.\n(b) Preserving a Claim of Error. A party or a victim may preserve a claim of error by informing the court - when the court\nruling or order is made or sought - of the action the party wishes the court to take, or the party's objection to the court's action\nand the grounds for that objection. If a party or a victim does not have an opportunity to object to a ruling or order, the absence\nof an objection does not later prejudice that party. A ruling or order that admits or excludes evidence is governed by Federal\nRule of Evidence 103.\nThe Rationale:\nThe CVRA authorizes victim appeals and includes procedures for expedited handling of those appeals. 339 The proposed rule\nwould [*922] incorporate victims into the existing rule regarding preservation of errors.\nRule 53 - Closed-Circuit Transmission of Proceedings for Victims\nThe Proposal:\nClosed-circuit transmission of court proceedings for victims should be authorized as follows:\nRule 53.

Rev. 835, *922\nPage 51 of 52\n(b) Closed-Circuit Transmission for Victims. In order to permit victims of crime to watch criminal trial proceedings, the court\nmay authorize closed-circuit televising of the proceedings for viewing by victims or other persons the court determines have a\ncompelling interest in doing so.\nThe Rationale:\nThe CVRA grants victims the right to attend trials, as noted previously in connection with proposed Rule 43.1. 340 At the same\ntime, however, the CVRA recognizes that in situations with numerous victims, the court may have to craft \"a reasonable\nprocedure\" to protect victims' rights. 341 One such reasonable procedure would appear to be closed-circuit transmission of\ncourt proceedings to a facility sufficiently large to accommodate all the victims. This was the procedure followed in the\nOklahoma City bombing case. 342\n[*923] The proposed rule would authorize such transmission in appropriate cases. The language for the proposed rule comes\nfrom 42 U.S.C. 10608(a), which authorizes closed-circuit transmissions \"notwithstanding any provision of the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure to the contrary\" in cases in which a proceeding has been transferred more than 350 miles - as was the case\nwith the Oklahoma City bombing trial. In light of the CVRA's mandate that the court must always craft \"a reasonable\nprocedure\" to protect the rights of multiple victims, there is no compelling reason to tie the device to such geographical\ncircumstances. The proposed rule authorizes courts to allow such transmissions in any appropriate case.\nRule 58 - Victims and Petty Offenses\nThe Proposal:\nCourts should hear from victims regarding sentences in petty cases as follows:\nRule 58. Petty Offenses and Other Misdemeanors.\n…\n(3) Sentencing. The court must give the defendant an opportunity to be heard in mitigation and then proceed immediately to\nsentencing. The court must also give victims an opportunity to be heard. The court may, however, postpone sentencing to allow\nthe probation service to investigate or to permit either party to submit additional information.\nThe Rationale:\nThe CVRA gives a \"victim\" the right to be heard at sentencing. The CVRA defines \"victim\" as including anyone who is\ndirectly and proximately harmed by \"a Federal offense.\" 343 The Act does not limit those offenses to felonies or\nmisdemeanors. Accordingly, a victim has a right to be heard at sentencing for any petty offense, as would be reflected in the\nproposed rule.\n[*924]\nConclusion\nThe CVRA commands that victims be made participants in the federal criminal process and thus requires significant changes to\nthe Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure. This Article has provided one possible and comprehensive way to implement that\ncongressional command with specific language and supporting analysis for each change. Undoubtedly there are other ways of\n340\nSee supra notes 277-308 and accompanying text.\n341\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771(d)(2).\n342\nSee Paul G. Cassell & Robert F.

However, since the Advisory Committee will be making many decisions about how to best change\nthe rules, one concluding thought may be worth highlighting.\nCongress will be paying close attention to how courts protect the rights of future victims. Indeed, the CVRA directs the\nAdministrative Office for the U.S. Courts to report each year the number of times that victims have attempted to assert their\nrights and been denied the requested relief. 344 More generally, Congress views the new Act as an important step to protecting\ncrime victims - a \"new and bolder approach, than has ever been tried before in our Federal system.\" 345 Congress is eagerly\nawaiting the results of this approach. As Senator Leahy warned, \"Passage of this bill will necessitate careful oversight of its\nimplementation by Congress.\" 346 Victims' advocates, too, will be watching carefully. 347\nIn light of this thorough and ongoing interest, the judiciary should not merely attempt a \"quick fix\" or minimalist approach to\nimplementing the CVRA, but should comprehensively protect crime victims' rights by changes in court rules. If Congress\nbelieves that the federal rules fail to faithfully reflect crime victims' concerns, it can directly amend the rules. But such direct\namendments may not sufficiently attend to the needs of the judicial branch or others involved in the criminal justice process. It\nis in that spirit of eliminating any need for congressional intervention that this Article [*925] offers proposals to fully and\nfaithfully implement the congressional directive that victims be integrated into the criminal justice process.\nIn the final analysis, whether the courts or Congress redraft the rules is less important than that the redrafting occur. As\ncommanded in the CVRA, crime victims are now participants in federal criminal cases. That new reality must be reflected\nthroughout the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure.\nBrigham Young University Law Review\nCopyright (c) 2005 Brigham Young University Law Review\nEnd of Document\n344\n18 U.S.C.A. 3771, Historical and Statutory Notes (requiring the Administrative Office of the courts to file an annual report with Congress\nconcerning the number of times a victim's right is asserted and denied by federal courts).\n345\n150 Cong.
