  "text": "international community has not significantly changed its relationship with\nthe Palestinians, including Hamas, over the past months and years. There\nhas only been some cosmetic and tactical changes. Washington, the\nEuropean Union and the UN have not only signaled to Hamas that it\nshould join the “broken and paralyzed” peace process, they have also\ninsisted that the Palestinians explicitly recognize Israel. But this time,\nthose powers are armed with an “Islamic religious cloak,” which would\nmake a recognition of Israel more meaningful, especially since Hamas\nconsiders its conflict with Israel to be an ideological “existential conflict,\nnot a border dispute.” That pressure is accompanied with a financial and\neconomic blockade, which is increasing the pressure on Hamas, especially\nsince those carrying out the blockade are blocking anything that would\nalleviate Palestinian suffering. It is clear that they want to punish the\nPalestinians for electing Hamas and warn them against reelecting them;\nthat is if the reconciliation succeeds and the elections happen on time. It\nshould be noted that certain Israeli and Western research institutions have\nestimated the timeframe that Hamas will need to explicitly recognize\nIsrael. They may accept from Hamas certain rhetorical signals for a while\nbefore the movement officially recognizes Israel. Since Hamas was\nfounded in late 1987, it has been conducting an ideological and political\ncampaign for its members and supporters against recognizing Israel.\nHamas’ constitution says that Israel is a “cancer that must be eradicated,”\nand that “its demise is a Quranic inevitability.” Those and other slogans\nhave been a key component of Hamas’s political discourse. It is therefore\nnot easy for Hamas to change overnight due to political realism and\nsuddenly tell its supporters: We shall recognize Israel, but it’s under\nduress!\n\nAdnan Abu Amer is Dean of the Faculty of Arts, and a lecturer in the\nhistory of the Palestinian issue, national security, political science and\nIslamic civilization at Al Ummah University Open Education.\n\nArticle 6.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027114",
