I played a consulting role in\nthe defense of Dr. Spock and eventually wrote an article for the New York Times about the case\nafter the convictions were reversed on appeal.\n\nThe most publicized and notorious of the Vietnam protest cases was the conspiracy prosecution\nagainst the “Chicago 7” growing out of demonstrations during the 1968 Democratic Convention.\nAfter the trial of that case, the lead defense lawyer—William Kunstler—was held in contempt of\ncourt and sentenced to four years imprisonment. I was part of the legal team assembled to\nprepare the appeal of that contempt order. We won.\n\nAnother major prosecution was against the Berrigan brothers and other radical leaders of the draft\nresistance movement. I was asked to work on the defense of that case, but was “fired” by one of\nthe more militant defendants when he learned that I was a Zionist.\n\nThe bitterness of the Vietnam War spread rapidly over college and university campuses. What\nbegan as peaceful teach-ins and protests soon turned to confrontations and violence. In 1969,\nthere was an anti-war protest at Harvard that led to violence and several years of continuous\nturmoil on that venerable campus. These events led the university to attempt to suspend or\ndismiss numerous students. I represented several of these students against the university. One\nwas accused of “giving the finger” to a speaker. Another was accused of shouting “no silence in\nthe face of death,” when the speaker requested a moment of silence for soldiers killed in combat.\nWe won both cases.\n\nAt Stanford University the leader of the antiwar group was a professor of English literature\nnamed Bruce Franklin. He was a Maoist, a Stalinist, and an advocate and practitioner of direct\naction, including violence. As a result of several speeches he gave and activities in which he\nparticipated, the Stanford administration decided to strip him of tenure and fire him. It was the\nfirst political firmg of a tenured professor by a major university since the terrible days of\nMcCarthyism. I took his case on behalf of the American Civil Liberties Union.\n\nAs the war was winding down and the United States was deciding to withdraw from Vietnam, the\nCIA was given a major role in overseeing the American evacuation. One of the highest ranking\nCIA agents in charge of the operation was Frank Snepp. Snepp wrote an uncensored account of\nhis experiences—taking care, however, not to disclose any classified material. He refused to\nsubmit his manuscript for prior “approval” by the CIA, as required in his employment contract.\nWhen his book entitled Decent Interval was published the CIA sued him, and the case eventually\n\n“!
