  "text": "To whom it may concern:\n\n| met Jeffrey Epstein half a dozen years ago. We have been in regular contact since, with many\nlong and often in-depth discussions about a very wide range of topics, including our own\nspecialties and professional work, but a host of others where we have shared interests. It has\nbeen a most valuable experience for me.\n\nIn the area of his own direct engagements, | have learned a great deal from him about the\nintricacies of the global financial system, about complex technical issues that arise in the often\narcane world of finance, and about specific cases in which | have a particular interest, such as\nthe financial situation in Saudi Arabia and current economic planning and prospects there.\nJeffrey invariably turns out to be a highly reliable source, with intimate knowledge and\nperceptive analysis, commonly going well beyond what | can find in the business press and\nprofessional journals.\n\nTurning to my own special interests in linguistics, cognitive science, and philosophy of language\nand mind, Jeffrey constantly raises searching questions and puts forth provocative ideas, which\nhave repeatedly led me to rethink crucial issues.\n\nWe have also had (for me) very rewarding discussions on many other topics, for example the\nprospects for Artificial Intelligence, deep learning, multi-layered neural nets, automation and\nrobotics, singularity, and related matters, exploring the claims and predictions and looking\nclosely at the results that have been achieved, their intellectual contributions and social import.\nWe have also discussed many other issues, ranging from intellectual history, to world affairs and\ncontemporary geopolitics, to foundations of mathematics, to such matters as recent discoveries\nabout communication in the plant world. He has also tried, so far with limited success, to carry\nforward my wife Valeria’s efforts to introduce me to the world of jazz and its wonders.\nWhatever comes up, Jeffrey not only has a lively interest but also unconventional and\nchallenging ideas and thoughtful suggestions.\n\nGiven the range and depth of his concerns, | suppose | should not have been surprised to\ndiscover that Jeffrey has repeatedly been able to arrange, sometimes on the spot, very\nproductive meetings with leading figures in the sciences and mathematics, and global politics,\npeople whose work and activities | had looked into though | had never expected to meet them.\nOnce, when we were discussing the Oslo agreements, Jeffrey picked up the phone and called\nthe Norwegian diplomat who supervised them, leading to a lively interchange. On another\noccasion, Jeffrey arranged a meeting with former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak, whose\nrecord | had studied carefully and written about. We have our disagreements, but had a very\nfruitful discussion about a number of controversial matters, including one that was of particular\ninterest to me: the Taba negotiations of January 2001, in the framework or President Clinton’s\n“parameters,” events that remain obscure and controversial because the diplomatic record is\nstill mostly secret. Barak’s discussion of the background was illuminating, also surprising in\nsome ways. In very different areas, much the same was true in meetings Jeffrey arranged with\nevolutionary biologists, neuroscientists, mathematicians and computer scientists, several of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022405",
