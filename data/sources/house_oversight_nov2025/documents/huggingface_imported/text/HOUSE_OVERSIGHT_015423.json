  "text": "remind somebody else to pass a joint, you lose your own turn.” Since\nBogart and Lauren Bacall were a classic Hollywood couple, | was inspired\nby that snippet of dialogue to say, “Don’ t baca//that joint.”\n\n4. Intuitively, | was an advocate of equal rights and opportunities for\nboth genders long before Women’ s Liberation became a movement. In\n1959, | wrote, “From a completely idealistic viewpoint, classified ads for\njobs should not have separate Male and Female classifications, with\nexceptions such as a _ wet-nurse.” In 1964, that practice became\nillegal. Masturbation was a powerful taboo for females, a subdivision of\nthe war on pleasure, while it was somehow expected of males. But if it was\nokay for guys to jack-off, | wrote in a media fable, 7a/es of Tongue Fu, in\n1974, then it was also okay for girls to jill-off.\n\n5. In 1979, | covered for a weekly alternative paper the trial of ex-cop\nDan White for the double execution of San Francisco Mayor George\nMoscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk, the gay equivalent of Martin Luther\nKing. In a surprise move, homophobic White’ s defense team presented a\nbio-chemical explanation of his behavior, blaming it on compulsive\ngobbling down of sugar-filled junk-food snacks. This was a_ purely\naccidental tactic. Dale Metcalf, an attorney, told me how he happened to\n\nbe playing chess with one of White’ s attorneys, Steven Scherr.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015423",
