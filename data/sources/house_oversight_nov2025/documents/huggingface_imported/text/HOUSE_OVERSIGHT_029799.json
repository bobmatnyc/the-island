  "text": "population” at a time when China and the\nbroad industrialized world is aging.\nAccording to Tharoor, the average age in\nChina today is around 38, whereas in\nIndia it’s around 28. In 20 years, that gap\nwill be much larger. So this could be a\nhuge demographic dividend — “provided\nthat we can educate our youth — offering\nvocational training to some and\nuniversity to others to equip them to take\nadvantage of what the 21st-century global\neconomy offers,” said Tharoor. “If we get\nit right, India becomes the workhorse of\nthe world. If we get it wrong, there is\nnothing worse than unemployable,\nfrustrated” youth.\n\nIndeed, some of India’s disaffected youth\nare turning to Maoism in rural areas. “We\nhave Maoists among our tribal\npopulations, who have not benefited from\nthe opportunities of modern India,”\nTharoor said. There have been violent\nMaoist incidents in 165 of India’s 625\ndistricts in recent years, as Maoists tap\ninto all those left out of the “Indian\ndream.” So there is now a huge push here\nto lure poor kids into school. India runs\nthe world’s biggest midday lunch\nprogram, serving 250 million free school\nlunches each day. It’s also doubled its\nnumber of Indian Institutes of\nTechnology, from eight to 16, and is\nplanning 14 new universities for\ninnovation and research.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029799",
