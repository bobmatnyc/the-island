  "text": "anything but isolated. High school\ngraduates who leave family and friends\nfor the first time to attend college, on the\nother hand, typically experience intense\nfeelings of social isolation even though\nthey are physically around more people\nthan before they left home. Caspi and\ncolleagues (23) found that perceived\nsocial isolation in adolescence and\nyoung adulthood predicted how many\ncardiovascular risk factors (e.g., body\nmass index, waist circumference, blood\npressure, cholesterol) were elevated in\nyoung adulthood, and that the number of\ndevelopmental occasions (i.e.,\nchildhood, adolescence, young\nadulthood) at which participants felt\nsocially isolated predicted the number of\nelevated risk factors in young adulthood.\n\nPerceived social isolation is\nknown more colloquially as loneliness,\nwhich in early scientific investigations\nwas depicted as “a chronic distress\nwithout redeeming features” (24, p. 15).\nLoneliness may feel like a painfully\nmiserable, hopeless, and worthless state,\nbut we have found it has a specific\nstructure and a valuable adaptive\nfunction.\n\nResearch on the ways in which\npeople describe themselves when asked\nthe question, “Who are you?”, reveals\nthree basic dimensions (25): (1) a\npersonal, or intimate, self, the “you” of\nyour individual characteristics; (2) a\nsocial or relational self, which is who\nyou are in relation to the people closest\nto you—your spouse, kids, friends, and\nneighbors; and (3) a collective self, the\nyou that is the member of a certain\nethnic group, has a certain national\nidentity, belongs to certain professional\nor other associations, and a member of\nthe fan club for certain sports teams.\nSimilar to the relational self, this part of\nthe self is social but what makes this self\n\nPage |25\n\ndistinct is that these are broader social\nidentities, linked to larger social groups\nrather than individual members of the\ngroups. When we examined the\ndimensions underlying loneliness/social\nconnectedness, we found the same three\nbasic dimensions (26): (1) intimate\nconnection/isolation refers to the\nperceived presence/absence of anyone in\nyour life who affirms you as a valued\nperson; (2) relational\nconnection/isolation refers to the\nperceived presence/absence of quality\nfriendships or family connections; and\n(3) collective connection/isolation refers\nto the perceived presence/absence of a\nmeaningful connection with a group or\nsocial stimulus (e.g., school, team)\nbeyond other individuals. When you\nperceive you are part of a valued group\n(collective connection), for instance, you\nmay be more inclined to agree with other\ngroup members, even on beliefs that\nmay seem irrational, than when you are\nthinking of yourself as a unique\nindividual.\n\nGiven that human survival and\nprosperity depends on inclusion in and\nparticipation with a social group,\nespecially in evolutionary time when\nfood was scarce and dangers were\ncommon, there is an adaptive benefit to\nhaving the strong and aversive response\nof loneliness when an individual feels\nhis or her social connections might be\nweakening or broken, just as there is a\nbenefit to having aversive signals for\nother conditions critical for survival.\nHunger, thirst, and pain have evolved as\naversive signals to prompt an organism\nto change their behavior in a way that\nprotects the individual and promotes the\nlikelihood their genes will make their\nway into the gene pool. The social pain\nof loneliness has evolved similarly — to\nserve as a signal that one’s connections\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021271",
