I had\nmet Bibi when he was a student in Cambridge in the early 1970’s. We got to know each other\nwhen he served in New York as Israel’s representative to the United Nations. He has been to our\nhome for dinner and we have been at his. Over the years, he has sought my advice on legal and\ngovernmental matters, but not on Israeli domestic politics, which he knows I stay out of.\n\nShortly after he first became Prime Minister, he invited me to his office on a Friday afternoon.\n\nMy wife, our daughter and I stood outside of the King David Hotel trying to hail a cab, but all the\ncab drivers were heading home for the weekend. It looked like we might be late for our\nappointment with the Prime Minister. Suddenly a car pulled up. It was the mayor of Jerusalem,\nEhud Olmert, whom I knew. He rolled down his window and shouted, “Alan, you’ll never get a\ncab on a Friday afternoon. Where do you need to go?” I told him and he willingly agreed to\ndrive us there. As I began to get into his car, a cab driver pulled over and said, “I'll take them.”\nOlmert replied, “No, no, it’Il be my pleasure.” The cab driver pulled his car in front of Olmert’s,\nblocking it and shouting, “I don’t try to run Jerusalem, why are you trying to be a cab driver?\nStop taking business from me.” Only in Jerusalem! I paid the cab driver what his fare would’ve\nbeen and took the ride with the mayor.\n\nWhen I got to the Prime Minister’s office, Bibi spent a few minutes with us and then invited me to\nhis private office for a confidential meeting. He explained that this was one of the most secure\nlocations in the world and that anything I told him would never leave the room. He then said,\n“There’s been something I have been waiting to ask you.” I expected him to ask my advice on\nsome critical security or political issue, as he had in the past. I said, “Sure, ask me anything.” He\nput his arm around me and whispered in my ear, “So, did O.J. do it?” I was taken aback but I\nquickly responded, “So, Mr. Prime Minister, does Israel have nuclear weapons?” Bibi looked at\nme sternly and said, “You know I can’t answer that question.” I looked back at him and said,\n“Aha!” Bibi understood and we both laughed.\n\nOver the years I have advised Netanyahu on a variety of issues during his tenure as Prime Minister\nand between his terms. I do not share all of his political and diplomatic views, and he knows that,\nbut he seems to value my judgment, as do several other Israeli political leaders to the left of him.\nThey know I care deeply about Israel and will always give them my unbiased views.\n\nRecently, Netanyahu made the following statement during a nationally-televised conference in\nIsrael:\n\n“First off, I would like to congratulate the Globes Conference for its foresight in inviting\nAlan Dershowitz and I would like to say to Alan. Israel has no greater champion and the\ntruth has no greater defender than Alan Dershowitz.”\n\nI was obviously flattered by his comment. Several hours later, I received a call from President\n\nObama, who had apparently learned of Netanyahu’s words. He said he valued my views because\n“you've always been straight with me over the years that we’ve known each other.” He asked me\n\n364\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017451",
