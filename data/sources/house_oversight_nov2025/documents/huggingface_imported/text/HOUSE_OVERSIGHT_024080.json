  "text": "in the public equity markets could result in substantially lower liquidation values and\nsubstantially longer periods before liquidity is achieved in comparison with historical values,\nwhich would reduce the returns that could be achieved by the Fund. In addition, factors\nspecific to a portfolio company may have an adverse effect on the Fund’s investment in such\ncompany. The General Partner may rely upon its own or a portfolio company’s projections\nconcerning the portfolio company’s future performance in making investment decisions. Such\nprojections are inherently subject to uncertainty and to certain factors beyond the control of the\nportfolio company and the General Partner. Prospective investors are particularly cautioned\nthat the investment sourcing, selection, management and liquidation strategies and procedures\nexercised by partners of the General Partner in the past may not be successful, or even\npracticable, during the Fund’s term.\n\nIndustry Specific Terminology\n\nProspective investors are cautioned that certain terms and phrases of common usage within the\nventure capital industry may be misleading to those unfamiliar with such usage. In particular,\nindividuals who participate in the management of a fund often are referred to, in a colloquial\nsense, as “general partners” even though they are not actually general partners of any\npartnership. Prospective investors are reminded that the Fund will be a limited partnership,\nthat the General Partner will be a limited partnership, that the general partner of the General\nPartner will be a limited liability company, and that the individuals directing the management\nof the Fund through the General Partner will be members of such limited liability company. It\nis not intended that the Fund will have any general partner other than the General Partner or\nthat any actual general partnership will in any manner be associated with the formation,\noperation, dissolution or termination of the Fund. Prospective investors must not presume or\nrely upon the existence of any actual legal entities other than the Fund, the General Partner and\nthe general partner of the General Partner. With respect to all matters involving industry\nspecific terminology, prospective investors are urged to consult with their own legal and other\nadvisors.\n\nFund and General Partner Not Registered\n\nThe Fund will not be registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the\n“Investment Company Act”) pursuant to an exemption set forth in Sections 3(c)(1) and/or\n3(c)(7) of the Investment Company Act. There is no assurance that such exemptions will\ncontinue to be available to the Fund. Due to the burdens of compliance with the Investment\nCompany Act, the performance of the Fund’s investment portfolio could be materially\nadversely affected, and risks involved in financing portfolio companies could substantially\nincrease, if the Fund becomes subject to registration under the Investment Company Act.\nNeither the Fund nor its counsel can assure investors that, under certain conditions, changed\ncircumstances, or changes in the law, the Fund may not become subject to the Investment\nCompany Act or other burdensome regulation. The General Partner is not registered as a\nbroker/dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”) and\nwith the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the “NASD”) and is consequently not\nsubject to the record keeping and specific business practice provisions of the Exchange Act and\nthe rules of the NASD.\n\n69 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024080",
