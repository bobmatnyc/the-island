Meanwhile, non-dealer positions\nin US index futures stand well below the levels\n\nseen in 2013-14, providing scope for upside (see\nExhibit 57). If bull markets “die on euphoria” as\nSir John Templeton observed, then these measures\nargue we have not yet reached the apex.\n\nA rare technical analysis signal corroborates\nthat view. As shown in Exhibit 58, the Coppock\ncurve—an intermediate-length momentum signal—\nhas generated only 17 buy signals over the past 71\nyears, but collectively they have provided attractive\nlow-risk entry points for long-term investors. If\nwe took the median path of S&P 500 prices after\npast signals, it would imply the market gains 9%\nthis year with 88% odds of a positive outcome. Of\nparticular note, Coppock buy signals on the NYSE,\nRussell 2000 and FTSE All-World Index were also\ntriggered in November, even before the post-election\nrally. For all the reasons discussed above, we accord\na 25% probability to our good-case scenario of the\nS&P 500 reaching 2,450 by year-end.\n\nOf course, we are equally aware of the myriad\ndownside risks investors face, including growing\nunease about a disorderly backup in bond yields.\nBut here, our work suggests that rates have scope\nto increase further before becoming a headwind for\nstocks, even if adjusted for today’s lower long-run\nequilibrium nominal rate (see Exhibit 59}. Keep\nin mind that 88% of S&P 500 debt has a fixed\ninterest rate and only about 10% matures each\nyear. The impact of higher rates will be spread over\nmany years as a consequence.\n\n54 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014587",
