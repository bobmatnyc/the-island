  "text": "finance like the futures exchange or immunological networks or our own brains,\nhighly-connected systems shared what Holland labeled an “evolving structure” -\nthey never stayed the same. They seemed to shift, with an easy plasticity, in\nresponse to internal pressures or external changes. In the process, they took on new\nforms. In many cases, they became better, stronger, more adaptively fit. It wasn’t\nsimply that the unexpected appeared, it was that the systems were evolving. We\ntalked earlier about how political and economic ideas like serfdom or divine right\nfade into history as new forms - a congress, a stock market - are born to replace old\nones. Holland thought the world filled with such evolutions, no different than\nspecies adjusting (or not) to a hotter climate or some fast new predator. He called\nthe networks that produce these sorts of innovations “Complex Adaptive Systems”.\n\nWhen Holland chose the word “complex” he was making an important distinction.\nComplicated mechanisms can be designed, predicted and controlled. Jet engines,\nartificial hearts or your calculator are complicated in this sense. They may contain\nbillions of interacting parts, but they can be laid out and repeatedly, predictably\nmade and used. They don’t change. Complex systems, by contrast, can’t be so\nprecisely engineered or guessed at with much real certainty. They are hard to fully\ncontrol. Human immunology is complex, in this sense. The World Wide Web is\ncomplex. A rainforest is complex: It is made up of uncountable buzzing, connecting\nbugs and birds and trees.1!4 Order, to the extent it exists in the Amazon basin,\nemerges moment-by-moment from countless, constant interactions. The uneven\nsymphonic sound of L’heure Blue, that romantic stopping point at dawn when the\nnight retreats bug by bug and you can hear the forest wakeing bird by bird is the\nsound of complexity engaging in a never-the-same-twice phase transition.\n\nThe word “complex” comes to us from the Latin world plex, which nods at the\ninterwoven, layered nature of any object!!3. What looks simple - a flower, our skin,\nthe value of a dollar bill - is in fact plexus, loaded with twitches and influences. In\nthat stitching of new links, countless interactions sort of inevitably hiccup into\nunexpected states and ideas and objects: financial panics or disease epidemics,\nbanks and revolutions. Traffic during rush hour is a complex system like this - the\natomic, moving bits of the system, of cars and pedestrians and bicycles together\ndetermine the ultimate state of the system: jammed or no. Los Angles at 5 p.m. ona\nFriday isn’t designed centrally; it’s honking and confused and aggravated rush hour\nlogic appears - slightly different every day - from interaction. . As any system fills\nout with more actors and more types of connection, it becomes more complex and\nharder to predict. Complicated systems don’t produce uncertainty in this same way;\nappealingly, they just run. Strapping a complicated object to the wing of a passenger\nplane makes sense, even if it takes decades of refinement to real reliability. A\ncomplex object? Not so wise.\n\n112 A rainforest: Simon A.
