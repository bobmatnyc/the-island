  "text": "We do not believe this tightening cycle will lead to a US recession in 2017.\n\ncould derail the last innings of this recovery and\nbull market. The first three are low-probability\nrisks in our view, the next three risks have a\n\nhigh probability of occurring but their impact is\nuncertain and the last two are high-probability and\nhigh-impact risks beginning as early as 2017.\n\nLow-Probability but High-Impact Risks:\n\n¢ The pace of Federal Reserve tightening\nis disruptive and financial markets\nreact negatively.\nThe economy slips into recession.\nPopulist parties in the Eurozone\ngain greater influence.\n\nHigh-Probability but Uncertain-Impact Risks:\n¢ Geopolitical hot spots get hotter.\n¢ Terrorism escalates.\n¢ Cyberattacks continue.\n\nHigh-Probability and High-Impact Risks:\n¢ China submerges under its debt burden and\ncapital outflows.\n* US-China relations deteriorate under the Trump\nadministration.\n\nPace of Federal Reserve Tightening\n\nUnlike the December 2015 interest rate hike that\nprompted a vocal response from naysayers but had\nlimited impact on the bond market, the December\n2016 hike has elicited a muted response from\nmarket commentators but has had a larger impact\non the bond market. The underlying strength of the\nlabor market and the steady improvement in the\neconomy have led to a change of sentiment toward\nmore interest rate hikes, which are clearly in the\n\noffing. Interest rates have increased from\na low of 1.3% for the 10-year Treasury\nin July 2016 to 2.4% by year-end. While\nthis increase in interest rates would\nordinarily tighten financial conditions,\n\nit has been partially offset by stronger\nequity markets and tighter corporate\nbond spreads. In fact, financial conditions\nwere looser at the end of the year than\nthey were at the beginning of 2016\ndespite expectations of a slow but steady\nincrease in the federal funds rate.\n\nWe share the market view that the\npace of monetary policy tightening will\naccelerate but remain benign. As shown\nin Exhibit 23, the difference between\nthe Federal Reserve dots, the view implied by the\nbond market, the forecast by our colleagues in\nGIR and our view is negligible. The bond market\nhas priced two hikes, the Federal Reserve and GIR\nexpect three hikes, and we think two or three hikes\nare equally likely in 2017. We assume that the\nFederal Reserve will slow down the pace of interest\n\nThere is no shortage of concerns as markets climb a wall of worry.\n\n26 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014559",
