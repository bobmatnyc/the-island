  "text": "communities enfolded the care of the\nsick into a communal life of liturgy and\nprayer. This is not to say that the\nsubstantively irreligious lack proper\nmotivation to practice medicine. It is to\nsay that an animating vision for\nmedicine as a good and worthy activity\nseems to require moral concepts that\nscience alone does not provide.\n\nHow should medical science be\ndeployed?\n\nMedicine is not only animated by\nsomething like a religious vision; it also\nrequires a thick moral framework for its\nongoing direction. To know how best to\ncare for patients, we need to know\nsomething about what human flourishing\nentails and how medicine can contribute\nto it. Medical science is less helpful here\nthan one might hope.\n\nScience facilitates the sort of\nreligious humanism that Browning\nencourages, because it helps us better\nunderstand the empirical world and\ntherefore helps all moral communities\nrefine their efforts to bring about human\nflourishing. Science elucidates a range of\ntechnical possibilities and provides\ninformation about what we can\nreasonably expect as the consequence of\nchoosing one course over another. Yet,\neven the successes of medical science\nhighlight its limits. As medical science\ngenerates technologies that can be put to\never-wider uses, it exposes\ndisagreements about which of those uses\nare worthwhile. Although medicine\nproceeds in scientific ways in the care of\npatients, it does so in pursuit of goals\nthat science cannot set. These goals\ncome from moral traditions and cultures,\nreligious or otherwise.\n\nIn the same way that the\ninfluence of a dominant culture on\nmedical practice is often invisible or\n\n142\n\nPage\n\ntaken for granted precisely because of its\ndominance, so the influence of religious\nideas on medical practice is often\ninvisible in those areas where\ncommitments are shared in common\namong different religions and other\nmoral traditions. For example, we\ngenerally take it for granted that\nmending injuries, treating infections, and\nremoving diseased organs are good\nthings to do. That is because the moral\ncommitments that undergird these\npractices are shared by virtually all\nmoral communities, religious or\notherwise. Moral commitments that are\nshared by all may not seem ‘moral’ at\nall. Yet even the idea of sickness implies\na norm of and concern for health that are\nnot fully derivable from empirical\nscience.\n\nThe influence of religion on\nmedical practice becomes more visible\nwhere the commitments of particular\ntraditions diverge from one another or\nwhere they diverge from the values of\nthe dominant culture. For example,\nreligious measures have been found\nconsistently to strongly predict\nphysicians’ attitudes regarding ethically\ncontroversial practices such as abortion,\nphysician-assisted suicide, withdrawal of\nlife-sustaining therapies, contraception,\nphysician interaction with patients about\nspiritual concerns and, as we have found,\nphysicians’ ideas about the relationship\nbetween religion and health.’\n\nYet overtly controversial issues\nmerely highlight the tips of proverbial\nicebergs. Disputes about practices such\nas abortion or physician-assisted suicide\nconcern whether the practices are\nintrinsically unethical. Much more\ncommonly physicians agree about the\nrange of legitimate clinical strategies,\nbut they disagree about which is to be\nrecommended in a given moment. For\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021388",
