  "text": "2017 OUTLOOK\n\nIn Closing\n\nWE DO NOT BELIEVE THE COMING YEAR WILL BRING AN END\nto the prolonged run of positive performance for either the\nUS economy or the bull market for equities. Despite greater\nuncertainties, including those tied to a new US administration,\nthe policy backdrop in the US will likely prove particularly\nfavorable for the economy, with looser fiscal policy, still easy\nmonetary policy and a lighter regulatory burden. As these\nfactors diminish the probability of recession in 2017, they\nalso support the case for clients remaining invested in global\nequities at their strategic allocation. We believe US equity\ngains are likely to be modest but still more attractive than the\ncomparable returns of investment alternatives such as cash\nand bonds. And, as last year demonstrated, US equities often\nsurprise to the upside.\n\nWhile we see the glass as half-full, there is no shortage of\nrisks—some of which have high probability and uncertain\nimpact for the year ahead—that could cause our forecasts for\nthe economy and asset class returns to miss the mark.\n\nAs always, we will adjust and communicate our views\naccordingly should the economic, financial or geopolitical\nbackdrop change materially over the course of 2017.\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 79\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014612",
