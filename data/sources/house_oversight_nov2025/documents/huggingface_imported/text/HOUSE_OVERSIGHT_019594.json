In mid-June, while Harrison was laying down false\ntracks for Snowden in Hong Kong, Assange in London asked Fidel\nNarvaez, who was a friend of his and the legal attaché in the Lon-\ndon embassy of Ecuador, to issue a document that Snowden could\nuse. But this document was not delivered to Snowden in Hong Kong\n(and it was later invalidated by Ecuador). There are no direct flights\nto Ecuador from Hong Kong. If Snowden had really planned to go to\nEcuador without stopping in a country allied with the United States,\nhe would have had to fly to Cuba. He would need a Cuban travel\ndocument to do that, which he could have obtained from the Cuban\nconsulate anytime during his month in Hong Kong. But he did not\nobtain it. Nor did he acquire a visa to go to any other country in\nLatin America or elsewhere while in Hong Kong. So where was he\nheaded?\n\n© Whatever foreign government with which Snowden was deal- ©\ning earlier presumably did not have an extradition treaty with the\nUnited States. Almost all other countries that did not have active\nextradition treaties with the United States could not be directly\nreached by air. With three notable exceptions, the flights to most of\nthese countries had stopovers in a country that was an ally of the\nUnited States, where officials could seize Snowden. The three excep-\ntions were China, North Korea (via China), and Russia.\n\nThe only one of these three countries that Snowden is known\nto have had contact with directly during his thirty-three-day stay\nin Hong Kong was Russia. The Russian president, Vladimir Putin,\nrevealed these contacts in a televised press briefing in September\n2013. Putin did not provide the date of these contacts, but he pro-\nvided an intriguing clue. Snowden was identified to him, according\nto Putin, not by name but merely as an “agent of special services.”\nIf his name was not given to Putin, it might have been because\nSnowden’s first meeting with the Russians had taken place before\nSnowden became a household name on June 9, 2013.\n\nFor his part, Snowden was evasive when discussing his con-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 106 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019594",
