  "text": "Seth Meyers Proves Trump Is the Real ‘Husband From Hell’\n\n“It’s such an ‘80s comedienne premise, but then it was also my truth so I was trying to reconcile with\nit. It’s hard to not be meta about it, because just to say ‘I’m single’ on stage. There’s something that\nfeels so inherently hacky about it that I feel like I have these guilt pangs and then it just becomes a\nwhole other bit. It’s always weird to navigate. I’ve always been in relationships for big chunks of time\n\nand every time I come out I’m like a generation older and I don’t know what my station is.”\n\nNext week on Zhe Last Laugh podcast: Arrested Development and Veep star Tony Hale.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031784",
