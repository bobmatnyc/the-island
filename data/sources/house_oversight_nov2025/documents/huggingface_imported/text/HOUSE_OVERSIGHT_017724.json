  "text": "Page 10 of 52\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *851\n\n(4) The right to be reasonably heard at any public proceeding in the district court involving release, plea, sentencing, or any\nparole proceeding;\n\n(5) The reasonable right to confer with the attorney for the Government in the case;\n\n(6) The right to full and timely restitution as provided in law;\n\n(7) The right to proceedings free from unreasonable delay;\n\n(8) The right to be treated with fairness and with respect for the victim's dignity and privacy. 8?\n\nRather than relying merely on the \"best efforts\" of prosecutors to vindicate rights, the CVRA also contains specific\nenforcement [*852] mechanisms. ?° Most importantly, it directly gives victims standing to assert their rights, addressing a\nflaw in the earlier enactment. ?! The Act provides that rights can be \"asserted\" by \"the crime victim, the crime victim's lawful\nrepresentative, and the attorney for the Government.\" °* The victim or the government may appeal any denial of a victim's\nright through a writ of mandamus on an expedited basis. °? The courts are also required to \"ensure that the crime victim is\nafforded the rights\" in the new law. °4\n\nThese changes were intended to make the victim \"an independent participant in the proceedings.\" °° Congress desired to\nmodify what it viewed as the unfair treatment of crime victims; in particular, congressional sponsors of the CVRA cited the\nOklahoma City bombing case as the kind of decision that they intended the new law to overrule.\n\nII. The Need To Place Victims' Rights in the Rules\n\nWith the CVRA in place as the law of the land, the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure should be amended to conform to the\n\nstatute. While one court has derisively referred to the Act as mere \"mushy, feel good legislation,\" °7 it in fact substantively\n\nchanges the posture of crime victims on a whole host of issues. In the wake of the Act, victims now must be folded into the\nprocess through which federal courts conduct criminal cases, including bail, plea, trial, and sentencing hearings. The Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure - the \"playbook\" of the federal courts - should reflect this fact.\n\nSome might agree that victims now have a number of new rights, but nonetheless dispute the need for a rules amendment.\nAfter all, 1t might be argued, the CVRA in fact creates substantive rights for crime victims. Because nothing in the federal\nprocedural [*853] rules can modify substantive rights, °° the CVRA will trump any conflicting provision in the federal rules.\n°° Tn other words, the CVRA will automatically govern federal criminal proceedings even if the rules remain as written.\n\n8 18 US.C.A. 3771 (a) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n\n°° Td. 3771(d).\n\n°!
