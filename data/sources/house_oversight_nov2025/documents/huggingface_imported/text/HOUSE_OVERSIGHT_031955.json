  "text": "Article 5.\n\nForeign Policy\n\nBarack Obama's Foreign Policy\n\nNovember 16, 2011\n\nForeign-policy credentials: As president, Obama has taken on a\nnumber of major foreign-policy initiatives, including a renewed troop\nsurge in Afghanistan, the negotiation of the New START nuclear\narms reduction treaty with Russia, the NATO intervention in Libya,\nthe withdrawal from Iraq, ongoing trade negotiations with China, and\nof course, the killing of al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden.\n\nOverview: Obama is a much different candidate today from the\nsenator who distinguished himself by his opposition to the \"dumb\nwar\" on his way to the presidency in 2008. Obama has turned out, in\nmany ways, to have pursued a fairly conventional, at times, hawkish\nforeign policy. He has had some notable successes, such as the bin\nLaden raid and this year's withdrawal from Iraq -- albeit on a\ntimetable negotiated by his predecessor -- and the successful\noverthrow of Muammar al-Qaddafi. All the same, \"apology tours\"\nand \"leading from behind\" -- referring to an unfortunate description\nof Obama's diplomatic strategy by a White House staffer -- have\nalready become buzzwords for Republican candidates. He has also\nfaced heavy criticism on the left for a sometimes inconsistent\napproach to international law in counterterrorism operations.\n\nBut with a significant economic recovery appearing unlikely and\nfewer domestic achievements to point to than he might have\nexpected, coupled with the international inexperience of his\nopponents, Obama may make his foreign-policy wins the centerpiece\nof his reelection strategy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031955",
