  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nWe were unaware of the pervasive poverty and deprivations — educational, economic, medical,\nnutritional — that would make real equality impossible, at least in the near term, for so many black\npeople, even if legal inequalities were eliminated.\n\nI should have known better even back then, especially after I twice travelled to the Deep South\noccasions during the turbulent years of the civil rights movement. My first trip was in the early\n1960s as part of a student group that was trained at the Howard Law School to be “observers.”\nDuring that short visit I had little direct contact with local Black residents of the South. I did\nmeet several Black lawyers and civil rights workers, but they were generally from similar\nbackgrounds to my own. My second trip was by myself in the early summer of 1965, when the\nHarvard Law School sent me to several historically black colleges in an effort to recruit students\nfor a special program we had instituted to help prepare minority students for law school. I\ntraveled to several Southern states and lived on the campuses of predominantly Black colleges for\nseveral days. There too I met college students and professors, many of whom came from middle\nclass homes. I almost certainly met some students from deprived backgrounds, but they\nappeared, in the context of a campus setting, no different from students with middle class\nupbringings.\n\nI also spent time at several southwestern colleges with Native American and Hispanic students. I\nhad insisted that our recruitment efforts not be limited to African American students and that they\nshould include other minorities and disadvantaged groups that sent few if any students to elite law\nschools. Even back then, I felt uncomfortable having any decisions, even affirmative ones, based\non race alone. I believed then, and I believe now, that the ideal goal of affirmative action is to\nlevel the playing field by providing a current advantage to individuals who were subject to past\ndisadvantages, in order to assure future equal opportunities to compete on the merits with\nadvantaged individuals. That is the theoretical ideal — individual justice to assure that each person\nis judged by the quality of their character and other meritocratic criteria — but I soon learned that\nin practice group factors inevitably come into play. The real issue is how to strike the appropriate\nbalance between the theoretical ideal and the practical necessities.\n\nThis issue came to the fore in a series of controversial Supreme Court decisions, in which I played\ndifferent roles. The first was the case of DeFunis in 1974.*’ The second was the case of Bakke in\n1997,\n\nThe DeFunis case was brought by a white applicant to the law school of the University of\nWashington, a state school, who had been rejected. He claimed that if he had been Black, he\nwould have been admitted under the school’s affirmative action program. The school did not\ndispute this claim, but argued that it had the right to try to achieve “a reasonably representation”\nof minority students.\n\nThe lower court ruled in favor of Marco DeFunis and ordered his admission. By the time the case\nreached the Supreme Court, he had nearly graduated and the school told the justices that he\nwould be allowed to graduate even if the Supreme Court ruled against him. For that reason, the\nHigh Court dismissed the case as moot, thus postponing the decision as to whether it would\nuphold race-specific affirmative action programs. But Justice William O. Douglas, probably the\n\n57 DeFunis v. Odegaard, 416 U.S. 312 (1974).\n\n291\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017378",
