  "text": "costs me more than just the price I paid for the product, both in time and actual postage. Risk elimination\njust isn’t enough.\n\nThis is where we enter the neglected realm of lose-win guarantees and risk reversal. The NR use what\nmost consider an afterthought—the guarantee—as a cornerstone sales tool.\n\nThe NR aim to make it profitable for the customer even if the product fails. Lose-win guarantees not\nonly remove risk for the consumer but put the company at financial risk.\n\nHere are a few examples of putting your money where your mouth is.\n\nDelivered in 30 minutes or less or it’s free!\n(Domino’s Pizza built its business on this guarantee.)\n\nWe’re so confident you'll like CIALIS, if you don’t we’ll pay for the brand of your choice.\n(The “CIALIS® Promise Program” offers a free sample of CIALIS and then offers to pay for\ncompeting products if CIALIS doesn’t live up to the hype.)\n\nIf your car is stolen, we’ll pay $500 of your insurance deductible.\n(This guarantee helped THE CLUB become the #1-selling mechanical automobile anti-theft device in\nthe world.)\n\n110% guaranteed to work within 60 minutes of the first dose.\n\n(This was for BodyQUICK and a first among sports nutrition products. I offered to not only refund\ncustomers the price of the product if it didn’t work within 60 minutes of the first dose, but also to send\nthem a check for 10% more.)\n\nThe lose-win guarantee might seem like a big risk, especially when someone can abuse it for profit like\nin the BodyQUICK example, but it isn’t ... if your product delivers. Most people are honest.\n\nLet’s look at some actual numbers.\n\nReturns for BodyQUICK, even with a 60-day return period (and partially because of it), are less\nthan 3% in an industry in which the average is 12-15% for a normal 30-day 100% money-back\nguarantee. Sales increased more than 300% within four weeks of introducing the 110% guarantee, and\nreturns decreased overall.\n\nJohanna adopted this lose-win offer and came up with “Increase sport-specific flexibility 40% in two\nweeks or return it for a full refund (including shipping) and keep the 20-minute bonus DVD as our gift.”\n\nSherwood found his guarantee as well: “If these shirts are not the most comfortable you’ ve ever worn,\nreturn them and get 2-times your purchase price back. Each shirt is also guaranteed for life—if it gets\nthreadbare, send it back and we’ll replace it free of charge.”\n\nBoth of them increased sales more than 200% in the first two months. Return percentage remained the\nsame for Johanna and increased 50% for Sherwood, from 2 to 3%. Disaster? Far from it. Instead of\nselling 50 and getting one back with a 100% guarantee [(50 x $100) — $100 = $4,900 in revenue], he sold\n200 and got six back with the 200% guarantee [(200 x $100) — (6 x $200) = $18,800 in revenue]. I'll take\nthe latter.\n\nLose-win is the new win-win. Stand out and reap the rewards.\n\nLittle Blue Chip: How to Look Fortune 500 in 45 Minutes\n\nAre you tired of sand being kicked in your face? I promise you new muscles in days!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013930",
