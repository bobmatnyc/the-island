I work at Stanford in an interdisciplinary institute, and\nI’ve been associated with these kinds of outfits for most of my years.\nAnd those are where the most interesting research gets done.\n\nSHAFFER: What field outside of political science has the most\nimportant insights for understanding political order?\n\nFUKUYAMA: That’s hard to say. I don’t know if there is one. Part\nof the problem is economics — it’s a very important discipline, but in\na way it’s colonized the rest of the social sciences. A lot of political\nanalysis in academia is driven by this model of everybody being a\nrational decision maker driven by more or less material interests.\nThere’s obviously something to that, but it’s a very limited way of\nlooking about politics, which is about dignity and values and ideas\nthat can’t be explained in material terms. Other disciplines —\nsociology and anthropology — have gotten at those things better than\neconomics has.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031900",
