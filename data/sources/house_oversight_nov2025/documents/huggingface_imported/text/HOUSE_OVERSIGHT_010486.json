She'd interviewed \nseveral of Epstein's friends and ex-friends: Nobel Prize—winning \nscientists, financiers who worked with Epstein at Bear Stearns. \nShe'd handled Steven Hoffenberg with aplomb. And, working \nwith Vanity Fair's editors, she'd figured out ways to slip even more \ninformation between the lines, in ways that would allow readers \nto form their own questions about Epstein's finances. \nIn that respect, she'd fulfilled her original assignment perfectly. \nWhat Carter needed to figure out was what to do with the \nartist, her sister, and their mother's story. But before he could \nswipe his key card to let himself into the magazine's offices, Car-\nter saw a man standing in the reception area. \nThe man was motionless. He'd been waiting for Carter. \nIt was Jeffrey Epstein. Nonplussed, Carter invited him into \nhis office. \nEpstein denied the claims involving underage women. No crimi-\nnal charges had been filed. And so Vanity Fair decided not to \ninclude the claims in Ward's article. But, according to Ward, \nwhen her editor Doug Stumpf called her, she cried. \nShe'd worked so hard on the piece, gotten so stressed out that \none of her twins had begun to grow more slowly than the other. \nOn doctor's orders; she'd been put on bed rest. \n151 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \n\"Why?\" she asked when she got to speak to Carter directly. \n\"He's sensitive about the young women. And we still get to \nrun most of the piece.\" \nIn her notebook, Ward wrote down the rest of what Carter \nhad said: \"I believe him,\" he told her. \"I'm Canadian.\" \nBut the piece that came out, in the March issue, still created a \nsensation. It was called \"The Talented Mr. Epstein\" in a sly refer-\nence to Patricia Highsmith's celebrated suspense novel The Tal-\nented Mr. Ripley. The film adaptation, by Anthony Minghella, was \nstill fresh in the minds of Vanity Fair's readers. For Graydon \nCarter, just posing the question Is Epstein some sort of scam artist, \nlike Ripley? had been question enough. And throughout the \npiece, there were ironies readers wouldn't miss as they drew \ntheir own conclusions about Epstein's life story. It came through \nclearly in the first line of the last paragraph of Ward's 7,500-word \nstory: \"Many people comment there is something innocent, \nalmost childlike about Jeffrey Epstein.\" \nIn context, the word innocent was rather ironic—so much so \nthat it almost became its own opposite. \n752 \nTodd Meister: June 20_ \nHarry Cipriani, on \ntion.

The restaurant began its life as an American out-\npost of Harry's Bar—which was itself a famous American \noutpost in Venice. Located inside the Sherry-Netherland hotel, \nit's a theme restaurant—the theme being money. And today, a \nhedge-fund manager named Todd Meister is talking about a very \nwealthy man—Jeffrey Epstein—whom he knows through his \nfather, Epstein's sometime friend Bob Meister. \n\"I've known Jeffrey since I was nineteen,\" Meister says. \"So \nlet me tell you what I know—whatever everyone knows and \neverybody else says. First Off, he's no billionaire. Second off—\nand here's why—he has no clue how to invest. He has people do \nthat for him.\" \nMeister knows how to invest. He does it for other people and, as \nthe son of a superrich father, for himself. He also knows about the \n153 \n\f71-\nJAMES PATTERSON \ngood life. Parties in Vegas; weekends in the Hamptons; affairs with \nbeautiful women that end up getting splashed all over the tabloids. \nIt makes sense that, once upon a time, he and Epstein would \nhave gotten along. \n\"As for the girls,\" Meister says, \"that was just business. He'd \nseat them strategically at client dinners. When he went to the \nmovies, he'd take three or four girls with him. They'd take turns \nmassaging his back, arms, and legs.\" \nAccording to Meister, Epstein used to boast that he \"liked to \ngo into insane asylums because he liked to fuck crazy women.\" \n\"Who knows if it's true?\" Meister adds. \"But I'm telling you, \nhe used to say it.\" \nFrom time to time, Epstein's friends and acquaintances would \nsee sides of Epstein that he'd grown much less shy about sharing. \nEpstein encouraged Alan Dershowitz to invest with a prominent \nhedge-fund manager named Orin Kramer. Dershowitz did, and he \nmade a lot of money at first. But in 2008, the fund Dershowitz had \ninvested in lost a substantial amount. Afterward, according to a for-\nmer associate of Epstein's, Epstein appeared in Kramer's midtown \nManhattan office. There, sources say, he told Kramer: \"It's very much \nin your interest to make Alan Dershowitz whole.\" \nEpstein's intervention worked, and Dershowitz recovered his \nmoney. \nTo people who'd known Epstein back in the 1980s, this kind of \nbehavior was out of character. But the thing about Epstein was \nthat you never could figure him out. One minute he was charming. \n154 \nFILT \nThe most charming man you'd \nthreat, and bluster.

Then \nyou plug in the parties. The scene brings Eyes Wide Shut to mind. \nBut the thing is, Eyes Wide Shut only works in the shadows. For \nEpstein, getting on that plane with Clinton was more like a \nmoment in Caddyshack — the one in which the groundhog peeks \nout from his hole in the golf course. From there on in, Jeffrey \nEpstein was like the mole in a game of whack-a-mole. It was only \na matter of time before he'd be caught. But the question you had \nto ask yourself was, are people like Epstein born without mor-\nals? Or are their morals like snakeskin—just something they \nshed (along with all the other basic, day-to-day concerns that \neveryday working people have) as they make their way into that \nEyes Wide Shut world? \nTodd Meister, who was married to Nicky Hilton and stole the \nheiress Samantha Boardman away from Conde Nast's former \neditorial director James Truman, should know. He wonders out \nloud: \n\"How does a yutz like Epstein get beautiful women?\" \nAt Harry Cipriani, the question lingers in the air. \n155 \n\fPART IV \nThe Investigation \n\fCHAPTER 40 \nMichael Reiter: January 2006 \n1 \nAs far as Michael Reiter's concerned, the case that his team \nhas built against Epstein—slowly, meticulously, over the \ncourse of an entire year—is airtight. Even now, Detective \nRecarey's finding new pieces of evidence. And already Reiter's \nbeen laying the groundwork with prosecutors. State attorney \nBarry Krischer has a reputation for toughness. He's known, \nnationally, for his prosecution of juvenile offenders. And Reiter's \nbeen keeping him abreast of the investigation. With Jeffrey \nEpstein, it's not simply a matter of seeing him punished. It's a \nmatter of getting a sexual predator off the streets of Palm Beach. \nKrischer assures the chief that he's taking this case very \nseriously. \nThe state attorney's office will have Reiter's back at every \nturn. \n\"I told him that we had an investigation that was very serious \n159 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nDetective Recarey: Feb, \nIFor months, Joe Reca \nbeen brought to Epsi \nand car-rental records \naccording to a source withi; \nwould identify forty-seven \non El Brillo Way. \nRecarey interviewed or \nDavid Rogers, as well as Ep5. \nHe also spoke to a woman v \nIt turned out that Epste \nactual Swedish deep-tissue] \nfor him and his friends, ti \nthem. \nDid anything untoward \nEpstein ever asked the worn; \nthat involved a very noteworthy person and that involved a num-\nber of underage females,\" Reiter would say in his deposition for \nthe suit that was later settled by Epstein. \"That it was of a sexual \nnature. I was concerned that we had not reached all of the vic-\ntims, and we hadn't, I'm sure, at this point. I told him that I felt \nlike the suspect would probably become aware of the investiga-\ntion at some point and that we should probably expect some con-\ntact from.. . Mr. Epstein's lawyers. And I told him that I wanted \nto keep him very well informed on this and that I hoped that he \nwould do the same. And that we would have to have more con-\ntact in making sure it was handled responsibly, intelligently, and \nappropriately as it moved forward.\" \nReiter would say that Epstein's name did not seem to ring a \nbell with the state attorney. But shortly afterward, the chief \nbecame aware that in certain powerful circles his investigation \nwas being looked upon unfavorably. \"I had many people-related \nconversations ... on the cocktail-party circuit that suggested we \napproach this in a way that wasn't necessary,\" he would say. \nMichael Reiter was a good cop. A good man. But he was about \nto discover that when it came to men with the power and influ-\nence Epstein wielded, fairness under the law was a relative, mal-\nleable concept. \n160 \n\fA.TTERSON \n• person and that involved a num-\nr would say in his deposition for \np7 Epstein. \"That it was of a sexual \nye had not reached all of the vic-\nat this point.

Ultimately, \naccording to a source within the Palm Beach PD, the department \nwould identify forty-seven underage girls who'd been molested \non El Brillo Way. \nRecarey interviewed one of Epstein's pilots, a man named \nDavid Rogers, as well as Epstein's houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. \nHe also spoke to a woman who really was a massage therapist. \nIt turned out that Epstein paid just one hundred dollars for \nactual Swedish deep-tissue massages that the therapist provided \nfor him and his friends, the lawyer Alan Dershowitz among \nthem. \nDid anything untoward ever happen? Recarey asked. Had \npstein ever asked the woman to rub his chest? \n161 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nNo, she told him. She wasn't Epstein's type. The girls she'd \nseen at his house were very thin and beautiful and did not have \ntattoos. This massage therapist had several tattoos that were vis-\nible, and on quite a few occasions Epstein and Ghislaine Max-\nwell had made negative comments about them. \nAccording to a Palm Beach Police Department Incident Report \nfiled by Recarey on July 25, 2006, the detective had also heard \nfrom Mary's father, who said that a private eye had been to his \nhouse, photographing his family and chasing visitors away. \nMary's dad had gotten the license plate—Florida E79-4EG. \nRecarey traced it back to one Ivan Robles of West Palm Beach. \nRobles turned out to be a licensed private investigator. \nRecarey informed the state's attorney's office. \nAlison also contacted Recarey and told him that she'd been \napproached by someone who was in touch with Epstein. Alison \nhad been told that she'd receive money if she would refuse to \ncooperate with the police. \nThose who help him will be compensated, she was told, \naccording to Detective Recarey's incident report. \"And those who \nhurt him will be dealt with.\" \nRecarey reassured the girl and told her that tampering with a \nwitness in a case like this was a serious, arrestable offense. \nThen he told an assistant state attorney. \nThe detective was leaving no i undotted and no t uncrossed. \nBut he did wonder if the state attorney's office itself had \nbecome part of the problem. \nBarry Krischer: April \nState attorney Barry l \nbefore taking his post \nin and around Palm \n1992 and 1996, he had run \nand 2004.

Elected twice to his office, in \n1992 and 1996, he had run unopposed for state attorney in 2000 \nand 2004. During the course of his long career, which began in \n1970 with a three-year stint in the district attorney's office in \nBrooklyn, he received a number of awards: the pro bono award \nfrom the Legal Aid Society of Palm Beach County for his service \nwith the juvenile justice system and for his work with the child \nprotection team; the Peace at Home award, presented by Gover-\nnor jeb Bush, for his work with victims of family violence; a life-\ntime achievement award from the Florida Bar. He was a board \nmember of the National District Attorneys Association. And he \nwas not necessarily averse to going after the rich and powerful. \nIn 2003, he launched an investigation into Rush Limbaugh's use \n163 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nof, and means of obtaining, oxycodone and hydrocodone. (A few \nyears after Limbaugh's arrest, which coincided with Chief Reit-\ner's investigation into Jeffrey Epstein, the talk-show host settled \nwith prosecutors, agreed to submit to random drug testing, and \ngave up his firearms permit.) \nKrischer himself, however, had been accused of sexual \nmisconduct. \nIn October of 1992, Jodi Bergeron, a legal secretary who'd worked \nfor Krischer, filed a sexual harassment lawsuit against him in the \nPalm Beach County circuit court. That suit was dismissed, but a few \nmonths later, the woman took Krischer to federal court, accusing \nhim of making unwanted advances and demanding recompense for \nbattery, negligence, invasion of privacy, and emotional distress. \nKrischer had placed his hands, violently, inside her blouse, \nthe woman said. He'd forcibly fondled her breasts, forcibly kissed \nher, and rubbed her shoulders while brushing her buttocks with \nhis hands and knees, all while accompanying the gestures with \nverbal advances. \nWhen she declined those advances, the woman claimed, \nKrischer fired her. \nKrischer denied the allegations. At the time, he was making his \nfirst run for the state attorney's office. The charges were politically \nmotivated, he said. Members of a local chapter of NOW—the \nNational Organization for Women—had stood by the lawyer, cit-\ning his efforts to stop domestic violence, among his other virtues. \n\"I am here to support Barry Krischer for the work his office \ndid in my daughter's case,\" one woman said during a rally that \ntook place in front of the courthouse. \"Her murderer received \nthe maximum sentence, a life sentence.\" \nThe second lawsuit had also been dismissed— after Krischer's \n164 \nformer law firm agreed \nsand dollars in legal fees \nNow Chief Reiter and D( \ntheir own questions abc \nwanted to charge Epsteil \nbehavior and four cour \nminor—felony charges \nbehind bars in the case c \nKellen would be charged \nThis was not, the plai \nfor Jeffrey Epstein. \nIn cases involving tl. \nattorneys tend to have s \nBut instead of granting I \nthe police that he would \nasked to consider a broad \nIn a case such as Epst€ \ning in and of itself.

The Palm Beach PD \nwanted to charge Epstein with one count of lewd and lascivious \nbehavior and four counts of unlawful sexual activity with a \nminor—felony charges that would have amounted to years \nbehind bars in the case of a conviction. Wendy Dobbs and Sarah \nKellen would be charged as accomplices. \nThis was not the plan that Krischer seemed to have in mind \nfor Jeffrey Epstein. \nIn cases involving the sexual abuse of minors, prosecuting \nattorneys tend to have suspects arrested, then push for a trial. \nBut instead of granting his approval for an arrest, Krischer told \nthe police that he would convene a grand jury, which would be \nasked to consider a broad range of charges. \nIn a case such as Epstein's, this was highly unusual. Not damn-\ning in and of itself. But very strange. In Florida, grand juries are \nonly required in capital cases. At the state attorney's discretion, they \nmay also be called in controversial cases—for instance, cases \ninvolving crimes committed by public officials. But Jeffrey Epstein \nwasn't a public official, and as far as the Palm Beach PD was con-\ncerned, the only controversial thing about the case they'd built was \nthat Epstein was rich and well connected. In his deposition for \nB.B. vs. Epstein, Chief Reiter rel ayed Krischer's concerns: the pros-\necutor had to make sure that his case was solid, beyond a reason-\nable doubt. And Krischer did have his doubts about the credibility \nof the young women who'd be called to testify against Epstein. \n165 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nEven so, Reiter was beginning to wonder if Krischer was \nstacking the deck in Epstein's favor—if, thanks to the sway \nprosecutors have over grand juries, assembling such a jury \nwasn't an excellent way to let Epstein off with the lightest pun-\nishment possible. \nAnother unusual thing: the way Barry Krischer and the law-\nyers working for him ignored Chief Reiter's multiple phone calls \nas well as Detective Recarey's— even though the police had been \nhearing from Epstein's own lawyers. \n\"[Krischer] and I had an excellent relationship,\" Chief Reiter \nsaid in his deposition. \"I was the speaker at his swearing-in cere-\nmony. And that he wouldn't return my phone calls—I mean, it \nwas clear to me by his actions that he could not objectively look \nat this case.\" \nIn the incident report he ended up writing, Detective Recarey \nremembered a phone call that he received from Guy Fronstin, \none of the lawyers representing Epstein. \nIt was a message Epstein wanted to send, something central to \nthe case that demanded explanation. The whole shit show swirling \naround him was just a misunderstanding—a misrepresentation—\nof Epstein's actual interests and intentions. \nFronstin says Mr. Epstein is very passionate about massages, \nDetective Recarey would write. \nAnd: Mr. Epstein had donated over $100,000 to the Ballet o \nFlorida for massages. \nAnd: The massages are therapeutic and spiritually sound for \nhim.

Messages \nwere left on their voicemail. On April 17, 2006, during the \nhours of 9:00 am and 11:30 am I again left messages for ASA \nWeiss and ASA Belohlavek for either of them to return my \ncall as I had not heard from the State Attorney's Office as to \nthe time and date of the Grand Jury. \nAt approximately 12:30 pm, I went to the State Attor-\nney's Office and Located ASA Weiss and ASA Belohlavek in \ntheir offices. I entered ASA Belohlavek's office who informed \nme that she was going to return my call. She explained that \nan offer was made to the Defense, Atty Guy Fronstin and \n167 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nAtty Alan Dershowitz. The offer is 1 count of Agg Assault \nwith intent to commit a felony, five years probation, with \nadjudication withheld. Epstein would have to submit to psy-\nchiatric/sexual evaluation and no unsupervised visits with \nminors. When asked about all the other victims, ASA \nBelohlavek stated that was the only offer made as to one vic-\ntim, [Mary]. ASA Belohlaveles] cell phone rang and went to \nvoice mail. She checked her voice mail and played the mes-\nsage on speaker. The caller identified himself as Atty Guy \nFronstin and acknowledged the deal made between them. \nFronstin stated in the message, he spoke with his client, Jef-\nfrey Epstein, and would agree to this deal. Fronstin asked to \ncall off the grand jury as they would accept this deal. \nBelohlavek stated a probable cause would be needed to book \nEpstein in the county Jail and would let me know as to when \nit was needed. I explained my disapproval of the deal and not \nbeing consulted prior to the deal being offered. However I \nexpressed that was only my opinion and the final approval \nwould come from the Chief of Police. She explained to have \nChief Reiter call Barry Krischer about the deal. I left the \narea and returned to the police station where I briefed the \nChief about the deal offered. \nI checked my voice mail messages and discovered a mes-\nsage from [the] stepmother for the victim [Mary]. She was \ncalling because the State Attorney's Office still had not \nreturned any of her calls as to when they are needed for this \ncase. I then called ASA Belohlavek's office and left messages \nfor her to call the victims on this case and explain to them \nwhat the State Attorney's Office had done. \n168 \nMichael Reiter: May 2( \nA plea offer? \nChief Reiter is o \nsands of hours of wc \nevidence.

His team has logged thou-\nsands of hours of work. They've assembled mountains of \nevidence. But instead of going to trial, the state attorney wants to \nsee Epstein get off with a misdemeanor, five years of probation, \nand a psych exam. \nWhy? \nAlan Dershowitz has presented the prosecutors with his own \npieces of evidence—printouts from the victims' Myspace pages. \nIn her \"About Me\" column, under \"Best physical feature,\" \nMary has written \"Ass and eyes.\" \nUnder \"Ever drank\" and \"Ever smoked pot,\" she's written \n\"Yeah.\" \nUnder \"Ever shoplifted\": \"Lots.\" \nUnder \"Ever skinny dipped\": \"Yeah.\" \n69 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nUnder \"[Do] you wanna lose your virginity\": \"I already lost it.\" \nOne of the victims has been caught with drugs and arrested. \nShe's also been caught stealing from Victoria's Secret. From the \nstate attorney's perspective, these girls look like compromised \nwomen. And if what they say about Epstein is true, wouldn't that \nmake them prostitutes? \nAs witnesses, they would be weak, while the lawyers on \nEpstein's side were exceptionally strong. \nAlan Dershowitz had represented Claus von Billow, the Brit-\nish socialite who was acquitted of the murder of his wife, Sunny. \nDershowitz had been on 0. J. Simpson's team when the former \nfootball star was acquitted of the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole \nBrown Simpson and Nicole's friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. And \nrich as von Billow and Simpson had been, neither one had had \nthe resources that Epstein was willing and able to deploy in his \nown defense. \nNeither of them had been intimate friends with his lawyer. \nAs far as Reiter was concerned, none of that mattered. Even if \nEpstein thought that the girls he'd molested were eighteen years \nold—even if they had lied to him—it didn't matter under Flor-\nida law. The chief grew worried that in Epstein's case exceptions \nwere being made, and he grew even more concerned with each \nunreturned call that he made to the state attorney's office. \nOn May 1, the Palm Beach PD asked the state attorney's office \nto issue an arrest warrant for Jeffrey Epstein. \nThat same day, Chief Reiter took the extraordinary step of \nwriting Barry Krischer a letter all but demanding that he recuse \nhimself from the case. \n170 \nTOWN OF \nPOLICE 13 \nA NATiONAL STMT.

Let me show you what we'll mark as exhibit 3. Let \nme give you a chance to read through this letter again to help \nrefresh your recollection. \nA: I've read it. \nQ: At this point, in May of 2006, I'm assuming based on what \nyou told us before that you had had some conversations with \nBarry Krischer directly. ...by phone—correct? —prior to this \nletter. \nA: I had conversations in person and by phone. \nQ: Okay. But nonetheless in May—May 1, 2006—you felt the \nneed to write this letter; is that correct? \nA: Yes. \n172 \nQ: Can you tell us why? \nA: Well, I felt the handling-.. \nway the state attorney's ofi \nunusual.

Well, I know tl \nstatute that addresses tho \nQ: \n\fFILTHY RICH \nQ: \nA: \nQ: \nCan you tell us why? \nWell, I felt the handling—and just continued to feel that the \nway the state attorney's office handled this case was extremely \nunusual. I knew that Mr. Krischer was making decisions \nabout this case. I felt that his objectivity was lacking, and I \nfelt that the appropriate way, after reading the statute that \ngoverned the assignment of cases to other circuits—I felt \nthat his action met the standard. I used some of the words \nfrom the statute in here. And I attempted to call him, and he \nwouldn't return my phone calls. \nThe detective attempted to contact—his contact in the \nstate attorney's office, Lanna Belohlavek, however you pro-\nnounce that ... and she wouldn't return his calls. So I wrote \nthe letter in hope that he would think about his situation and \nrealize that his objectivity was insufficient to prosecute the \ncase and ask the governor to appoint someone else. And I felt \nlike that was necessary for a fair prosecution of our case that \nhad been submitted to him. \nCould you tell us, explain to us, why you felt that his objec-\ntivity may be lacking in regards to this prosecution ... ? In \nother words, what evidence did you see here, uncover, that \nyou felt made it potentially nonobjective? \nA: Well ... when I first told him about the case, and I realized \nthat it was a serious case, [that] there were multiple victims, \n[and] that the suspect was very well known, I told him about \nit. And we were—it was in person. I talked to him after a \nmeeting that he and I were both involved in. And I had \nknown him to be a victim advocate and to protect the rights \nof children. Well, I know that he even wrote a portion of the \nstatute that addresses those issues. And when I told him \n173 \nCHAPTER 45 \nMichael Reiter in B.B. vs. \nainst Jeffrey Epstein: \na letter to state attorney Barry \na what we'll mark as exhibit 3. Let \nad through this letter again to help \n1006, I'm assuming based on what \nu had had some conversations with \nby phone —correct? —prior to this \nrson and by phone. \ni May—May 1, 2006—y0u felt the \nis that correct? \n172 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \noriginally, he said, \"Let's go for it; this is an adult male in his \nfifties who's had sexual contact with children of the ages of \nthe victims.\" He said this is somebody who we have to stop. \nAnd whatever we need, he said, in the state attorney's office, \nwe have a unit that's equipped to investigate and prosecute \nthese kinds of cases. And I didn't have too many facts early \non when I talked with him, but I knew that there were multi-. \npie victims and to our detectives they were believable. So \nwhen time went on and Mr. Epstein became aware of the \ninvestigation and his lawyers contacted the state attorney's \noffice, they told me that. \nAnd from that point on, and I believe it was Mr. Dershow-\nitz initially, the tone and tenor of the discussions of this case \nwith Mr. Krischer changed completely. [At] one point he sug-\ngested that we write [Epstein] a notice to appear, which \nwould be for a misdemeanor. He just completely changed \nfrom not only our first conversation about this( —when] he \ndidn't know the name Jeffrey Epstein— till when he had \nbeen informed on Mr. Epstein's reputation and his wealth, \nand I just thought that very unusual. \nI feel like I know him or knew him very well, the state \nattorney, and I just felt like he could not objectively make \ndecisions about this case: that is why I wrote it. \n174 \nDetective Recarey: May \nChief Reiter's letter to ti \neffect. \nKrischer did not \narrest warrant was issued.

No \narrest warrant was issued. And on the afternoon of May 3, Detec-\ntive Recarey received a telephone call from assistant state attor-\n.ney Daliah Weiss, who advised him that she had been taken off \nthe Epstein case. \nWeiss had been the perfect person to prosecute Epstein. As a \nmember of the special victims unit, she focused on sex crimes \nand crimes against children, prosecuting high-profile cases involv-\ning rape, aggravated child abuse, and neglect. But Epstein had \nadded another lawyer, a man named Jack Goldberger, and made \nGoldberger his attorney of record. \nGoldberger was friendly with Barry Krischer— and an asso-\nciate of Goldberger's was married to Daliah Weiss. \n175 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nFILTI \nIf Epstein's legal team had wanted to remove Weiss from the \ncase, this would have been a good way to do it. \nNine days later, Detective Recarey met with ASA Lanna \nBelohlavek, who told him that her boss, Barry Krischer, had asked \nher again to take the case to the grand jury. Recarey told Belohlavek \nthat he had already requested arrest warrants for Epstein, Sarah Kel-\nlen, and Wendy Dobbs. The Palm Beach PD had finished its investi-\ngation months earlier, he said, and had been waiting since then for \nthe case to move forward. He asked her once more to issue the war-\nrants. Once again Belohlavek declined, saying that the original offer \nher office had made to Epstein's old lawyer had been resubmitted to \nthe new lawyer. When Epstein's reply came, she would call. \nWhile waiting for that call, Recarey received several calls \nfrom Mary's father, who told him that he was being followed by a \ngreen Chevrolet Monte Carlo— tailed so aggressively that other \nvehicles were being run off the road. Recarey ran the plates and \nfound that the Chevy was registered to one Zachary Bechard of \nJupiter, Florida. \nBechard was a licensed private eye. \n\"A funny thing happened in Palm Beach,\" says Tim Malloy, who \nwas working as a TV newscaster in South Florida at the time. \n\"This would have been right around the time that Michael \nReiter sent his letter asking Barry Krischer to recuse himself \nfrom the case. I didn't even know what Epstein looked like, \nreally, at the time. We had pictures taken by the British tabloids, \nwhere the link to Prince Andrew first broke. But we didn't have \ntoo many of them. What we did have was a contact in the hangar \nwhere Epstein kept his 727. \n176 \n\"I don't know how much y \nnational Airport.

So thanks to him, we \nhad the 727's tail number, and thanks to one other source—\nsomeone I won't say too much about here—we had Epstein's \nflight plan for a certain trip he was making. We knew he was \ngoing to land at the airport. And so our producer climbed into \nthe station's traffic helicopter and told the pilot to hover at five \nhundred feet a quarter mile south of the field. \n\"Our cameraman had a telephoto lens. The idea was to get a \ntight shot, on video, of Epstein deplaning. And for a moment we \ndid get the shot: Epstein, with the collar of his cashmere coat \nflipped up over his neck, about to run down the steps into a cart \nthat was waiting for him. \n\"Then he saw our helicopter, with the station's markings. \n\"I was doing a live voice-over on Epstein's arrival. It was the \nfirst video anyone had on him up to that point. But Epstein had \nrun back onto the plane. Then, during the next commercial \nbreak, my producer told me through my headpiece: 'Jeffrey \nEpstein wants us to stop taking his picture. In fact, he wants to \ntalk to you.' \n\"The cameraman kept rolling. And eventually Epstein got \n_out, got into a car with tinted windows, and was driven over the \n177 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nbridge to his home in Palm Beach. So in a sense we failed to get \nthe story. But the fact that Epstein would call a news program \nfrom his plane and command them to order the program's traffic \nhelicopter away—that says something about the man's arro-\ngance.

One had been \nconvened for July 19. \nOn July 12, Recarey spoke with Mary's stepmother, who said \nthat she still hadn't heard from the state attorney's office. This, \ntoo, was odd, since Recarey knew that Mary would be called \nupon to testify. \nShe was back in Palm Beach now, after months of living with \nout-of-state relatives. \nAll in all, it had been a very tough year for Mary. \n\"What has happened to my daughter's life is criminal,\" her \nfather would say. \nMary had been sent to a school for troubled children. For \nher it was the wrong place at the worst time in her life. She had \n179 \n178 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \ngotten into more fights there, growing depressed and withdrawn \nfrom her sister and parents. Helplessly, her parents watched her \nspiral out of control. As they neared the end of their rope, they \nsent her out of state. But after the move, Mary had fallen apart \ncompletely. She used drugs, fell in with a bad crowd, ran away \nfrom her relatives, and shacked up with a gang of drug dealers. \nWhen the gang was busted by local police, the dealers blamed \nMary for snitching and put out the word that they wanted her \ndead. \n\"We had to move her again,\" Mary's father explained. \"We \nfinally got her into therapy—she's still seeing the therapist. And \nworst of all, she developed HPV. She's already had to have a seri-\nous operation.\" \nMary's troubles didn't end there. On June 28, she was brought \nin front of the grand jury. She hadn't been briefed by the state \nattorney—she hadn't even met the prosecutors—and she had \nno idea what she would be asked. \nAlmost immediately, she found that she was being treated \nmore like a criminal than like a witness or victim. \n\"The prosecutor produced a printout of our daughter's \nMyspace page,\" Mary's father recalls. \"Mary was stunned. She \nbegan to cry. The prosecutor accused her of all sort of things; it \nwas like she was working for Epstein. \n\"All this time, we knew that we were being watched. Creepy \nguys. Private investigators from Miami. They would follow us, \nscaring the hell out of my wife and Mary's sister. My car was van-\ndalized.

Everyone in the courtroom seemed to be \nplaying defense on the side of Jeffrey Epstein. And as for the sec-\nond girl—Alison, who claimed that she had been raped—she \nnever testified in court at all. \n181 \n\fCHAPTER 48 \nMichael Reiter: July 2006 \n0 n July 28, the grand jury reached a verdict that floored \nthe Palm Beach PD. \nThe original plea deal that Krischer had offered to \nEpstein had been bad enough. Now the grand jury was recom-\nmending that Epstein be charged with just one felony count of \nsolicitation of prostitution. \nThere was no mention of underage girls. The original \naccusation— four felony counts of unlawful sex acts with minors \nand one felony count of lewd and lascivious molestation—had \nsimply evaporated. \nIt wasn't enough to send Epstein to prison. \nEpstein was allowed to surrender on a Sunday, when no one \nwould know he'd been arraigned. A few hours later, he was \nreleased on three thousand dollars bail. \nThe Palm Beach PD was not even notified. \n182 \nOnce again, Chief Reite \ntook the extraordinary stej \nprosecutor's office. \nAt the time, the federal \nFlorida was a Republican \nReiter recalls being presen \nand remembers Acosta's de( \nbe the prosecution, to the \nwho takes advantage of th \nsex crimes.

So much so that he \ntook the extraordinary step of calling the FBI and the federal \nprosecutor's office. \nAt the time, the federal prosecutor of the Southern District of \nFlorida was a Republican named R. Alexander Acosta. Chief \nReiter recalls being present at Acosta's swearing-in ceremony \nand remembers Acosta's declaration that one of his goals would \nbe the prosecution, to the fullest extent of the law, of anyone \nwho takes advantage of the weak—especially perpetrators of \nsex crimes. Disgusted with Krischer's laissez-faire attitude, Reiter \nrecalls thinking he'd found his man. \nIn Acosta, the chief saw a prosecutor who wouldn't shy away \nfrom confronting a man with Jeffrey Epstein's resources and \nconnections. \nBut it turned out that Acosta had worked under Ken Starr at \nStarr's high-powered multinational law firm, Kirkland & Ellis. \nAnd while Acosta had a sterling resume, which included a stint \nclerking for future Supreme Court justice Samuel Alito, he had \nonly argued two cases before a judge. \nAt the time, Reiter did not know this. All he knew was that some-\none had to look much more seriously into Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. \nReiter's actions did not necessarily make him a hero—at least, \nnot in every corner of the community he served. \n\"I had individuals suggest that the department's approach to \nthe investigation and my referral of the investigation to the FBI \nwas more horsepower than the investigation deserved. And I \nhad other individuals suggest that—yeah, the term 'back off' \nProbably fits,\" Reiter said in his deposition for B.B. vs. Epstein. \n183 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \n\"My responsibility was to \nBeach and preserve their con: \ndepartment for all,\" Reiter sai \nparticularly under the crimin \nthe nature of our system, be ti \nBut along with handing t \nattorney, Reiter took another \nletters—on Palm Beach PD I \nvictims in the case. \nHe delivered the letters by \n\"I had people in the community in Palm Beach who either made \ncomments directly to me or to others who relayed them to me that I \ndidn't need to take the tack in the investigation that we did, which is \n[to] completely investigate it and then refer it to • the FBI after the \nstate case was resolved,\" Reiter said in the deposition. \"I had one \nindividual who came to see me a couple of times about this.\" \nAccording to the chief, the individual in question was a \nprominent Palm Beach politician. \n\"He said this wasn't necessary; this was a case that was really \nvery minor,\" Reiter recalled. \"The victims had lifestyles that \ndon't make them—shouldn't make them believable to the police \ndepartment.\" \n\"I told him that those kinds of suggestions to me were \nimproper and he should stop,\" said Reiter. \"That he had taken a \ncouple of steps down the road toward something that could \neventually constitute a crime. We talked several times. Early on \nit didn't end favorably. You know, this is an individual [whom] I \nhad to interact with in my official capacity and in his official \ncapacity as well.\" \nThe Palm Beach politician wasn't the only one to pressure \nthe police chief. \"I received comments from a variety of different \nviewpoints ... in some cases I had people tell me, hey, he's a Palm \nBeacher, why are you investigating a Palm Beacher?\" Reiter \nwould say when deposed. \"I had people that said it was an unfa-\nvorable career move for me to ask the state attorney to remove \nhimself from the case and to refer it to the FBI.... I had plenty of \npeople that told me that that was a mistake.\" \nReiter didn't back off.

He wrote personal \nletters—on Palm Beach PD letterhead— to the parents of the \nvictims in the case. \nHe delivered the letters by hand. \n185 \n\fTOWN OF PALM BEACH \nPOLICE DEPARTMENT \nA NixitcNixt.

He sent sexually charged messages to a Boyn-\nton Beach police officer who was pretending to be a fifteen-year-old \nboy. But in a sense, Blake was lucky: he could have been sen-\ntenced to life. The case was an interesting example of the kind of \ntreatment regular Florida folks could expect just for soliciting sex \nwith a minor. But nothing about Jeffrey Epstein was regular--\n- \nand the plea deal he managed to strike in 2007 was simply \nextraordinary. \nEpstein had bought himself one of the best defense teams ever \nassembled. His connections and contributions to Democratic \n187 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nFILT \ncauses had made him a player on that side of the political aisle. He \nhad a famous Republican, Bill Clinton's nemesis, Ken Starr, work-\ning the other side. And just to make sure they'd covered the bases, \nEpstein's team also recruited Roy Black— the lawyer who'd \ncleared William Kennedy Smith of rape and kept Rush Limbaugh \nout of prison for his alleged illegal drug use—and Jay Lefkowitz, \na defense attorney who'd worked with US attorney R. Alexander \nAcosta at Ken Starr's law firm. \nAnd so in September, the US attorney's office reached a for-\nmal agreement with Epstein's team: the United States would \ndefer federal prosecution in favor of prosecution by the state of \nFlorida. \nA non-prosecution agreement (NPA) was drafted; among \nother things, it assured Epstein that he would not be prosecuted \nin the Southern District of Florida for felony offenses involving \nthe sexual abuse of underage girls. (By that point, thirty known \nvictims had been discovered.) Instead it allowed him to plead \nguilty to state felony offenses for solicitation of prostitution and \nthe procurement of minors for prostitution. The NPA established \na procedure that allowed Epstein's victims to sue him in civil \ncourt and took the extraordinary step of ensuring that \"any \npotential co-conspirators\" of Epstein's would be immune from \nprosecution. \n\"In consideration of Epstein's agreement to plead guilty and \nto provide compensation in the manner described above, if \nEpstein successfully fulfills all of the terms and conditions of \nthis agreement, the United States also agrees that it will not \ninstitute any criminal charges against any potential co-conspira-\ntors of Epstein,\" the agreement stated, mentioning Sarah Kellen \nand Nadia Marcinkova by name. \n188 \n\"The parties anticipate tha \npart of any public record,\" I \nUnited States receives a Freed \nany compulsory process comm \nment, it will provide notice \ndisclosure.\" \nRemarkably, despite assur \nfeds, none of the victims was ( \nthis NPA. \nIf Epstein did not sign the \ncount indictment and a decade \nteam of lawyers had gotten him \nted all the teeth in South Florid; \nFor all his protestations of it \nin the world to agree to an NPA. \nOn September 24, 2007, Eps. \nOnce again, none of the I \nnotified. \n189 \n\f'TERSON \nFILTHY RICH \nthat side of the political aisle.

But Epstein's \nteam of lawyers had gotten him a deal so sweet it could have rot-\nted all the teeth in South Florida. \nFor all his protestations of innocence, there was every reason \nin the world to agree to an NPA. \nOn September 24, 2007, Epstein did sign it. \nOnce again, none of the victims had been consulted or \nnotified. \n189 \n\f1 \nCHAPTER SO \nJane Doe: February 2008 \nAs a result of the non-prosecution agreement, a fifty-three-\ncount indictment that federal prosecutors had prepared \nagainst Jeffrey Epstein—one that claimed he'd abused \ndozens of underage women—never was filed. \nBut as far as lawyers representing Epstein's victims were con-\ncerned, the fact that those victims were not consulted about the \nnon-prosecution agreement was inexcusable. The \"government \ndeliberately kept crime victims 'in the dark' so that it could enter \ninto a plea arrangement designed to prevent the victims from \nraising any objections,\" they would argue, in documents filed on \nFebruary 10, 2016. For nine months, the lawyers claimed, from \nthe time that the NPA was signed, on September 24, 2007, \nKrischer's office, \"doing Epstein's bidding, [had] concealed the \nNPA's existence from victim[s]\" and continued to do so until the \n190 \nmoment that Epstein had \nfinally did June 30, 2008. \nIn the interim, accordi \nwere only told, \"This case i \nA lawsuit that Bradley I \nFort Lauderdale, filed in ji \nRights Act, or CVRA (tith \nwhich states that \"victims \ning the right to be heard ii \nbe precluded from court pr \nfairly.\" \nAccording to him, pros( \nof the victims.

Edwards, who said he was working pro bono, \nknew that this suit against the government would not allow for \nmonetary recovery of any sort (including lawyers' fees). But he \nalso knew that if the government, urged by Jeffrey Epstein, had \nentered into a contract that improperly or illegally violated the \nrights of Epstein's victims, then that contract, by nature, would \nhave been improper in and of itself—in which case, the only \nremedy would have been to have the contract invalidated. And \nwhile it is difficult to know what, exactly, would happen if the \ncontract is overturned, one possibility is that the government \ncould prosecute Epstein for crimes against his victims, if the \nstatute of limitations on those crimes has not expired. \nAt the time of this writing, that case is winding its way \nthrough the courts. It has all the earmarks of a modern-day \nBleak House........ the Charles Dickens novel about a legal case that \nis so massive and so complex that it drags on forever and drags \neveryone involved into the mire. \n191 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \n* * * \nIn the meantime, Epstein began to settle out of court with his \nvictims. \nIn February of 2008, a Virginia woman who went by the alias \nJane Doe #2 brought a fifty-million-dollar lawsuit against Epstein. \nAt the time of their meeting, she claimed, Epstein was fifty-two \nyears old. She was a teenager, and her complaint, which was \nmade public, gave the rest of the world an early glimpse of what \nEpstein, and the inner workings of his secret world, looked like \nfrom a victim's perspective. \n\"Epstein is a financier and money manager with a secret cli-\nentele limited exclusively to billionaires,\" the lawsuit alleged. \n\"He is himself a man of tremendous wealth, power and influ-\nence. He maintains his principal home in New York and also \nowns residences in New Mexico, St. Thomas and Palm Beach, \nFL. The allegations herein concern Epstein's conduct while at his \nlavish estate in Palm Beach.\" The complaint continued: \nUpon information and belief, Epstein has a sexual preference \nand obsession for underage minor girls. He engaged in a plan \nand scheme in which he gained access to primarily economi-\ncally disadvantaged minor girls in his home, sexually \nassaulted these girls, and then gave them money. In or about \n2004-2005, Jane Doe, then approximately 16 years old, fell \ninto Epstein's trap and became one of his victims. \nUpon information and belief, Jeffrey Epstein carried out \nhis schemes and assaulted girls in Florida, New York, and on \nhis private Island, known as Little St. James, in St. Thomas. \nEpstein's scheme involved the use of young girls to recruit \n192 \nunderage girls.

(Upon information and belief, the young girl \nwho brought Jane Doe to Epstein was herself a minor victim \nof Epstein, and will therefore not be named in this Com-\nplaint.) Under Epstein's plan, underage girls were recruited \nostensibly to give a wealthy man a massage for monetary \ncompensation in his Palm Beach mansion. The recruiter \nwould be contacted when Epstein was planning to be at his \nPalm Beach residence or soon after he had arrived there. \nEpstein or someone on his behalf would direct the recruiter \nto bring one or more underage girls to the residence. The \nrecruiter, upon information and belief, generally sought out \neconomically disadvantaged underaged girls from western \nPalm Beach County who would be enticed by the money \nbeing offered—generally $200 to $300 per \"massage\" \nsession—and who were perceived as less likely to complain \nto authorities or have credibility if allegations of improper \nconduct were made. This was an important element of \nEpstein's plan. \nEpstein's plan reflected a particular pattern and method. \nUpon arrival at Epstein's mansion, the underaged victim \nwould be introduced to Sarah Kellen, Epstein's assistant, who \ngathered the girl's personal information, including her name \nand telephone number. Ms. Kellen would then bring the girl \nup a flight of stairs to a bedroom that contained a massage \ntable in addition to other furnishings. There were photo-\ngraphs of nude women lining the stairway hall and in the \nbedroom. The girl would then find herself alone in the room \nwith Epstein, who would be wearing only a towel. He would \nthen remove his towel and lie naked on the massage table, \nand direct the girl to remove her clothes. Epstein would then \n193 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nperform one or more lewd, lascivious and sexual acts, \nincluding masturbation and touching the girl's vagina. \nConsistent with the foregoing plan and scheme, Jane Doe \nwas recruited to give Epstein a massage for monetary com-\npensation. Jane was brought to Epstein's mansion in Palm \nBeach. Once at the mansion, Jane was introduced to Sarah \nKellen, who led her up the flight of stairs to the room with the \nmassage table. In this room, Epstein told Jane to take off her \nclothes and give him a massage. Jane kept her panties and \nbra on and complied with Epstein's instructions. Epstein \nwore only a towel around his waste [sic]. After a short period \nof time, Epstein removed the towel and rolled over exposing \nhis penis. Epstein began to masturbate and he sexually \nassaulted Jane. \n• After Epstein had completed the assault, Jane was then \nable to get dressed, leave the room and go back down the \nstairs. Jane was paid $200 by Epstein. The young girl who \nrecruited Jane was paid $100 by Epstein for bringing Jane to \nhim. \nAs a result of this encounter with Epstein, Jane experi-\nenced confusion, shame, humiliation and embarrassment, and \nhas suffered severe psychological and emotional injuries. \n194 \nJeffrey Epstein: June 30, 2 \nn June 30, 2008, more \nOfficer Pagan's investig; \nage girls, Jeffrey Epsti \nCounty jail. \nA few days earlier, Epstein \nNew York Times.

At the time, he'd been working, or vacationing \n(the line having long since blurred), at his compound on Little \nSaint Jeff's. \n\"I respect the legal process,\" Epstein had said. \"I will abide \nby this.\" \nHe'd spent years fighting the charges—fighting the state, \nthen the federal government, in an effort to avoid a sentence that \nwould have seen him emerge from prison an old man. But the \nbattle had aged him. Mellowed him, even. Months earlier, he had \nall but boasted to a journalist from New York magazine. \n195 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \n\"It's the Icarus story, someone who flies too close to the sun,\" \nthat journalist said in reference to \"the agony\" of Epstein's legal \n\"ordeal.\" \n\"Did Icarus like massages?\" Epstein responded. \nBut after Epstein's indictment, there were no more boasts. \nFor the most part, he kept silent in public and retreated into his \nEyes Wide Shut world. And when the New York Times did manage \nto get him to speak on the record, he spoke like a chastened man. \nSitting on his patio down on Little St. James, Epstein likened \nhimself to the shipwrecked Gulliver after he washes ashore on \nLilliput. \n\"Gulliver's playfulness had unintended consequences,\" he said. \nOn the eve of his departure, he had a few more things to say: \n\"That is what happens with wealth. There are unexpected \nburdens as well as benefits....\" \n\"Your body can be confined, but not your mind....\" \n\"I am not blameless....\" \nOutside of the agreement he'd signed with the prosecutor's \noffice, this was the closest Epstein had come to admitting his \nguilt. But strange details were sprinkled throughout the story. \nHe had formed a \"board of directors of friends\" who would coun-\nsel him on his behavior. And, seemingly for the first time, he'd \nhired a full-time masseur—a man. \nReaders of the New York Times might have wondered: Epstein \nwas going to jail for eighteen months. What need would he have \nfor a full-time masseur? \nThe story's last line hinted at the answer: in preparation for \nincarceration, Epstein had set up an e-mail alert. \nFrom then on, his automatic reply would read \"On vacation.\" \n196 \n\fTERSON \nPART V \nIncarceration \nwho flies too close to the sun,\" \no \"the agony\" of Epstein's legal \npstein responded. \nit, there were no more boasts. \nin public and retreated into his \nthe New York Times did manage \n, he spoke like a chastened man. \nLittle St. James, Epstein likened \nliver after he washes ashore on \nintended consequences,\" he said. \nle had a few more things to say: \nwealth.

Epstein's \nhome on El Brillo Way is five miles to the east. Mary's high \nschool is several miles to the west. \nIt's fitting, somehow, that this jail—which is the jail Epstein \nends up in, after turning himself in to the local sheriff—lies in \nbetween the two points. \nThe detention center's inmates, their families, and their law-\nyers call it the Gun Club, a reference not only to the jail's address, \non Gun Club Road, but also to its population of hustlers, bur-\nglars, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. There's the occa-\nsional hooker as well. And, from time to time, Haitian refugees \nare lodged there. \nThere are three thousand inmates in all. \n199 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nSome wait a year before making their way to the courthouse, \ntheir date with the public defender, and an appearance before \nthe judge. Some get out much sooner, if only they can make bail. \nBut there's no bail without money—or at least collateral—and, \nof course, being without money is often what lands people in jail \nin the first place. \nJeffrey Epstein could have posted bail for every single inmate \nin the Gun Club. \nBut that's just one of the ways in which Epstein is unlike his \nfellow inmates. He's an admitted pedophile now. Even a famous one. \nAnd, famously, pedophiles tend to fare poorly in jail. \nLuckily for Epstein, Ric Bradshaw, the sheriff in charge of \nlocal jails, transfers Epstein to the infirmary, where he spends \nexactly one night before being transferred seven miles up the \nroad to a much smaller, safer location: the Palm Beach County \nCentral Detention Center—or, as it's known, the Stockade. \n\"It's not somewhere we'd put a serial killer,\" Ric Bradshaw says. \nMost of the residents here are addicts who take part in drug \neducation programs, prostitutes, petty criminals, and drunks. \nIt's a far safer place for Epstein to be, and, unlike other inmates \n(except, of course, those being held in solitary), he'll end up with \nhis own cell, even his own wing, which he has to himself. \nEpstein's allowed to pay for a security guard, who sits outside the \ncell and keeps watch. And he's allowed any number of visitors. \nFor a convicted felon, it's an extraordinary benefits package. \nBut according to Sheriff Bradshaw, who also oversees the Stock-\nade, Epstein is incredulous over the treatment he is receiving. \n\"He was astonished that he had to go to prison at all,\" Brad-\nshaw remembers. \n\"Let's just say he didn't think he belonged there.\" \n200 \n*et \nSheriff Ric Bradshaw: June \n0 ur job,\" says Ric Bradsl \nkilled him.\" \nSheriff Bradshaw co \nWestern.

Imposingly tall, with his cowboy hat, Kurt Russell \nmustache, and slow, southern drawl, he looks exactly like an \nold-school law officer—the kind you once would have found \npatrolling the streets of Tombstone, Deadwood, or Dodge City. \nHe's been a lawman for forty-four years, eleven of which have \nbeen spent as the head of the county's jails. As a rule, he doesn't \ntalk to the media, and today, as he talks about Jeffrey Epstein, \nhe's clearly uncomfortable, fidgety, and ill disposed. \nBut here in his wood-paneled office on the first floor of the \nGun Club, Bradshaw remembers Epstein quite well. \n\"We have a thousand sexual predators in the county,\" he \nsays. \"When he arrived here, he was one of them.

Alexander Acosta's letter to the general public, \nMarch 20, 2011 \nTo whom it may concern: \nI served as U. S. Attorney for the Southern District of Florida \nfrom 2005 through 2009. Over the past weeks, I have read \nmuch regarding Mr. Jeffrey Epstein. Some appears true, \nsome appears distorted. I thought it appropriate to provide \nsome background, with two caveats: (i) under Justice Depart-\nment guidelines, I cannot discuss privileged internal com-\nmunications among department attorneys and (ii) I no longer \nhave access to the original documents, and as the matter is \nnow nearly 4 years old, the precision of memory is reduced. \nThe Epstein matter was originally presented to the \nPalm Beach County State Attorney.

Palm Beach Police \nIlawfully hired underage high \n206 \nFILTHY RICH \nschool females to provide him sexually lewd and erotic \nmassages. Police sought felony charges that would have \nresulted in a term of imprisonment. According to press \nreports, however, in 2006 the State Attorney, in part due \nto concerns regarding the quality of the evidence, agreed \nto charge Epstein only with one count of aggravated \nassault with no intent to commit a felony. That charge \nwould have resulted in no jail time, no requirement to \nregister as a sexual offender and no restitution for the \nunderage victims. \nLocal police were dissatisfied with the State Attor-\nney's conclusions, and requested a federal investigation. \nFederal authorities received the State's evidence and \nengaged in additional investigation. Prosecutors weighed \nthe quality of the evidence and the likelihood for success \nat trial. With a federal case, there were two additional \nconsiderations. First, a federal criminal prosecution \nrequires that the crime be more than local; it must have \nan interstate nexus. Second, as the matter was initially \ncharged by the state, the federal responsibility is, to some \nextent, to back-stop state authorities to ensure that there \nis no miscarriage of justice, and not to also prosecute fed-\nerally that which has already been charged at the state \nlevel. \nAfter considering the quality of the evidence and the \nadditional considerations, prosecutors concluded that \nthe state charge was insufficient. In early summer 2007, \nthe prosecutors and agents in this case met with \nMr. Epstein's attorney, Roy Black. Mr. Black is perhaps \nbest known for his successful defense of William \n207 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nFij \nKennedy Smith. The prosecutors presented Epstein a \nchoice: plead to more serious state felony charges (that \nwould result in 2 years' imprisonment, registration as a \nsexual offender, and restitution for the victims) or else \nprepare for a federal felony trial. \nWhat followed was a year-long assault on the prose-\ncution and the prosecutors. I use the word assault inten-\ntionally, as the defense in this case was more aggressive \nthan any which I, or the prosecutors in my office, had \npreviously encountered. Mr. Epstein hired an army of \nlegal superstars: Harvard Professor Alan Dershowitz, for-\nmer Judge and then Pepperdine Law Dean Kenneth Starr, \nformer Deputy Assistant to the President and then Kirk-\nland & Ellis Partner Jay Lefkowitz, and several others, \nincluding prosecutors who had formerly worked in the \nU.S. Attorney's Office and in the Child Exploitation and \nObscenity Section of the Justice Department. Defense \nattorneys next requested a meeting with me to challenge \nthe prosecution and the terms previously presented by \nthe prosecutors in their meeting with Mr. Black. The \nprosecution team and I met with defense counsel in Fall \n2007, and I reaffirmed the office's position: two years, \nregistration and restitution, or trial. \nOver the next several months, the defense team pre-\nsented argument after argument claiming that felony \ncriminal proceedings against Epstein were unsupported \nby the evidence and lacked a basis in law, and that the \noffice's insistence on jail-time was motivated by a zeal to \novercharge a man merely because he is wealthy. They \nbolstered their arguments with legal opinions from \n208 \nwell-known legal expert \nteam warned me that th€ \ngood man to serve time • \nbook if we continued tc \noffice systematically con! \nment, and when we di \nappealed to Washington. \nThe defense strategy \nDefense counsel investiga \ntheir families, looking for \nprovide a basis for disqual \necutor is an effective (thi \neliminating the individua \nand thus most qualified to \nlihood for success.

One member of the defense \nteam warned me that the office's excess zeal in forcing a \ngood man to serve time in jail might be the subject of a \nbook if we continued to proceed with the matter. My \noffice systematically considered and rejected each argu-\nment, and when we did, my office's decisions were \nappealed to Washington. As to the warning, I ignored it. \nThe defense strategy was not limited to legal issues. \nDefense counsel investigated individual prosecutors and \ntheir families, looking for personal peccadilloes that may \nprovide a basis for disqualification. Disqualifying a pros-\necutor is an effective (though rarely used) strategy, as \neliminating the individuals most familiar with the facts \nand thus most qualified to take a case to trial harms like-\nlihood for success. Defense counsel tried to disqualify at \nleast two prosecutors. I carefully reviewed, and then \nrejected, these arguments. \nDespite the army of attorneys, the office held firm to \nthe terms first presented to Mr. Black in the original \nmeeting. On June 30, 2008, after yet another last minute \nappeal to Washington D.C. was rejected, Epstein pled \nguilty in state court. He was to serve 18 months impris-\nonment, register as a sexual offender for life, and provide \nrestitution to the victims. \nSome may feel that the prosecution should have been \ntougher. Evidence that has come to light since 2007 may \nencourage that view. Many victims have since spoken \nout, filing detailed statements in civil cases seeking dam-\nages. Physical evidence has since been discovered. Had \nthese additional statements and evidence been known, \n209 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nthe outcome may have been different. But they were not \nknown to us at the time. \nA prosecution decision must be based on admissible \nfacts known at the time. In cases of this type, those are \nunusually difficult because victims are frightened and \noften decline to testify or if they do speak, they give con-\ntradictory statements. Our judgment in this case, based \non the evidence known at the time, was that it was better \nto have a billionaire serve time in jail, register as a sex \noffender, and pay his victims restitution than risk a trial \nwith a reduced likelihood of success. I supported that \njudgment then, and based on the state law as it then stood \nand the evidence known at the time, I would support that \njudgment again. \nEpstein's treatment, while in state custody, likewise \nmay encourage the view that the office should have been \ntougher. Although the terms of confinement in a state \nprison are a matter appropriately left to the State of Flor-\nida, and not federal authorities, without doubt, the treat-\nment that he received while in state custody undermined \nthe purpose of a jail sentence. \nSome may also believe that the prosecution should \nhave been tougher in retaliation for the defense's tactics. \nThe defense, arguably, often failed to negotiate in good \nfaith. They would obtain concessions as part of a negotia-\ntion and agree to proceed, only to change their minds, \nand appeal the office's position to Washington. The inves-\ntigations into the family lives of individual prosecutors \nwere, in my opinion, uncalled for, as were the accusations \nof bias and/or misconduct against individual prosecutors. \n210 \nF: \nAt times, some prosecut \ntrial, and at times I felt t \nright in the first meetin \nspective of defense tacti \ntional right to a defense \nright should not be puni: \nsel's exercise of their ri \nWashington D.C.

The aggressive exercise of that \nright should not be punished, nor should a defense coun-\nsel's exercise of their right to appeal a U.S Attorney to \nWashington D.C. Prosecutors must be careful not to allow \nfrustration and anger with defense counsel to influence \ntheir judgment. \nAfter the plea, I recall receiving several phone calls. \nOne was from the FBI Special Agent-In-Charge. He called \nto offer congratulations. He had been at many of the \nmeetings regarding this case. He was aware of the tactics \nof the defense, and he called to praise our prosecutors for \nholding firm against the likes of Messrs. Black, Dershow-\nitz, Lefkowitz and Starr. It was a proud moment. I also \nreceived calls or communications from Messrs. Dershow-\nitz, Lefkowitz and Starr. I had known all three individu-\nals previously, from my time in law school and at \nKirkland & Ellis in the mid 90s. They all sought to make \npeace. I agreed to talk and meet with each of them after \nEpstein pled guilty, as I think it important that prosecu-\ntors battle defense attorneys in a case and then move on. I \nhave tried, yet I confess that this has been difficult to do \nfully in this case. \nThe bottom line is this: Mr. Jeffrey Epstein, a billionaire, \nserved time in jail and is now a registered sexual offender. \nHe has been required to pay his victims restitution, though \nrestitution clearly cannot compensate for the crime. And \n2/1 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nwe know much more today about his crimes because vic-\ntims have come forward to speak out. Some may disagree \nwith prosecutorial judgments made in this case, but \nthose individuals are not the ones who at the time \nreviewed the evidence available for trial and assessed the \nlikelihood of success. \n• Respectfully, \nR.

One of the concessions his lawyers have gotten \nwhile working out his plea-deal guarantees is that the media not \nbe alerted to the time and day of his departure. \nBut from now on, Epstein, who is fifty-six, will carry the \nmark of a level 3 sex offender—level 1 being the lowest, and \nlevel 3 indicating the highest possible risk of a future criminal \nact of a sexual nature. Wherever he goes, he will be forced to reg-\nister as such. \nEvery ninety days, Epstein will have to check in with the \nauthorities. Every year, the New York City Police Department \nwill take his mug shot. And for a full year, Epstein will be under \nhouse arrest in Palm Beach. \nThis last prohibition doesn't stop him from flying, with court \n215 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \napproval, on his own planes to New York and to Little Saint Jeff's, \nwhere the locals have taken to referring to Epstein's 727 as the \nLolita Express. \nThere are other restrictions, of course, that Epstein is sup-\nposed to abide by. He has to provide the state of Florida with a \nlist of all the motor vehicles, boats, and airplanes he owns. The \nfull list includes two Escalades, six Suburbans, two Ford F-150s, \ntwo Harley-Davidsons, a Land Rover, a Hummer H2, a thirty-\nfour-foot JVC boat, and a thirty-five-foot Donzi powerboat. \nThree of his five planes turn out to be registered to a com-\npany called Air Ghislaine, Inc. \nAs a registered sex offender, Epstein is legally obliged to \nundergo psychiatric treatment. This is a restriction he'll get \naround by having his own psychologist submit a report to law \nenforcement officers. \nEpstein is also prohibited from accessing pornography on \nthe Internet and using social networking for sexual purposes. \nFor Jeffrey Epstein, there will be no Bangbros, Tinder, or \nSwingles. com. \nThere will be lawsuits. \nSix weeks before probation ends, he settles with seven women \nwho sue him in civil court. But Epstein can easily afford the set-\ntlement payments. He won't be going back to jail, and in regard \nto further prosecution for any criminal actions, his troubles are \nbehind him. \nNot everyone who's spent time in his company will be so \nlucky. \n216 \nAlfredo Rodriguez: Aug \nE pstein's houseman, Al \nprison sentence. \nIn a sworn statem \nmaid, Lupita, who had comi \nup after Epstein's \"massage5 \nlic, had cried as she describe \nRodriguez was fired by I \nafter seeing a strange car— g \nAs it turned out, the ca \nmasseuses. \nOn his way out of the hc \nof Epstein's papers, which he \nby Chief Reiter's investigator. \nFor years, Rodriguez tries \nmanager.

No one wanted to hire someone who'd worked for \n217 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nJeffrey Epstein. Finally, desperately, he tried to sell the informa-\ntion he'd stolen. \nThe papers named underage girls and the places where \nEpstein had taken them. The list included locations in Califor-\nnia, Paris, New Mexico, New York, and Michigan. The papers \nalso included the names, addresses, and phone numbers of \nfamous individuals—Henry Kissinger, Mick Jagger, Dustin Hoff-\nman, Ralph Fiennes, David Koch, Ted Kennedy, Donald Trump, \nBill Richardson, Bill Clinton, and former Israeli prime minister \nEhud Barak among them. \nThis was intriguing, if not at all damning. Epstein made a \nhabit of collecting such information for future use. But informa-\ntion pertaining to the girls would have bolstered the state's case \nagainst Jeffrey Epstein, and by withholding it from the Palm \nBeach PD and the FBI, Rodriguez had committed a crime. \nIn his defense, Rodriguez would say that the papers were an \n\"insurance policy.\" Without them, he believed, Epstein would \nhave made him \"disappear.\" \nBut now Rodriguez needed the money. And so a few weeks \nafter Epstein's release from the Stockade, he approached a lawyer \nwho was representing some of Epstein's masseuses. He had the \n\"holy grail,\" he insisted.

The \nlawyer told him that an associate would be in touch. \nWhat the lawyer knew and Rodriguez did not know was that \nthe associate in question was an undercover employee (UCE) of \nthe FBI. A few days later, on November 2, the UCE calls Rodri-\nguez and sets up a meeting, which takes place the following day. \n\"During the meeting, Rodriguez produced a small bound \nbook and several sheets of legal pad paper containing handwrit-\nten notes,\" Special Agent Pryor would say in her statement. She \ncontinues: \nRodriguez explained that he had taken the bound book from \nhis former employer's residence while employed there in \n2004 to 2005 and that the book had been created by persons \nworking for his former employer. Rodriguez discussed in \ndetail the information within the book and identified import-\nant information to the UCE. In addition, Rodriguez admitted \nhe had previously lied to the FBI. Rodriguez asked the UCE \nabout the $50,000, took possession of the money, and began \ncounting it. \nRodriguez was then detained for Obstruction of Official \nProceedings, Title 18, U.S. Code, Section 1512(c), and ques-\ntioned. After Miranda warnings were administered by agents, \nRodriguez waived his rights and signed a written waiver of \nthose rights. Rodriguez admitted that he had the documents \nand book in his possession and had never turned them over \nto local law enforcement or the FBI. In addition, Rodriguez \n219 \n\fJAMES PATTERSON \nadvised he had witnessed nude girls whom he believed were \nunderage at the pool area of his former employer's home, \nknew that his former employer was engaging in sexual con-\ntact with underage girls, and had viewed pornographic \nimages of underage girls on computers in his employer's \nhome. Rodriguez was then released from custody for further \ninvestigation. \nThe items that Rodriguez had attempted to sell to the \nUCE for $50,000.00 were reviewed by an agent familiar with \nthe underlying criminal investigation. As Rodriguez had \ndescribed, the items contained information material to the \nunderlying investigation that would have been extremely use-\nful in investigatang] and prosecuting the case, including the \nnames and contact information of material witnesses and \nadditional victims. Had those items been produced in \nresponse to the inquiries of the state law enforcement officers \nor the FBI Special Agents, their contents would have been \npresented to the federal grand jury. \nFollowing his release, Alfredo Rodriguez was arrested again. \nHe appeared in court on June 18, 2010, facing charges of cor-\nruptly concealing records and documents. Dressed in a blue \njumpsuit and shackles, he apologized for his crimes and asked \nthe court to be merciful. \nHe received a sentence of eighteen months. \nIt was the same punishment that Jeffrey Epstein had gotten \nfor his crimes. But unlike Epstein, Alfredo Rodriguez served his \ntime in a federal prison and did not ask for, or receive, permis-\nsion to go on work release. \n220 \nPrince Andrew: 2011 \np rince Andrew also fares \nimprisonment. \nThe two men are old I \nGhislaine Maxwell introduced] \ntime in the 1990s.
