Hi Jeffrey,

| saw Tom McMillen last night and he asked about you - said he lost touch. He's tight with the Obama's and is going to be
an Ambassador - apparently any country he wants. So great! I'd LOVE to be an Ambassador and am going attempt to
raise enough money on the next election cycle.

His info is: i: | hesitate to give him your info w/out ur permission...

Am doing Aspen Institute Socrates Society program over President's weekend if you're in Aspen! Miss you!
Love and Happiness, Gwendolyn
