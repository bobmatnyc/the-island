The closer it gets to running \nthe world once more, the more you are \nreminded of all the things that bugged \nyou the last time around. \nThe Clintons' neediness, their sense \nof what they are owed in material \nterms for their public service, their as-\nsumption that they're entitled to every-\none's money. \nAre we about to put the \"For Rent\" \nsign back on the Lincoln Bedroom? \nIf Americans are worried about \nmoney in politics, there is no larger \nconcern than the Clintons, who are cos-\nseted in a world where rich people end-\nlessly scratch the backs of rich people. \nThey have a Wile E. Coyote problem; \nsomething is always blowing up. Just \nwhen the Clintons are supposed to be \nfloating above it all, on a dignified cloud \nof do-gooding leading into 2016, pop-pop-\npop, little explosions go off everywhere, \nreminding us of the troubling connec-\ntions and values they drag around. \nThere's the continuing grotesque \nspectacle of Anthony Weiner and Huma \nAbedin. And there's the sketchy in-\nvolvement of the Clintons' most prolific \nfund-raiser, Terry McAuliffe, and Hil-\nlary's brother Tony Rodham in a ven-\nture, GreenTech Automotive; it's under \nfederal investigation and causing fire-\nworks in Virginia, where McAuliffe is \nrunning for governor. \nMany Israelis were disgusted to learn \nthat Bill Clinton was originally sched-\nuled to scarf up $500,000 to speak at the \nIsraeli president Shimon Peres's 90th \nbe-\ningbirthday friends \nwith PerestiwesinJune d b \n. nguesrso \ning the accord that won Peres e Nobel \ng gthe \nPeace Prize were not reasons enough \ntofoofrtdhBoenil jla ett oew chi sea 1111 ef Nba ramat n. t Toa iht the \neul am. he tlaoi dbn aragnr e ch \nfoun-\ndation. Isn't the J.N.F. \"supposed to \nplant trees with donor cash?\" Haaretz \nchided before the fund pulled back. \"l \nguess money does grow on trees.\" \nI never thought I'd have to read the \nwords Ira Magaziner again. But the \nman who helped Hillary torpedo her \nown health care plan is back. \nIn an article in this newspaper last \nweek headlined \"Unease at Clinton \nFoundation,\" Nicholas Confessore and \nAmy Chozick offered a compelling \nchronicle about an internal review of \nthe rechristened Bill, Hillary & Chelsea \nClinton Foundation that illuminated the \nfungible finances and tensions between \nClinton loyalists and the foundation ar-\nchitects Magaziner and Doug Band, \nformer bag carrier for President Clin-\nton. \nYou never hear about problems with \nJimmy Carter's foundation; he just \nquietly goes around the world eradicat-\ning Guinea worm disease. But \nMagaziner continues to be a Gyro \nGearloose, the inept inventor of Donald \nDuck's Duckburg. \n\"On one occasion, Mr. Magaziner dis-\npatched a team of employees to fly \naround the world for months gathering \nideas for a climate change proposal that \nnever got off the grouhd,\" Oonfessore \nand Chozick said. \nWe are supposed to believe that every \ndollar given to a Clinton is a dollar that \nimproves the world. But is it? Clinton-\nworld is a galaxy where personal en-\nrichment and political advancement \nblend seamlessly, and where a cast of \njarringly familiar characters pad their \npockets every which way to Sunday. \n\"Efforts to insulate the foundation \nfrom potential conflicts have high-\nlighted just how difficult it can be to dis-\nentangle the Clintons' charity work \nfrom Mr. Clinton's moneymaking ven-\ntures and Mrs. Clinton's political fu-\nture,\" Confessore and Chozick wrote. \nThe most_ evripous :seat el MOMS \nwas a firm founded by Doug sad \ncalled Teneo, a saunmy blond at cow rate consulting. public rib:loos and merchant banking. Band. a surrogate \nson to Bill. put Hume, a surrogate \ndaughter to Hillary. on the payroll. \nEven Big Daddy Bill was a paid adviset \nAs this newspaper reported,Teneo \nworked on retainer charging monthly \nfees up to $250,000 and recruiung clients \nfrom among Clinton Foundation donors. \nwhile encouraging others to become \nfoundation donors. The Clintons dis-\ntanced themselves from Teneo when \nthey got scorched \nwith had publicity \nafter the collapse of \nits client MF \nthe international \nbrokerage firm led by \nthe former New Jer: \nsey governor Jon \nCorzine. \nAnd Chelsea is now t \nshaping the founda-\ntion's future, and her \npolitical future. So \nthere may not be as much oxygen for \nher troublesome surrogate siblings. \nAs George Packer wrote in The New \nYorker, Bill Clinton earned $17 million \nlast year giving speeches, including one \nto a Lagos company for $700,000. Hil-\nlary gets $200,000 a speech. \nUntil Harry Truman wrote his mem-\noirs, the ex-president struggled on an \nArmy pension of $112.56 a month. \"1 \ncopid never letnimitelf anyctrxesac-\nuoa, howeNertaspect able,\" he4a1sli 4 \n\"that Would commercialize on the \nprestige and dignity of the office of the \npresidency.\" \nSo quaint, Packer wrote, observing, \n\"The top of American life has become a \nvery cozy and lucrative place, where the \nsocial capital of who you are and who \nyou know brings unimaginable returns.\" \nThe Clintons want to do big worthy \nthings, but they also want to squeeze \nmoney from rich people wherever they \nlive on planet Earth, insatiably gob-\nbling up cash for politics and charity \nand themselves from the same incestu-\nous swirl. \nClintonworld \nis a galaxy \nwhere \npersonal \nenrichment \nand political \nadvancement \nblend seam-\nlessly. \nSi \nSt \n51 \n01",
