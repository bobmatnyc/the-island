  "text": "Our $25 PO is based on our DCF model as we do not expect the company to be\nprofitable until mid- to late-2019 and any earnings-based valuation exercise would\nrequire discounting back future earnings. Our DCF assumes approximately $28bn\nrevenue by 2027 based on 525mn DAUs and $50+ in ARPU. Our PO implies 15.5x EV /\nRevenue, above the peer group at 4x, as we believe Snap's early stage of ad\nmonetization and potential future leverage in the business model warrants a premium\nvaluation multiple to the social media group.\n\n.
