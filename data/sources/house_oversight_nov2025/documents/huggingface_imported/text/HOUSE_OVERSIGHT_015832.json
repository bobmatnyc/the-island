If I have a number that\nrepresents the design for a building or a mathematical theorem, these\nnumbers have purpose. If I input these numbers to a computer along\nwith some building design software or a copy of Mathematica they\nwill do something interesting; allowing a construction firm to build a\ninnovative building or a mathematician to check a theorem is sound.\n\nIt’s a lot harder to prove numbers representing art are functionally\nuseful. A work of art is in some sense not complete — it still needs to go\nthrough the process of being appreciated by someone. We could show it\nto a friend or exhibit it in a gallery but this is un unpredictable process.\nVan Gogh's paintings were so criticized in his lifetime, many people\nwould have denied them the label art, and Edwin Morgan’s Loch Ness\n\nArt or Information\n\nMonster poem is almost pure gibberish, but it’s undoubtedly art. Art is\na tricky problem but, in practice, most of us agree on what constitutes\ngood and bad art. We will look again at art, in Chapter 10.\n\nClassically we assume knowledge is discovered through random\nchance and iteration. To understand how this might work let’s lay out\nthe world’s information in a way we can visualize. Imagine every piece\nof discoverable knowledge could be found in an infinitely large library.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015832",
