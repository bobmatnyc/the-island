Some\nsources have wondered why, if he was such a big producer at Bear Stearns, he would have given\nit up over a mere $2,500 fine.\n\nCertainly the years after Epstein left the firm were not obviously prosperous ones. His luck\ndidn’t seem to change until he met Hoffenberg.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017780",
