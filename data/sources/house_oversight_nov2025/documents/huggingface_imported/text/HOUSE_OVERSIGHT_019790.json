  "text": "302 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\neven though they had been isolated from any network. This innova-\ntion had provided President Obama and his national security team\nan edge of which our adversaries were unaware from 2008 to 2013.\nHowever, Snowden deliberately nullified this advantage in 2013 by\nrevealing this technology (which was published in The New York\nTimes and other newspapers). The vast number of documents that\nhe compromised contained many other secret sources and methods.\n\nThe full extent of the damage Snowden did may never be fully\nknown, even though the Department of Defense spent the better\npart of a year, and tens of thousands of investigative man-hours,\ntrying to sort out just the compromised sources and methods per-\ntaining to military and cyber-defense operations. In addition to the\ndirect and significant cost to taxpayers represented by this investiga-\ntion, one measure of how serious the loss has been was revealed by\nMichael McConnell, the vice-chairman of the company for which\nSnowden had worked at the time of the breach. McConnell stated\npublicly, “Snowden has compromised more capability than any spy\nin U.S. history.” McConnell had no obvious reason to exaggerate the\n\n® loss because his company, Booz Allen Hamilton, was partly respon- ©\nsible for the damage. It hired Snowden, as will be recalled, even after\nits vetters had detected an untruthful statement in his application.\nMcConnell said, “This will have impact on our ability to do our\nmission for the next twenty to thirty years.” By any measure, two\ndecades of lost intelligence is a steep price to pay.\n\nTo be sure, the practical value of peacetime intelligence about\nthe activities of adversary states is not always evident. What is far\nclearer to the public is the value of intelligence that can thwart ter-\nrorist attacks against subways, theaters, and other civilian targets.\nWe have seen that Snowden also deprived the NSA of much of the\neffectiveness of its PRISM program by revealing it, through the arti-\ncles published at his specific behest in The Guardian and The Wash-\nington Post that explained how it worked. This single revelation\ncompromised a system, duly authorized by Congress and the presi-\ndent, that had been the government’s single most effective tool for\nlearning in advance about attacks in America and Europe by jihadist\nterrorists.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 302 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019790",
