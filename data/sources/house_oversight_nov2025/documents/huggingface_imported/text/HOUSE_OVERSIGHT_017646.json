Rev. 861, *876\n\nhistory even once in a twenty-page subcommittee report, in four pages of minutes of its discussions, or in twenty-six pages of\nproposed amendments and accompanying Advisory Committee Notes. °° Perhaps the Advisory Committee took a different\napproach than the CVRA's drafters because it did not consider their stated intentions.\n\nIf, on the other hand, the Advisory Committee was aware of the drafters’ intentions and declined to follow them, it is staking\nout a rather unusual path. It is standard practice for the Advisory Committee, no less than courts, to look to legislative history in\ncrafting the Rules. 8? With respect to the CVRA in particular, many courts have found the CVRA's legislative history highly\ninstructive. They have good reason for relying on the history. Unlike some contentious pieces of legislation where legislators\npossessed divergent views, the CVRA enjoyed a \"broad, bi-partisan consensus.\" *° It passed by a vote of 393 to 14 in the\nHouse °! and by a voice vote in the Senate. ?? Moreover, the CVRA's cosponsors were bipartisan, and the views they gave on\nthe legislation were not contradicted by anyone else. Thus, as the Ninth Circuit has explained in construing the CVRA to track\nSenator Kyl's and Feinstein's views:\n\nFloor statements by the sponsors of the legislation are given considerably more weight than floor statements by other members,\nand they are given even more weight where, as here, other legislators did not offer any contrary views. Silence, the maxim\ngoes, connotes assent, and so we can draw from the fact that no one registered disagreement with Senators Kyl and Feinstein on\nthis point the reasonable inference that the views they expressed reflected a consensus, at least in the Senate. 7?\n\nIn light of all this, it is beyond doubt that crime victims have a substantive right to be treated with fairness (as well as with\nrespect for their dignity and [*877] privacy) in the federal criminal justice process. Once that right is in mind, the Advisory\nCommittee has clear duties under the Rules Enabling Act. That Act provides that the Rules \"shall not abridge, enlarge or\nmodify any substantive right.\" °4 Therefore, if any existing rule of criminal procedure \"abridges\" or even \"modifies\" a victim's\nrights to fairness, it is invalid and must be changed. Accordingly, the Advisory Committee must review all the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure to ensure that they protect victims’ right to fairness.\n\nB. The Advisory Committee Treats the Right to Fairness Inconsistently\n\nThe Advisory Committee claimed that to implement the right to fairness would use the right as \"a springboard for a variety of\nvictim rights not otherwise provided for in the CVRA.\" * If so, the Advisory Committee was unable to consistently follow its\nown view. The Advisory Committee agreed with my proposed change to Rule 18; that change required that when a court\ndetermines where within a judicial district to hold a trial, it should consider not only the convenience of the defendant and the\n\n88 See Advisory Committee Report, supra note 69, at 1-20; Advisory Committee Minutes, supra note 68, at 13-16; Proposed Amendments,\nsupra note 71, at 349-75.\n\n8 See, e.g., Fed R.
