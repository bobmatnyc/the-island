  "text": "During the exercise, Meir said nothing at all. I couldn’t help wondering\nwhether, despite our nearly daily exercises, and my nightly stock-taking, I'd\nsomehow missed an obvious detail in our planning. When we got back to the\nsayeret base, Avraham was waiting for us. “Well?” he asked Meir. “They don’t\nneed me,” he said. “They know what they’re doing.” It was not just a source of\nreassurance for me, but a huge relief for Avraham.\n\nThe team I’d inherited from Tubul included three gifted soldiers with\ndifferent backgrounds, and different skills. Motti Nagar was born in Cairo. He\nwas short but solidly built, smart, level-headed and almost always smiling. Kuti\nSharabi grew up in a Yemeni family in an impoverished neighborhood in Tel\nAviv. He had a self-deprecating sense of humor, a quick mind and sometimes\neven quicker tongue, but an extraordinary ability to focus on the task at hand.\nThe third member was a kibbutznik. His name was Moshe Elimelech. We called\nhim Moshiko. Utterly self-contained, a man who spoke only when absolutely\nnecessary, he also brought two different qualities to the mission. One was going\nto be indispensable: an almost squirrel-like ability to climb trees. Or telephone\npoles. The other, of which I was a bit more leery, was a total, deeply irrational,\nabsence of fear.\n\nThough none of us needed a further reminder of the weight being attached to\nour mission, the night before we headed north, Avraham got a call from the\nchief-of- staff's office. Tzvi Tzur wanted to see me the next morning for a\npersonal briefing. I tried to get Avraham to say no. I pointed out that if we\ndidn’t get going by ten o’clock at the latest, we’d risk throwing everything off\nschedule. But “no” was not an option. After some further back-and-forth, it was\nagreed that I would meet the commander of Israel’s armed forces at nine the\nnext morning at a gas station north of Tel Aviv and join him for the 20-minute\ndrive along the coastal road to a speaking engagement he had in Netanya.\n\nI saw Avraham again before I set off. “We are beginning an extremely\ncritical 24 hours for our unit, the intelligence corps, in fact for the armed forces\nas a whole,” he told me. “I don’t know what might happen. No one does. Just\nremember two things. First, out there, in the field, you are the ramatkal” — the\nchief of staff. He told me that only I and my team could judge and respond to\nwhat we encountered once the operation started. “And second, this mission has\nto be accomplished.”\n\nI left see the real ramatkal. Before we began the drive to Netanya, he asked\nme to unfold the map I'd brought with me and talk him through, step by step,\nhow we planned to get onto the Golan, plant the bugging device, and get back\n\n66\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027914",
