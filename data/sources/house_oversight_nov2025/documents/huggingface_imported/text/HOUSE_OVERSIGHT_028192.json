  "text": "/ BARAK / 58\n\nprevious Israeli leader in trying to get that peace.\n\nI knew that he would press me to tell him how far that actually was. He didn’t\nask directly. But each of his ostensibly theoretical questions was aimed at\nestablishing whether I could give him enough for a summit to bridge the gaps on\nkey issues. Could I accept a “trade-off between sovereignty and time?”\nTranslation: could I give the Palestinians sovereignty over a larger part of the West\nBank if we signed an agreement that would phase in their control? Could I accept\nthe principle of land swaps? This meant giving Arafat land in areas bordering the\nWest Bank, or in the Negev near Gaza, to compensate, at least partially, for the\narea we would keep for the major settlement blocs. What about applying my\nprinciple of “disengagement” between Israel and the Palestinians to Jerusalem?\nMeaning Arafat getting control of the predominantly Arab neighborhoods in the\neast of the city.\n\nDennis knew my long-standing reluctance to commit to concessions until we\ngot to real, final negotiations with Arafat. “We’ll not reveal anything you tell us,”\nhe assured me. “We won’t turn what you say into opening negotiating positions for\nArafat. But if there is going to be a summit, the President wanted some answers.”\nTo Dennis’s frustration, however, I could give him no specifics, beyond telling\nhim: “You know me, Dennis. You know I’m serious about this. Of course, we will\nprotect our vital security and national interests. But the problem in making peace\nwon’t be us, on the Israeli side, as long as Arafat shows a capacity and a will for\ndecision.” The translation of that, as I hoped and trusted he understood was that if\nand when Arafat demonstrated that he wanted a comprehensive peace between a\nnew Palestinian state and the State of Israel — a definitive “end of conflict” as the\ninternational lawyers would describe it — I would place nothing, except our security\nand core national interests, in the way of getting an agreement.\n\nMadeleine Albright visited at the end of June. When she came to see me a day\nafter meeting Arafat, she carried a request from the Palestinian leader: two weeks\nof “preparatory” talks before a summit. Again, I knew her mission was to bring\nback enough progress for the President to feel a summit was worth it. But again, I\ncouldn’t give her what she wanted. “I know what will happen in preparatory talks,”\nI said. “We’ll raise new ideas, which the Palestinians will reject, and ask for\nmore.” I don’t know what she told Clinton, or Arafat. But Dennis called me the\nfollowing day. He said that Arafat had agreed to attend a summit, and would leave\nthe date up to the President.\n\n344\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028192",
