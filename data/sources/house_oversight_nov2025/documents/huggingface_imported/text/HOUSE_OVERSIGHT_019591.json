But China had the final\nsay in any extradition decision. In fact, China had explicitly been\ngiven the right of vetoing any extraditions for any reason in the\nformal 1999 agreement between Hong Kong and the United States.\nBecause the Chinese president, Xi Jinping, had just met with Presi-\ndent Obama in California, China also had an interest in avoiding\nembarrassing public demonstrations on behalf of Snowden. Accord-\ning to a well-placed official in Hong Kong, China’s liaison office in\nHong Kong told the Hong Kong Authority in no uncertain terms\nthat Snowden had to be out of Hong Kong by June 23.\n\nOn June 19, Snowden had a meeting with Tibbo, the barrister who\nwould handle any eventual court case, and Man and Ho, the Hong\nKong solicitors who had been retained for him. It took place in a\nsmall apartment where, according to Ho, they ate pizza while they\ndiscussed Snowden’s options.\n\nTibbo wanted Snowden to remain in Hong Kong, allow himself\n\n© to be arrested, seek bail, and fight extradition in court.

Soon after-\nward, Snowden would be temporarily jailed, and his computers,\nelectronic gear, and thumb drives would be seized and placed in the\ncustody of the court. Tibbo would immediately seek his release on\nbail but could not guarantee an outcome because Snowden, who\nhad fled U.S. jurisdiction, might be considered a flight risk. If so,\nSnowden could remain incarcerated during the long court battle.\nDuring the litigation, Snowden would have a platform to make\nhis case against U.S. surveillance. Indeed, Tibbo’s strategy involved\nbuilding massive public support for Snowden’s cause. Once the U.S.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 103 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019591",
