  "text": "There is no question that the shift to value-based reimbursement models will have a major\nimpact on the economics of healthcare. Payers will be looking for ways to significantly reduce\ncosts in all areas where a range of viable lower cost solutions are available, and will force\nproviders to use those wherever possible through increasingly restrictive reimbursement\npolicies. As an example, one area where this type of change has been implemented successfully\nfor years is in the increased use of generic drugs, where payers no longer offer unrestricted\nreimbursement for the use of high cost, premium priced branded biopharmaceutical products\nthat deliver only minor benefits in terms of convenience, or slight improvements in efficacy to\nsmall percentages of patients. This type of value-based review is now going on in all areas\nwithin healthcare, and is resulting in changes that are having a major impact on what services\nand products are selected, and who bears what percentage of the cost of that selection.\n\nAt the same time that payers and other ‘at-risk’ organizations are looking for any and all\nopportunities to move to lower cost alternatives, they are also continuing to invest in the\nadoption of innovative new therapeutics which can both improve outcomes and deliver\nquantifiable value, even when considering their additional costs and premium pricing. The\nproducts that receive this type of support from payers are ones that are focused on addressing\ntruly unmet medical needs and deliver significant efficacy or safety benefits to patients, when\ncompared to existing standards of care. They are also usually based on new technologies that\nenable novel approaches to the treatment of diseases and disorders. There are vast areas in\nmedicine where large unmet medical needs exist and where scientific and technological\nprogress is enabling entirely new approaches to addressing these. Where these intersect are\nareas of great opportunity for experienced investors.\n\nRAPID ACCELERATION IN INNOVATION IN TARGETED SECTORS\n\nBiopharmaceuticals:\n\nDecades of government and industry investment in the study of the biological and genetic basis\nof disease is translating into a steady stream of new products with improved efficacy and\ndecreased toxicity, and these are transforming how many high-morbidity diseases can be\ntreated. Through this growing body of work, a much deeper understanding of the biochemical\npathways underlying complex diseases is emerging, which is leading to identification of many\nnew molecular targets for drug therapy. This targeted approach to pharmaceutical R&D is a\nfundamental change from the historical process that relied on large-scale, random screening of\ndrug candidates for activity. A whole new generation of products targeting diseases at the\nmolecular level is emerging and these offer much higher levels of efficacy and improved safety\nto specific groups of patients whose disease is well characterized by biomarkers that are tightly\nlinked to the mechanisms of the underlying disease. This more targeted approach to discovery\nand development offers important benefits to all constituents, which ultimately improves the\ninvestment environment in biopharmaceuticals.\n\nOncology (i.e., cancer) is one therapeutic area where some of the most significant progress has\nbeen made recently. Targeted therapies in certain indications in oncology now provide for\nmore effective treatments with fewer side effects than one-size-fits-all chemotherapy drugs. For\nexample, new therapies have recently been developed that target specific subsets of malignancy\nthrough molecular targets including EGFR, HER2, and BRAF that have led to dramatic\nimprovement in the treatment of certain cancers (e.g., lung, pancreatic, colon, breast, melanoma,\nand several hematologic cancers). It is expected that the next wave of advances will transform\n\n27 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024038",
