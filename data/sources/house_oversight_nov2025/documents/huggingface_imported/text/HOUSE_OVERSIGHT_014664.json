Dercurtremt DIGI Filed Oe\"\n\nTroubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorra ranch in New Mexico in 2001\n\nVirginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a\nteacher before becoming a Wail Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political,\nfinancial and academic establishment.\n\nAs a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.\nHe guaranteed her a minimum of $200 each time she gave him what he called an ‘erotic massage.’\n\nVirginia said: ‘I would always receive the money immediately. He would give me the cash from a wad\nhe carried in a black duffel bag or an assistant paid me.\n\n‘And, because of the way Epstein had warped her sensibilities, every time she took the cash,\nVirginia felt even more indebted to him. Secretly, he was also preparing her for an even more\ndisturbing role.\n\n‘Basically, | was training to bea prostitute for him\nand his friends who shared his interest in young\n\nEpstein had trained me\nirls,’ sh : ‘After about two , he started\nBaek mets antartain his friends. estene to do whatever men\n\nIt started when Epstein called Virginia at the Pam Wanted. | told myself |\nBeach apartment he had rented for her. r\nwas special\n\nShe recalls: ‘He said, “I've got a good friend and |\nneed you to fly to the island to\nentertain him, massage him and make him fee! how you make me feel.”\n\nHe didn’t spell out what | had to do. He didn’t have to. ‘He'd trained me to do whatever a man\nwanted. | was shocked but | told myself he was sharing me around because he trusted me and | was\nspecial.\n\n| was worried, but | would do anything to keep Jeffrey happy and to keep my place as his number\none girl.\n\nHe would keep telling me how lucky | was with the life | was leading and the money ! was making. It\nwas easy to fall into his grasp.\n\n‘The way it usually worked was I’d be sent to meet a man on the private island Jeffrey owned in the\nCaribbean, or at his ranch in New Mexico, which was really isolated.’ She was ‘given’ to men ranging\nin age from their 40s to their 60s.\n\nThey included a well-known businessman (whose pregnant wife was asleep in the next room), a\nworld-renowned scientist, a respected liberal politician and a foreign head of state.\n\nNone appeared to think the arrangement was unusual. Virginia says there were many other girls in\nEpstein’s circle and that she was paid extra money to help recruit them.\n\n‘They would lounge around the Palm Beach house, the ranch or the island, nude or topless,’ she\nsays. ‘But | was one of the very few he trusted as “special” and chosen to “entertain” his friends.’\n\nVirginia took the sedative Xanax to detach herself from sordid reality. ‘lt was an escape drug,’ she\nsays. ‘It made me caim and helped me forget about what | had to do. | was up to eight pills a day.’\n\nEpstein had no objection to Virginia's use of prescription drugs, no doubt recognising that they made\nher even more malleable. ‘I didn’t want to go back to the life I'd had before’ she says.\n\n‘That made me totally obedient.’ Despite the fact that Epstein was, essentially, her pimp, this life now\nseemed normal to Virginia. ‘l felt that he and Ghislaine really cared for me,’ she said.\n\n‘We'd do family things, like watch Sex And The City and eat popcorn. ‘A lot of it was very glamorous.\n| met famous friends of his such as Al Gore and Heidi Klum and Naomi Campbell. He introduced me\nas his “travelling masseuse.”\n\nSome people mistook me for his daughter. ‘When we were in New York or Palm Beach, Ghislaine\nand | would shop all day.\n\nhitp:/Avww.dailymail.co.uk/news/article- 1361039/Prince-Andreaw-girl-17-sex-offender-friend-flaw-Britain-meet-him.htm!\n\nSi PaIPgoGret 9\n\nas she leaves her\nblouse undone across\nher chest during NYC\nouting with her children\nMom-offour\n\ne’s almost as tall as\nher mom!
