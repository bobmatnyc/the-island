As reviewed above, this has turned out to be\nthe case in several studies of the EEG and electrocorticogram in epileptic patients.\nFuther research will be required to see if this idea has substance more generally for\n\npredicting “catastrophic” changes in other brain-related systems.\n\nPower Law Scaling of Orbital Geometries in Time Series Reconstructions\n\nBenoit Mandelbrot’s book in its first incarnation was derived from his lectures\nat College de France in 1973 and 1974 and was called Les Objets Fractals: Forme,\nHasard et Dimension (Mandelbrot, 1975). This essay was translated into English as\nFractals, Form Chance and Dimension (Mandelbrot, 1977). Later expanded and\nreworked editions displayed another title, The Fractal Geometry of Nature\n(Mandelbrot, 1982) but the deep conceptual, sometimes poetic fusion and confusion\ngenerated by the apparent identity among the objects of his first title remains.\n“Fractal,” along with “chaos” and “strange attractor” are among the most widely\nfamiliar new words in modern dynamical systems research. Fractal is the most\ndifficult to rigorously define and is commonly misunderstood due to the evocative\nyet dream-like cognitive condensations provoked by the first title and its reflections\nin Mandelbrot’s prose. A common conceptual confusion is exemplified by the\nassumed relation between “fractal time event distributions” of the cardiac interbeat\ninterval and the “fractal like” anatomy of the purkinje network of the cardiac\nconduction system. Data from both contexts are often shown juxtaposed in the\nsame illustration as though their relationships were obvious (Goldberger et al, 1990;\nGoldberger, 1996; Liebovitch and Todorov, 1996). “Fractal times” and “fractal\n\n224\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013724",
