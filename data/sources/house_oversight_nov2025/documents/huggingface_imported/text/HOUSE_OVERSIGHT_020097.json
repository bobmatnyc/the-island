I don’t see a plan for getting through.\nNow, I gave him a plan, I said you seal the Oval Office, you send those two kids home,\nyou get rid of Hope, all these deadbeats, and you listen to your legal team—Kasowitz, and\nMark Dowd, and Jay Sekulow, and Mark Corallo, these are all professionals who have\ndone this many times. You listen to those guys and never talk about this stuff again, you\njust conduct yourself as commander in chief and then you can be president for eight years.\nIf you don’t, you’re not, simple. But he’s the president, he gets a choice, and he’s clearly\nchoosing to go down another path ... and you can’t stop him. The guy is going to call his\nown plays. He’s Trump... .”\n\nAnd then another call came, this one from Sam Nunberg. He, too, was calling about\nScaramucci, and his words caused something like stupefaction in Bannon: “No fucking,\nfucking way.”\n\nBannon got off the phone and said, “Jesus. Scaramucci. I can’t even respond to this.\nIt’s Kafkaesque. Jared and Ivanka needed somebody to represent their shit. It’s madness.\nHe’ll be on that podium for two days and he’ll be so chopped he’ll bleed out everywhere.\nHe'll literally blow up in a week. This is why I don’t take this stuff seriously. Hiring\nScaramucci? He’s not qualified to do anything. He runs a fund of funds. Do you know\nwhat a fund of funds 1s? It’s not a fund. Dude, it’s sick. We look like buffoons.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nThe ten days of Anthony Scaramucci, saw, on the first day, July 21, the resignation of\nSean Spicer. Oddly, this seemed to catch everyone unawares. In a meeting with\nScaramucci, Spicer, and Priebus, the president—who in his announcement of\nScaramucci’s hire as communications director had promoted Scaramucci not only over\nSpicer, but in effect over Priebus, his chief of staff—suggested that the men ought to be\nable to work it out together.\n\nSpicer went back to his office, printed out his letter of resignation, and then took it\nback to the nonplussed president, who said again that he really wanted Spicer to be a part\nof things. But Spicer, surely the most mocked man in America, understood that he had\nbeen handed a gift. His White House days were over.\n\nFor Scaramucci, it was now payback time. Scaramucci blamed his six humiliating\nmonths out in the cold on nobody so much as Reince Priebus—having announced his\nWhite House future, having sold his business in anticipation of it, he had come away with\nnothing, or at least nothing of any value. But now, in a reversal befitting a true master of\nthe universe—befitting, actually, Trump himself—Scaramucci was in the White House,\nbigger, better, and grander than even he had had the gall to imagine. And Priebus was dead\nmeat.\n\nThat was the signal the president had sent Scaramucci—deal with the mess. In Trump’s\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020097",
