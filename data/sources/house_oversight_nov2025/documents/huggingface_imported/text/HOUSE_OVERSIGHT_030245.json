  "text": "From: Jeffrey E. [jeevacation@gma il.com] \nSent: 7/17/2016 1:35:22 PM \nTo: Jeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: the story \nImportance: High \n1. all the girls discussed in the press , came to the house , to give erotic massages. each and every girl , each \ntime, came in exchange for money. many of the girls interviewed were in their mid twenties early thirties, no \nsearching for underage girls. many of the girls worked in the local massage parlors. ( advertised everyday in \nthe palm beach papers. , referred in the local vernacular to \" jack shacks\". 5 within 4 miles of the intl airpot. \n) or strip clubs.. ( both of the girls bringing the cvra case ). \n2. There have been discussios of a house full of underage photos. the video taken by the police contradict that \nin its entirety \n3 there have been discsussion about hidden video cameras, they were put there with the HELP of the local \nPolice , in order to catch a thief money had been going missing , and the police cam , set up cameras, and \none night hid in the bushes hoping to catch the thief in the act. It turned out to be the houseman. who \nconfessed, . there were never any hidden cameras anywhere besides the garage and the camera in the living \nroom focused on the place where money was kept \n4. The police conducted a search, and found adult sextoys, I am an adult, they made a point to say that there \nwas a purple plastic sex toy„ but later without correcting their earliler assertion disconver it was nothing but a \nsalad fork \n5. The girl whose parents initiated the investigation, told the police in a sworn statment that she had lied about \nher age to gain access to the house. she said she tried her best to appear over 18 , as she wanted to be invited \nback, there was not trolling for anyone underage. \n6. many if not most of the girls , invited their friends , best friends after they had left. hardly a normal result \nif there had been any coercion or anytrhing untoward. \n7, many of the girls had their boyfirends wait downstairs, or in some instances their parents. not one \ntime did anyone ever complain of mistreatment , \n8 there was never ever any drugs , alcolhol, threats, coercion \n9 the local sex crimes prosecutor, lana belahovilc , interviewed the girls herself , and concluded in her own \nwords dire wer no real victims here. just local prostituion. she offer a 5 year probation sentence with no \nregistration. . Alan dershowitwz told me I shouldnt take it. it was too dangerous. not telling me that my \nprobation would have been moved to my home in the virigin islands. then the prosecutors to be \nfair presented their information to a grand jury, the ONLY time a jury would see any of the claims, the result \nwas a charge of soliction of prostituion . a crime with a mandatory release after taking a harms of prostiution \ncourse. This was a grand jury determination. \n10. local. no transportation across state lines, contrary to outragious and hbeious \nallegations, no trafficking. it is a disservice to women who are trafficked to compare a woman brought into \nthe country , tied to a bed, given drugs to have sex with strangers for money that she doesnt get. . to girsl who \ntook a taxi to my house, had food snacks and got paid, then went shopping with her friedns and back home. \n11/ the fbi decided to pursue a highly unusual case. their position was that my secretary , not ire, called girls \non the telephone and asked them if they would like to work. . many times as the message pads reveall the \ngirls called over and over again askking to work, hardly coercion ( the latest \ncases REQURE coercion, which states it is NOT for making appts ....... \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 030245 \n12 THe fbi, threatend many statutes if i would not plead guilty to a state crime, they suggested that a cell \nphone was a means of interstae commerce ( similar to perverts who troll the intern& , in searhc of underage \ngirsl , and in each and every one of those cases the govt is required to confirm , and they do,that the person \nKNEW or that the person on the other end of the computer was underage. . all stings hve the police stinger ask \ndont you know that i am 14, 13 etc. there was never any such conversation with anyone. \n13. the govt said that traveling to my homeof 15 year in florida, ccould be considered traveling for thepurpsoe \nof underage sex. never before anyone not crossing state lines with a person , charged with a crimge for going \nhome \n14. the gov said that they would not bring an indictment if i plead guilty to being a pimp.( a crime in florida \nthat REQUIRES the pimpt to earh money off the the girls , ( regster as a sex offender ) and pay a list of girls \nwhose names they would provide me only AF l'ER the fact. and AF l'ER i was in jail. I would have to agree \nNOT to contest any claim by anyone they put on the list . when I attempted to do so , as i never met some of \nthe people on the list. I reived a letter stating that any attempt to question their story would result in a breech of \nmy agreeernnt. \n15. If I had tto do it over I hope i would have shown much better judgement as many of the girls came from \nunderprivleged familys and i was unaware of the potential for halm. \n16. , has said she was a sex slave. . she has now admited she lied about her age. she was \nnever 15. she has changed th story on my wikipieia page , but no press statment. she said that clinton was on \nthe island, not true, she said ghilsane flew him in a black helipcopter, I did not have a black heli and she \nnever flew him, she said that al gore and wife were on the isalnd never happened, she has accused a prime \nminisnter a senator a prinve. a sceintist, alan dershowitz. a many in his seventies with his wife in \nattendance. sex on a plane with secret service and dimplanic protection people looking the other way. . she \nhad an arrest warmat for her as she stole money from the restaurnat at which she worked, she had before made \nclainds of sexual assualts but the prosecutro said she had no creidbility , 1 emiails , suggst \nadding alan dershowitz to her complaint. emails suggest•might have comminted pergury \n. she has said that the house had many photos of underage girls , a recent press realease clearly shows \nanother lie. \n17, the press has labled me a pedophile a disgusting term for men atracted to pre pubcesnet girsl. . these \ngirls worked in a strip club. .
