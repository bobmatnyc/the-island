Why do I\nthink this?\n\nBecause it makes it clear that she hasn’t a clue, and doesn’t really\ncare, about causation.\n\nAnd, this is exactly the problem with Sarah Palin’s remarks to\nKatie Couric as well:\n\nCouric: .. . people have questioned your readiness since that\ninterview. And I’m curious to hear your reaction.\n\nPalin: Well, not only am I ready but willing and able to serve as\nvice president with Senator McCain if Americans so bless us\nand privilege us with the opportunity of serving them, ready\nwith my executive experience as a city mayor and manager,\nas a governor, as a commissioner, a regulator of oil and gas,\nnot only with my résumé proving that readiness, but I think\nthe important thing here is that John McCain and I, we share\na vision for America that includes energy independence.\n\nWhy do I think that the problem here is about a misunderstanding of\nhow to determine causation?

Not only could one argue with each of\nthese propositions, but it is fair to say that Miss South Carolina herself\ndoesn’t know that she holds these positions, that she hasn’t thought\nabout them, and that she might disagree with what she said if some-\none pointed this out to her.\n\nIn other words, she cannot reason well precisely because her be-\nliefs indicate that she does not think about causation, and one can\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023896",
