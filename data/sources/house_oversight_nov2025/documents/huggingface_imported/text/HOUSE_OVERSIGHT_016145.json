  "text": "useful and relevant pricing benchmark in this regard, in our view. The Qatar 10-year\nsovereign bond currently trades at yields of 3.0%. However, Saudi CDS has been trading\nc65bps wider of Qatari CDS, which would suggest a 10-year Saudi bond yield of c3.65%.\nCurrent CDS spread levels suggest potential for some notch downgrades from Saudi\nArabia’s current rating, as the market prices in issuance risk, volatile oil prices, hedging\n\nflows relative to the USD peg and the banking sector off-balance sheet wrong-way\nexposure risk.\n\nSaudi forwards, rates and CDS remain under pressure\n\nDomestic rates are under pressure with the 5y IRS spread over US at historically\nelevated levels due to structurally tighter liquidity. Budget consolidation could help take\nsome of the pressure off as it would imply lower debt issuance needs. However, it would\nalso imply lower deposit formation in domestic banks as fiscal retrenchment will impact\nprivate sector economic activity. Greater risk premium, issuance pressures and tighter\nliquidity will also keep CDS spreads elevated until oil recovers.\n\nHedging against SAR devaluation risks remains strategically attractive given the risk-\nreward ratio. Data suggest a strained backdrop for external and domestic liquidity\nreflecting the combination of private sector dollarization, possible capital outflows,\nweakening deposit formation and the move higher in interbank rates. However, SAMA\nhas already intervened through macro-prudential tools and may do so again if needed.\n\nChart 32: Market remains nervous on Saudi Arabia Chart 33: A pronounced increase in SAR swap spreads vs USD\n\n3 ———= Implied appreciation in 1-yr SAR fwd (%) r 160 e 7 (rhs) DB.\nBi ae ——_ yr swap\n——— Oil prices (US$/bbl, rhs) L 449 USD Syr ewap\n120 5 200\n100 4\n80 150\n60 .\n100\n40 2\n20 : 50\n0\nSes sqessSsesSsBsSsssBereIere2ee\neee ete ses ebeeesee cece wead 0 0\nSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSESSS Jan-02  Jan-04 Jan-06 Jan-08 Jan-10 Jan-12 Jan-14 Jan-16\n\nSource: Bloomberg BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.
