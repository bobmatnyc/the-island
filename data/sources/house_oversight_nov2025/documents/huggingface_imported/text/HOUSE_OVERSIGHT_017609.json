Through\nthe CVRA, Congress intended to make victims \"independent participants\" in the criminal justice process. *7 The CVRA\nextends to crime victims a series of \"rights\" in the criminal justice process - rights that the victims have [*67] independent\nstanding to assert. *4 Congress viewed these provisions as establishing a victim's right \"to participate in the process where the\ninformation that [victims] and their families can provide may be material and relevant ... .\"_ 3°\n\nCongress appears to have had both intrinsic and instrumental reasons for wanting crime victim participation. Congress clearly\nthought that such participation was valuable in its own right. Senator Kyl embodied this belief and explained his decision to\nbecome involved in the crime victims’ rights movement because of his discovery that victims:\n\nwere suffering through the trauma of the victimization and then being thrown into a system which they did not understand,\nwhich nobody was helping them with, and which literally prevented them from participation in any meaningful way. I came to\nrealize there were literally millions of people out there being denied these basic rights ... . 3°\n\nBut Congress also thought crime victim participation in the criminal justice system could be instrumentally useful. For\nexample, in protecting a victim's right to be heard by those determining a defendant's sentence, a victim might be able to\nprovide important information that could alter that sentence. As a result, the sentence might reflect a fuller appreciation of the\ndanger posed by a defendant, and the judge might take appropriate steps to prevent others from being victimized. 37\n\nCongress also intended to ensure that crime victims were not revictimized in the criminal justice process - that is, that they\nwould not suffer what scholars have called \"secondary harm\" in the process. 38 The concern is that victims suffer when they\nare excluded from the criminal justice process. Congress sought to end that suffering by making victims meaningful\n\nparticipants in criminal cases. 3°\n\nC. AN ILLUSTRATION OF THE PRE-CHARGING ISSUE: THE JEFFREY EPSTEIN CASE\n\nGrven the potentially expansive scope of victims' rights under both state provisions and the CVRA, a critical question arises\nabout how to apply them: Do the rights come into existence only after prosecutors formally file [*68] criminal charges? Or do\nthey attach at some earlier point in the process? Does v. United States, a federal case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern\nDistrict of Florida, usefully illustrates the issue. *° In that case, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of Florida\n\n22 Td.\n33 Td. at 7302 (statement of Sen. Jon Kyl).\n\n34 Compare /8 U.S.C. § 3771(d), with Susan Bandes, Victim Standing, /999 Utah L. Rev. 331, 344-45 (illustrating the debate surrounding\nvictim standing prior to adoption of the CVRA).\n\n35 150 Cong. Rec. 7296 (statement of Sen. Dianne Feinstein).\n36 Td. at 7298 (statement of Sen. Jon Kyl).\n37 Td.\n\n38 See, e.g., Douglas Evan Beloof, The Third Model of Criminal Process: The Victim Participation Model, 1999 Utah L. Rev. 289, 294-96;\nRichard A. Bierschbach, Allocution and the Purposes of Victim Participation Under the CVRA, 19 Fed. Sent'g Rep. 44, 46 (2006).\n\n39 150 Cong. Rec. 7298 (statement of Sen. Jon Kyl).\n\n40 Does v. United States, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337 (S.D. Fla. 2011). In the interest of full disclosure, two of the authors of this Article (Cassell\nand Edwards) are co-counsel for the victims in this case. The statement of the facts in this Article draws heavily on the victims' allegations as\nthey have detailed in their pending motion for summary judgment in the case. See Jane Doe #1 & Jane Doe #2's Motion for Finding of\nViolations of the Crime Victims’ Rights Act and Request for a Hearing on Appropriate Remedies at 3-23, Does, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337 (No.\n9:08-cv-80736-KAM) [hereinafter Jane Doe Motion] (providing fifty-three proposed facts in the case). The U.S. Attorney's Office has\ngenerally disputed some of these allegations without offering specifics as to what happened. See, e.g., United States' Response to Jane Doe #1\n& Jane Doe #2's Motion for Finding of Violations of the Crime Victim Rights Act and Request for a Hearing on Appropriate Remedies at 34-\n43, Does, 817 F. Supp. 2d 1337 (No. 9:08-cv-80736-KAM) [hereinafter United States' Response]. As of this writing, Epstein has declined to\nintervene in the case to dispute the allegations.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017609",
