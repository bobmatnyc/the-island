At his deposition, he took the Fifth as to\neveryone he was asked about; isn't that true?\n\nA. I haven't looked at the depositions lately.\nThere were also variations in tactics that he used. I\nrecall for example, that sometimes when he was asked\nabout a person, even if he knew that person, he would\npretend not to know that person and try to communicate\nthat, you know, maybe he didn't know that person.\n\nBut he did he did have broad invocations of\nthe Fifth Amendment in his deposition. I certainly\nwouldn't quarrel with you on that.\n\nQ. And you understand or I believe this was in\nyour testimony that if a person takes the Fifth in\nresponse to a question in a civil litigation, that\n\nanswer can be used against the person generally; is that\n\nright?\nA. Sure. Right.\nQ. Are you aware of any authority whatsoever\n\nthat Person A taking the Fifth can be used as evidence\nagainst Person B?\n\nA. Yeah, we are sitting here in the -- let's\nsee, we are in Florida, in the 11th Circuit, and that\nis -- there's 11th circuit case law that allows that to\n\nhappen.
