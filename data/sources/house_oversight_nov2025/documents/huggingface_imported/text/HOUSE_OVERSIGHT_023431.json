David g was there for Herbie and not for Clinton. I can see\nthe difference .the pilot was made for 100, 000 , with savings on the Clinton but it does show\n\nSent from my iPhone\n\nOn Sep 23, 2014, at 7:57 PM, \"jeffrey E.\" <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\n\nclinton woody kagan , do not add one penny to budget\n\nOn Tue, Sep 23, 2014 at 6:17 PM, Lisa New <M > wrote:\nThat was fun- definitely the highlight of a day that was not without other interesting moments\n\nDon't know which was better-- the wholly unexpected surprise reminder (by a prime minister) of my\nboyfriend from 1976( who was in high school, who lived with his doting parents), or , getting creamed on my\nproducer's budget but then offered the opportunity to profess poetry for production funds .
