  "text": "Questions I Want To Ask Entitled Cis Het Men, Part 1: Who Cares?\nWhy do I care about masculinity?\n\nI'm rather perverted, but not enormously queer. I present as femme, and -- although I've\nbeen known to tease my sensitive (frequently long-haired) lovers for being\n\"unmasculine\" -- I fall in love with men. I'm hardly one to go for the \"manly man\" type,\nbut at heart, I love knowing that I'm fucking a man.\n\nHowever, because I'm cisgendered and straight, I feel profoundly at a loss when trying to\narticulate problems of (for lack of a better phrase) \"Men's Empowerment.\" The issues\ndon't feel \"native\" to me; I've intersected with these questions mainly through the lens of\nlovers and friends. Watching their struggle is demoralizing, but trying to imagine how I\ncan give them feedback is more demoralizing.\n\nA male friend once wrote to me, \"I think you personally find expressions of\nmasculinity hot, but you also have no patience with sexism. You've caught on that it's\ntricky for men to figure out how to deliver both of these things you need, that you don't\nhave a lot of good direction to give to fellas about it, and that neither does anyone else.\"\n\nSo:\nHow can men be supportive and non-oppressive while remaining overtly masculine?\n\nOn top of my limited perspective, there's been an echoing lack of discourse -- that is, very\nlittle mainstream acknowledgement of the problems of masculinity. The primary factor in\nthat silence is that normative cis men themselves tend to be flatly unwilling to discuss\ngender/sex issues. Often, their first objection is that the discussion is neither important\nnor relevant. This is true even within subcultures centered around sexual analysis, like the\nBDSM world -- I once met a cis male BDSMer who said, \"Why bother talking about\nmale sexuality? It's the norm. Fish don't have a word for water.”\n\nBut if masculine sexuality is water and we're fish, why doesn't that motivate us to\nexamine it more -- not less?\n\nDon't get me wrong: I agree that America's sexual conceptions are centered around\nstereotypical male sexuality, and I agree that this is damaging and problematic. Believe\nme, I'm furious that it took me many years to reconceive \"actual\" sex around acts other\nthan good ole penis-in-vagina penetration! But if American stereotypes and ideas of\nsexuality are male-centered, then surely that makes it more useful for us to be thinking\nabout male sexuality -- not less.\n\nAnd those male-centered ideas of sexuality aren't centered around all men -- just\nstereotypical men. LGBTQ men are obvious examples whose sexuality falls outside the\nnorm; fortunately for them, they've created some spaces to discuss that. But there are lots\nof other non-normative guys who aren't gay or queer, yet feel very similar sexual\nalienation -- and because there's so little discourse about masculinity outside LGBTQ\ncircles, they usually just don't talk about it.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a cis het man whose sexuality isn't normative? Which straight\ncis guys don't fit -- and hence, feel alienated from -- our current overarching sexual\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018574",
