  "text": "would otherwise be a complicated beyond reach situation. One of the properties\nfound around singularities, is the Joss of absoluteness in contextual characteristics\nsuch as the scale of the observation. We no longer can say that what we are\nstudying happens in inches or miles, in seconds or days, now or in the past. In the\nplace of a single unit of relevant measurement, we have a distribution of spatial and\ntemporal feature sizes that stretch toward both the infinitely small and the infinitely\nlarge.\n\nWe can illustrate a dynamical transition involving the passage of the system\nthrough a singularity by using the metaphor of another kind of water experiment. If\nwe pour a small amount of water through a filter full of coffee grounds, or watch our\ncoffee maker do it, the first spurt of water makes an incomplete path of wet grounds\nin the bed of dry ones. The next bit of water soaks this path more thoroughly and\nmay form additional and multiple, new and branching, incompletely penetrating\npaths. Eventually, on just one more of these pourings, a connection in the paths\noccur, such that the water snakes all the way through the coffee grounds and the\nfirst brown drop of coffee falls into the pot. At this flow singularity and opposite to\nthe dynamic of a faucet water drop, a discontinuous system of pathways becomes\ncontinuous in finite time in a process called percolation,\n\nTrying to set up a predictive model, we can count the number of water\ndeliveries that occur before the first drop finds its way through. Repeating the\nexperiment many times yields a span of the number of pours required to reach the\nsingular point of percolation. If we do the experiment enough times, the distribution\nof the number of pours required to reach percolation will range from one toward\ninfinite. In the neighborhood of the transition, time as recorded as the number of\nsmall pouring events may stretch.\n\nIn aa comparable system, as elegantly described by Detrich Stauffer in his\nSpringer-Verlag book on percolation, multiple hot spots in the woods can suddenly\nfuse into a forest fire. Isaiah said, “...glorify the Lord in the growing fires of dawn...”\nFaith fires spreading through a faithless dense forest, its hot irregular front damped\nby the disbelief of water-filled leaves, or disillusionment gaps of already burned out\n\ntrees, can, under the right motivating conditions of dryness, wind velocity, tree\n\n132\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013632",
