I'm not sure how you want to\n\ntake it, if you want to have opposing counsel speak on those\nissues now and then move to the others, or if you want us to\nkeep moving through it?\n\nTHI\n\n1a\n\nCOURT: What's your preference?\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: I think keep moving through it would be\n\ngreat.\n\nTHE COURT: What?\n\nGl\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: To keep moving it through it, if that's\n\nall right, so we can get through argument and then have them\naddress it?\n\nTHE, COURT: Sure.\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Thank you, your Honor.\n\nMS.
