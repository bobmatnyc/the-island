  "text": "Page 78 of 78\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *970\n\nAs of this writing, the ultimate disposition of Senator Kyl's bill remains uncertain. But what 1s certain is that congressional\ninterest in crime victims’ rights will remain strong. Congress has been working on far reaching crime victims’ rights legislation\nfor several decades now and, indeed, many in Congress favor an amendment to the United States Constitution to protect\nvictims' rights. °!! Against that backdrop, it is unlikely that Congress will permit the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure to\nonly haphazardly protect victims’ rights. If the Advisory Committee does not complete the task of comprehensively reforming\nthe Rules to protect victims, Congress almost certainly will - and should - finish the job.\n\nUtah Law Review\nCopyright (c) 2007 Utah Law Review Society\n\nEnd of Document\n\n6ll See supra notes 30-35 and accompanying text.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017713",
