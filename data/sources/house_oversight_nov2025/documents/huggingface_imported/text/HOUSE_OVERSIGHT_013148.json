  "text": "232 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics\n\nTweets and Youtube comments have their place in the cosmos, but they probably aren’t ideal\nin terms of helping humanity to form a coherent volition of some sort, suitable for providing an\nAGI with goal system guidance.\n\nA description of communication at the opposite end of the spectrum is presented in Adam\nKahane and Peter Senge’s excellent book Solving Tough Problems [IkS04], which describes a\nmethodology that has been used to reconcile deeply conflicting views in some very tricky real-\nworld situations (e.g. helping to peacefully end apartheid in South Africa).\n\nOne of the core ideas of the methodology is to have people with very different views explore\ndifferent possible future scenarios together, in great detail — in cognitive psychology terms, a\ncollective generation of hypothetical episodic knowledge. This has multiple benefits, including\n\ne emotional bonds and mutual understanding are built in the process of collaboratively ex-\nploring the scenarios\n\ne the focus on concrete situations helps to break through some of the counterproductive\nabstract ideas that people (on both sides of any dichotomy) may have formed\n\n® emergence of conceptual blends that might never have arisen only from people with a single\npoint of view\n\nThe result of such a process, when successful, is not an \"average\" of the participants views, but\nmore like a \"conceptual blend\" of their perspectives.\n\nAccording to conceptual blending, which some hypothesize to be the core algorithm of cre-\nativity [FT02], new concepts are formed by combining key aspects of existing concepts — but\ndoing so judiciously, carefully choosing which aspects to retain, so as to obtain a high-quality\nand useful and interesting new whole.\n\nA blend is a compact entity that is similar to each of the entities blended, capturing their\n\"essences\" but also possessing its own, novel holistic integrity.... But in the case of blending\ndifferent peoples’ world-views to form something new that everybody is going to have to live\nwith (as in the case of finding a peaceful path beyond apartheid for South Africa, or arriving\nat. a humanity-wide CBV to use to guide an AGI goal system), the trick is that everybody has\nto agree that enough of the essence of their own view has been captured!\n\nThis leads to the question of how to foster deep conceptual blending of diverse and divergent\nhuman perspectives, on a global scale. One possible answer is the creation of appropriate Global\nBrain oriented technologies — but moving away from technologies like Twitter that focus on quick\nand simple exchanges of small thoughts within affinity groups. On the face of it, it would seem\nwhat’s needed is just the opposite — long and deep exchanges of big concepts and deep feelings\nbetween individuals with radically different perspectives who would not commonly associate\nwith each other. Building and effectively popularizing Internet technologies capable to foster\nthis kind of interaction — quickly enough to be helpful with guiding the goal systems of the first\nhighly powerful AGIs — seems a significant, though fascinating, challenge.\n\nRelationship with Coherent Extrapolated Volition\n\nThe relation between this approach and CEV is interesting to contemplate. CEV has been\nloosely described as follows:\n\n\"In poetic terms, our coherent extrapolated volition is our wish if we knew more, thought faster,\nwere more the people we wished we were, had grown up farther together; where the extrapolation\nconverges rather than diverges, where our wishes cohere rather than interfere; extrapolated as\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013148",
