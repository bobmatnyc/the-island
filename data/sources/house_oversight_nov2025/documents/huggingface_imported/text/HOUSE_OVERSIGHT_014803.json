The allegations made by Victoria\nRoberts against Ghislaine Maxwell are untrue. The original allegations are not new and have\nbeen fully responded to and shown to be untrue.\n\nEach time the story is re told it changes with new salacious details about public figures and\nworld leaders and now it is alleged by Ms Roberts that Alan Derschowitz is involved in having\nsexual relations with her, which he denies.\n\nMs Roberts claims are obvious lies and should be treated as such and not publicised as news, as\nthey are defamatory.\n\nGhislaine Maxwell's original response to the lies and defamatory claims remains the same.\nMaxwell strongly denies allegations of an unsavoury nature, which have appeared in the British\npress and elsewhere and reserves her right to seek redress at the repetition of such old\n\ndefamatory claims.\n\nSent from my BlackBerry® wireless device\n\nGM_00068\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014803",
