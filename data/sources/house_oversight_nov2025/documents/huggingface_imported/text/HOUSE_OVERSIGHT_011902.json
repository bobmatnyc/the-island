But both Bibi and I knew we were going to avoid that if at all possible,\nand we did. Though there were inevitable civilian casualties, most of the\nPalestinians killed were Hamas fighters and leaders, including not just Jabari but\nthe head of Hamas’s rocket program. By limiting ourselves to air strikes and naval\nfire, the Palestinian death toll was around 150, about one-tenth of what it had been\nin 2008. Six Israelis, including four civilians, lost their lives. On the 21* of\nNovember, the cease-fire was announced.\n\nYet with the election approaching, and my time in public life drawing to a\nclose, I had no illusion that this latest military operation, or future ones, would\nbring us closer to the negotiating peace with the Palestinians that had eluded us\nsince Oslo. Nor was I confident that, having been unable to mount a military strike\nof our own on Iran, Obama’s “bigger, stronger kid” in the schoolyard would take\nmilitary action. I did trust him to do all he could to use diplomacy to constrain\nIran’s efforts to get a bomb. I feared he might fail. Even if he succeeded, I figured\nthe best case would be an agreement that, at least on paper, delayed the Iranians’\ndevelopment of a weapon. My hope remained that Israel’s relationship with the\nAmericans would be sufficiently strong for us to reach a formal understanding of\nwhat form of surgical military strike each of our countries might take if Iran didn’t\nhonor the terms of a negotiated deal.\n\nWhen I first left political life after my election defeat in 2001, I'd described my\nstatus as the equivalent of a reserve officer. I said, and believed, it was unlikely P’'d\nreturn for the foreseeable future. But I knew it wasn’t impossible. This time was\ndifferent. When I announced publicly that I was leaving politics, five days after the\nGaza cease-fire, I pointed that I had spent the greater part of my life as a soldier.\nI’d never had a burning desire to be a politician. Though I believed that what I'd\nattempted, and achieved, in government would prove to have safeguarded and\nstrengthened Israel, I knew that important challenges and decisions still lay ahead.\nSo did our unfulfilled dream of being a country that was not just strong, secure and\nprosperous, but socially just and at peace. Yet I believed it was right to draw my\ntime on the front line of politics to an end. Though I didn’t say so, I thought to\nmyself: this time doesn’t feel like a step back into the reserves, but genuinely like\nthe end of something. Though my dedication to a secure, strong, just, democratic\nand ultimately peaceful Israel would not change, whatever contribution I might\n\n431\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011902",
