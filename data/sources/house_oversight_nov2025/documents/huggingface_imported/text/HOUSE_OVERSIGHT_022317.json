  "text": "54046\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\neffective date of the rule is 75 days after\npublication in the Federal Register.21%\n\nList of Subjects in 29 CFR Part 104\n\nAdministrative practice and\nprocedure, Employee rights, Labor\nunions.\n\nText of Final Rule\n\nAccordingly, a new part 104 is added\nto 29 CFR chapter 1 to read as follows:\n\nPART 104—NOTIFICATION OF\nEMPLOYEE RIGHTS; OBLIGATIONS\nOF EMPLOYERS\n\nSubpart A—Definitions, Requirements for\nEmployee Notice, and Exceptions and\nExemptions\n\nSec.\n\n104.201 What definitions apply to this part?\n\n104.202 What employee notice must\nemployers subject to the NLRA post in\nthe workplace?\n\n104.203 Are Federal contractors covered\nunder this part?\n\n104.204 What entities are not subject to this\npart?\n\nAppendix to Subpart A—Text of Employee\nNotice\n\nSubpart B—General Enforcement and\nComplaint Procedures\n\n104.210 How will the Board determine\nwhether an employer is in compliance\nwith this part?\n\n104.211 What are the procedures for filing\na charge?\n\n104.212 What are the procedures to be\nfollowed when a charge is filed alleging\nthat an employer has failed to post the\nrequired employee notice?\n\n104.213 What remedies are available to cure\na failure to post the employee notice?\n\n104.214 How might other Board\nproceedings be affected by failure to post\nthe employee notice?\n\nSubpart C—Ancillary Matters\n\n104.220 What other provisions apply to this\npart?\n\nrule’ because, as explained in the discussion of the\nRegulatory Flexibility Act above, the Board has\nestimated that the average cost of compliance with\nthe rule will be approximately $64.40 per affected\nemployer; thus, because there are some 6 million\nemployers that could potentially be affected by the\nrule, the total cost to the economy of compliance\nwith the rule will be approximately $386.4 million.\nAs further explained, nearly all of that cost will be\nincurred during the year in which the rule takes\neffect; in subsequent years, the only costs of\ncompliance will be those incurred by employers\nthat either open new facilities or expand existing\nones, and those that for one reason or another fail\nto comply with the rule during the first year. The\nBoard therefore expects that the costs of compliance\nwill be far less than $100 million in the second and\nsubsequent years. The Board is confident that the\nrule will have none of the effects enumerated in 5\nU.S.C. 804(2)(B) and (C) above.\n\n213 The Board finds unpersuasive the suggestions\nin several comments that the effective date of the\nrule be postponed to as late as April 15, 2012. The\nBoard finds nothing in the requirements of the rule\nor in the comments received that would warrant\npostponing the effective date.\n\nAuthority: National Labor Relations Act\n(NLRA), Section 6, 29 U.S.C. 156;\nAdministrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 553.\n\nSubpart A—Definitions, Requirements\nfor Employee Notice, and Exceptions\nand Exemptions\n\n§ 104.201\npart?\n\nEmployee includes any employee, and\nis not limited to the employees of a\nparticular employer, unless the NLRA\nexplicitly states otherwise.
