  "text": "arts and still make a full-time income on only four hours a week. The best part of this is that I have\nfound mentally the meaning of freedom. Reality is truly negotiable and now my reality is that I can\nspend endless hours enjoying the company of my father, who waited twenty years till he retired to enjoy\nthe freedom that I have found less than 24 months after reading The 4-Hour Workweek.\n\nAs an immigrant I want to spread the message that to succeed in America in the 21st century we must\nNOT work hard, instead we must follow the principles of the 4HWW and work smarter so that we can\ntruly achieve the New American Dream: Freedom to enjoy the most precious resource we have in life ...\nour time on this earth.\n\n—I. BARRON\n\nPHOTO FINISH\n\nHey Tim,\n\nI wanted to tell you that your book, The 4-Hour Workweek, has been a true inspiration and life-\nchanging resource for me this year!\n\nI bought your book in November. Before then, I didn’t know what “workflow automation” was. I had\na part-time employee, but her work was actually creating more work for me. I would work until\nsometimes 3 A.M., and get up at 7. I'd tell you I wanted to travel, but the truth is that it seemed\nimpossible to me. I didn’t have time or money.\n\nI was listening to your audio book one day. I had been listening to each of the chapters, sometimes\nover and over again. I was jogging. I stopped in my tracks. I believe I was listening about a case study\nabout someone who sold music files over the Internet.\n\nI’m a photographer. Weddings mostly. I wondered how I could sell digital images over the Internet.\nThen I came up with a fantastic idea for a family photography company. I stopped right there, and\nreserved a website on my iPhone.\n\nTwo months later, I had a website, access to thousands of photographers across the country, and our\nfirst sale. Even better, I am now in the family photography business, and I never have to shoot myself.\nEven better +1, we are the first family photography business that doesn’t sell prints. Only digital files. It\nworked! I have now adopted this for my wedding photography as well. Other photographers are so\noffended, but I am making WAY more $, my costs are almost eliminated, and my time is free!\n\nI know the above is vague, but it’s not the point. The point is that now I work better, faster, I have two\nmore employees, I turned off my e-mail notifications on my computer and my iPhone, despite all of what\nit’s capable of, it doesn’t even ring. E-mail has been disabled. I just check it every so often to see what\ncalls I missed.\n\nToday, my fiance loves me because I come home in time for dinner and I leave my laptop at work. It’s\na life I never thought Id be able to live. In the meantime, systems are working in my place and this year\nlooks to be a lot better, financially, than last.\n\nThen I decided it was time to try my first mini-retirement. The goal: ski the Swiss Alps and spend five\ndays in Switzerland and spend less than $1,000 total. I got a roundtrip ticket for about 500 bucks. My ski\npass for one day at Engelberg was $80. Lodging was free, thanks to your suggestion\nwww.couchsurfing.com, and I ate roasted chestnuts, brats, fish and chips and drank great beer all week\nlong. I did it!\n\nI am forever grateful, and am excited for more mini-retirements. Here’s to living during the best years\nof my life.\n\nP.S. I leave May 11 for a month-long work vacation to Italy (I have been hired to photograph two\nweddings in Siena). I plan on vacationing a LOT more than I will be working.\n\n— MARK CAFIERO, Photographer\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014020",
