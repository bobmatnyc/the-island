  "text": "designed to get taxpayers through a particularly difficult period — such as the expiring extender dealing with\nmortgage forgiveness. Enacted at the end of 2007 in response to turmoil in the housing market, this\nprovision was designed to help borrowers who were underwater with their home mortgages: previously, ifa\nlender foreclosed on a home and sold it for less than the outstanding indebtedness, the forgiveness of the\nunpaid balance generated taxable income for the borrower, as did a renegotiated mortgage that reduced the\noutstanding indebtedness. Under this temporary provision, that forgiveness is not considered income —a\nwelcome result for taxpayers in this unhappy situation.\n\nYet what about temporary provisions that promote favored tax policies but that don’t respond to a particular\nsituation? If they're such a good idea, why not make them permanent? This gets to a basic reality:\npermanent provisions are more costly than temporary ones. That is because the Joint Committee on\nTaxation must use a current law “baseline” when it estimates the revenue impact of tax legislation. Such a\nbaseline assumes that a temporary measure, such as the mortgage forgiveness mentioned above,\ngenerates only a short-term revenue loss, and will expire as scheduled — even if that is unlikely to occur.\nThis means that such measures can paint a rosier fiscal picture than is perhaps justified, and can therefore\nbe a more “cost-effective” way to continue desired tax benefits (and policies), regardless of how inefficient\nand counter-productive the resulting uncertainty may be.\n\nThese current expiring extenders seem likely to languish — at least for a bit, especially considering that the\nHouse has already recessed for the year. Although Congress has often renewed expiring provisions\nretroactively, such a move early next year could take some of the steam out of tax reform (assuming it has a\nchance). In addition, despite how inherently worthy these expiring provisions may be, Congress is under\nless pressure to pass extenders legislation because of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA)\n(Pub. L. 112-240). That is, in addition to making most of the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent, ATRA,\nwhich was enacted on January 2, 2013, made the “granddaddy’ of extenders permanent, by permanently\nindexing the AMT exemption for inflation, thereby permanently sparing over 25+ million taxpayers from the\nAMT, as opposed to the “mere” 4+ million currently affected by it (recall that the earliest incarnation of the\nAMT in the late 1960’s was in response to 155 taxpayers who paid no income tax through use of permissible\ncredits and deductions).\n\nTax reform — and extenders — are thus moving targets. Even though Rep. Camp and Sen. Baucus, along\nwith others in Congress, say they would like to address tax reform in 2014, that is a tall order: not only will\nmembers of Congress soon be pre-occupied with the November mid-term elections, there is also that small\nmatter of the philosophical divide between Republicans and Democrats — Republicans want tax reform to be\nrevenue-neutral, while Democrats want higher taxes on the top 1% to 2% of taxpayers. Finally, the latest fly\nin the ointment is that Sen. Baucus, who is not running for re-election in 2014, reportedly will be nominated\nas the next ambassador to China — meaning that he will not complete his final term in office, assuming he is\nconfirmed. Does this take additional momentum away from the prospect of tax reform in 2014? Arguably\nyes, although Sen. Ron Wyden (D-OR), who could be Sen. Baucus’s successor as Chairman of the Senate\nFinance Committee, is also interested in tax reform and has previously put forth bipartisan tax reform\nproposals. It will be interesting to see what develops.\n\nEnd of the year recap\n\nWith the end of 2013 upon us, we wanted to highlight a few of the tax and political developments that stood\nout to us this year, and that have long-term implications:\n\nATRA. As mentioned above, the American Taxpayer Relief Act (ATRA) made the AMT “patch” and most of\nthe 2001 and 2003 tax cuts permanent. It also raised taxes on the top 1% to 2% of taxpayers, in part, by\nbringing back the top income tax rate of 39.6% and, for those at that rate, the 20% rate on qualified\ndividends and most long-term capital gains. In addition, ATRA reinstated the personal exemption phase-out\nand what is generally a 3% limitation on itemized deductions, such as for mortgage interest, state and local\n\nTax Topics 12/20/13 2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022326",
