  "text": "I am more than happy to discuss different ways to make this possible and I have some suggestions if\n[company name] would be willing to consider them. We can test this arrangement for a few months to\nsee if it works for both of us, since that would make the most sense.\n\nRole #1: Graphic Design and Print Advertising Coordinator\nResponsibility:\n\nCreate timelines for print materials and coordinate with respective program teams.\n\nExpectations:\ne Print materials will be completed on time.\n\nResponsibility:\nCoordinate design projects with program directors and outside graphic artists/designers.\n\nExpectations:\n\ne Print materials designs are suitable for the audience, accurate, and appealing.\n\ne Print materials are professional quality and produced within set timelines.\n\nResponsibility:\nMaintain relationships with print vendors to minimize cost relative to time and quality in producing\nprogram print materials.\n\nExpectations:\n\ne Print materials are printed within the established budget, unless budget overages are specifically\napproved by the Director of Marketing.\n\nContract Solution:\nBy using e-mail and web-based programs such as\n\n*ConceptShare, I can continue to coordinate these design projects from a distance.

For meetings with program directors and the marketing team, I would use a free video and\nphone conferencing service called *Skype. We usually meet once or twice to discuss changes to their\nmarketing materials and the rest of the process is continued through e-mail and ConceptShare.\n\nRole #2: Special Marketing Project Manager\nResponsibility:\n\nMaintain a collection of updated, appropriate marketing images.\nExpectations:\n\ne Images needed for marketing materials and websites are anticipated and acquired.\n\nContract Solution:\n\nI am still able to complete this task remotely by doing images searches on web databases such as\n*iStockphoto.com. If the experiment with the *Seminar Photo Contest fares well, I could also manage\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014014",
