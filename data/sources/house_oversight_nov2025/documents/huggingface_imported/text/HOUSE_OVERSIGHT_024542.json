Hunter Elementary School\n\nBackground, In the Spring of 2004 the School District of Philadelphia wished to give a rebirth to one of its\nlowest performing schools, the William H. Hunter Elementary School. k12 was selected as a partner to\nprovide innovative curriculum and professional development to implement a learning environment that\nleverages the latest technology. As part of the k12 implementation, the District outfitted each room with\nhigh-speed internet access, a ceiling-mounted data projection system, and interactive whiteboards. The\ngoal was to have Hunter become one of the District's, and the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s, first\nweb-based public, traditional schools.\n\nOf Hunter's 600 students, 95% qualify for the federal Free and Reduced Lunch program and 25% study\nEnglish as a Second Language (ESL). Therefore, the move and the District's initiative truly marked a\ntremendous opportunity for both Hunter's teachers and students alike.\n\nScope of Services. The fall of 2004 marked the official launch of the program and the k12 curriculum was\nprovided for all math, science, art and history courses. This included providing all curriculum components\nincluding text books, teacher guides, manipulatives, equipment, assessments, art supplies and all the\nonline lessons and teaching tools for these subjects.\n\nThe Hunter teaching staff did an impressive job of effectively implementing the program. k12 trainers\nworked closely with teachers to adopt the new curriculum and to share best methods on applying the\ntechnology. Throughout the year, k12 trainers were invited to attend and help present ongoing staff\ntrainings. Additionally, grade level teams and school leaders worked regularly with k12 to develop\ncoherent plans for boosting student achievement.\n\nResults / Conclusions: After the first full-year of implementing the k12 program, Hunter achieved\nimpressive gains on the state math exams.” In third grade, there was a 46 percentage point increase (as\n\n*° The Pennsylvania Department of Education mandates all public schools in the Commonwealth implement its Pennsylvania System of State\nAssessment (PSSA). The PSSA is a standards-based exam for measuring specific skills in math and reading, and beginning in 2006-07 science.\n\n109\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024542",
