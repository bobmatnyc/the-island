  "text": "Conclusion\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe FCPA was designed to prevent corrupt practices, protect investors,\nand provide a fair playing field for those honest companies trying to win busi-\nness based on quality and price rather than bribes. Following Congress’ leader-\nship in enacting the FCPA 35 years ago, and through determined international\ndiplomatic and law enforcement efforts in the time since, laws like the FCPA\nprohibiting foreign bribery have been enacted by most of the United States’\nmajor trading partners.\n\nThis guide is designed to provide practical advice about, and useful in-\nsights into, our enforcement considerations. For businesses desiring to com-\npete fairly in foreign markets, it is our goal to maximize those businesses’ ability\nto comply with the FCPA in the most effective and efficient way suitable to their\nbusiness and the markets in which they operate. Through our ongoing efforts\nwith the U.S. and international business and legal communities and non-\ngovernmental organizations, DOJ and SEC can continue effectively to protect\n\nthe integrity of our markets and reduce corruption around the world.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022592",
