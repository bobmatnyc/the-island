  "text": "Suddenly, the question of how the president might respond to the attack in Khan\nSheikhoun was a litmus test for normality and those who hoped to represent it in Trump’s\nWhite House. Here was the kind of dramatic juxtaposition that might make for a vivid and\nefficient piece of theater: people working in the Trump White House who were trying to\nbehave normally.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nSurprisingly, perhaps, there were quite a few such people.\n\nActing normal, embodying normality—doing things the way a striving, achieving,\nrational person would do them—was how Dina Powell saw her job in the White House. At\nforty-three, Powell had made a career at the intersection of the corporate world and public\npolicy; she did well (very, very well) by doing good. She had made great strides in George\nW. Bush’s White House and then later at Goldman Sachs. Returning to the White House at\na penultimate level, with at least a chance of rising to one of the country’s highest\nunelected positions, would potentially be worth enormous sums when she returned to the\ncorporate world.\n\nIn Trumpland, however, the exact opposite could happen. Powell’s carefully cultivated\nreputation, her brand (and she was one of those people who thought intently about their\npersonal brand), could become inextricably tied to the Trump brand. Worse, she could\nbecome part of what might easily turn into historical calamity. Already, for many people\nwho knew Dina Powell—and everybody who was anybody knew Dina Powell—the fact\nthat she had taken a position in the Trump White House indicated either recklessness or\nseriously bad judgment.\n\n“How,” wondered one of her longtime friends, “does she rationalize this?” Friends,\nfamily, and neighbors asked, silently or openly, Do you know what you’re doing? And how\ncould you? And why would you?\n\nHere was the line dividing those whose reason for being in the White House was a\nprofessed loyalty to the president from the professionals they had needed to hire. Bannon,\nConway, and Hicks—along with an assortment of more or less peculiar ideologues that\nhad attached themselves to Trump and, of course, his family, all people without clearly\nmonetizable reputations before their association with Trump—were, for better or worse,\nhitched to him. (Even among dedicated Trumpers there was always a certain amount of\nholding their breath and constant reexamination of their options.) But those within the\nlarger circle of White House influence, those with some stature or at least an imagined\nstature, had to work through significantly more complicated contortions of personal and\ncareer justification.\n\nOften they wore their qualms on their sleeves. Mick Mulvaney, the OMB director,\nmade a point of stressing the fact that he worked in the Executive Office Building, not the\nWest Wing.
