  "text": "entitled to any kind of sex from a partner -- ever. If your partner loves you but doesn't\nwant to have sex with you? That's a respectable choice. If you're really turned on, but\nyour partner can't stand the idea of having sex right now? That's a respectable choice.\nThose two are easy, I think, but how about these?\n\n+ If your partner used to do something with you a lot, but doesn't want to do it anymore?\nThat's a respectable choice.\n\n+ If you are married to your partner, but ze doesn't want to have sex? That's a respectable\nchoice.\n\n+ If your partner performed a sexual act with another partner but would prefer not to do it\nwith you? That's a respectable choice.\n\n+ If you know your partner likes a certain kind of sex, but they don't want to do it right\nnow? That's a respectable choice.\n\n+ If you think a certain act is \"mild\" and \"taken for granted,\" like kissing or tickling, but\nyour partner doesn't want to do it? That's a respectable choice.\n\nBy the way, if you (like I once did) feel as though your partner is entitled to sex of any\nkind, I encourage you to re-examine that feeling. Ditto if you've got a little voice in your\nhead telling you that you \"ought to\" be up for sex all the time just because you don't get it\nvery often... or that you \"ought to” be up for sex if you've done it with your partner\nbefore... or whatever. The other best thing that ever happened to my sex life was when I\nfinally, finally, finally internalized the idea that my partners don't ever \"deserve\" sex for\nany reason -- that there's no reason I ever \"should\" be having sex -- and that the only\nreason I should ever, ever, ever do anything sexual is because I legitimately want to.\n\nOf course, if you truly believe that you need a certain kind of sexuality in your life, then\nyou're absolutely entitled to ask your partner to consider it -- and you're entitled to leave\nthe relationship if ze isn't up for it. But this doesn't mean that you \"deserve\" to do that act\nwith that person, or that your partner \"owes\" you a certain act.\n\nAnd hey, if your partner isn't down with one specific sexual act, then that means you've\ngot the chance to explore all kinds of other sexuality. Another other best thing that ever\nhappened to my sexuality? Quite possibly, it's my current boyfriend -- whose religious\nadherence has drastically limited our physical sexual options.\n\nThomas MacAulay Millar:\n\nWe're each entitled to our own identity, but not to our own partner. Our partners are\npeople, with thoughts and desires and limits of their own, and they don't have to do what\nwe want them to do. This goes for tops, too! Tops have limits! Because of my blogging\ncovenant with my spouse (what I do as a bottom is personal to me and I decide how much\nI reveal; what she does as a bottom is personal to her and she prefers that those stories not\nbe blogfodder) I don't have any really good stories to share about hitting my limits as a\ntop. But they exist. Tops are not required to be into everything a bottom is into, and they\ndamned sure are under no obligation to do things that make them uncomfortable just\nbecause the bottom wants it -- whether the reason for the discomfort is risk tolerance,\nideology, squeamishness or anything else. Tops can say, \"no, I won't suspend you from\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018471",
