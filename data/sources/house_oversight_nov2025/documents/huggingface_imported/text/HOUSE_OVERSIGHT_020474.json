In one instance, after a visit to China supported by CAIFC, an\nAmerican congressional official was asked by two employees at CAIFC who facilitated his\ntrip to host them during a return visit to Washington. He obliged, and they were seemingly\nsatisfied, having shopped extensively during their stay. Subsequently, the Chinese embassy\nofficers who had arranged the congressional official’s visit to China with CAIFC were\narrested and expelled for trying to steal US weapons technology, causing the US official to\nend all contact with CAIFC.\n\nCurrent Era\n\nTensions in US-China relations subsided after the terrorist attack on America in September\n2001 and subsequent wars in Afghanistan and Iraq preoccupied the Bush administration\nand Congress. Chinese and American leaders also proved to be sufficiently pragmatic to\nreach common ground on advancing relations in mutually agreeable ways and managing\ndifferences through a wide range of dialogues. Such exchanges only catalyzed visits by\nmore congressional members and staff delegations visits to China. At this time, members\noften traveled to China in US government-—funded trips as guests of the US embassy. Some\nmember trips and very frequent staff delegation visits were authorized under provisions\n\nof the Mutual Education and Cultural Exchange Act (MECEA) that were in line with the\nguidance of congressional ethics committees.’ In addition to the work of the US-Asia\nInstitute, those organizing and facilitating staff delegations grew to include the Aspen\nInstitute, the National Committee on US-China Relations, and the US-China Policy\nFoundation.”\n\nChina also increased its own capacity to engage Congress beyond trips. Having moved into\na new embassy in Washington in 2009, the Chinese embassy increased its congressional\naffairs staff to twelve (as of 2011), while also retaining the lobbying services of the firm\nPatton Boggs.'! During his time as ambassador, Zhou Wenzhong boasted that he had visited\nsome one hundred members of Congress in their home districts. When certain measures,\nsuch as a bill that would have penalized China for being a “currency manipulator,” came\nbefore Congress, the embassy’s in-house team’s efforts reflected what some US officials\ncalled a much more “nuanced” and “sophisticated” understanding of the body. Whether or\nnot Chinese officials or lobbyists interacting with congressional offices endeavored to exert\ninfluence by means beyond persuasion—such as by offering material benefits or threatening\nto withdraw Chinese investments or other tangible benefits to the congressional district—\nremained hard to discern given the very limited public reporting on such matters.”\n\nCongress, for its part, had already formalized efforts to better understand China through\n\na variety of working groups. By 2006, both the House and the Senate had formed a\nUS-China Inter-Parliamentary Exchange Group, which conducted periodic exchanges with\nChina’s National People’s Congress. Also showing stronger American interest in China at\nthat time were the Congressional China Caucus (led by members tending to be critical\n\nSection 1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020474",
