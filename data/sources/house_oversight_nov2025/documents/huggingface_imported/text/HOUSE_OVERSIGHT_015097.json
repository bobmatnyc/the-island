  "text": "Whittaker Chambers, against Senator Joseph McCarthy and against J.\nEdgar Hoover. In that vein, gossips used to rant about Hoover and Clyde\nTolson double-dating with Charles “Bebe” Rebozo and myself.\n\nNeither Rebozo nor! are “gay.” We have been very close friends\nsince 1950. What we enjoy most about each other’ s company is the fact\nthat small talk becomes unnecessary. We are not afraid of silence. But we\nhave never had any kind of sexual relationship.\n\nWe were introduced by Senator George Smathers, who was\ninfamous for supplying female companions to his fellow legislators. It was\nSmathers who eventually sent Mary Jo Kopechne to be with Senator\nEdward Kennedy.\n\nWhenever | was in Florida, | would stay with Bebe, and he would\noccasionally get a couple of beautiful $200-a-night girls. Or as they would\nbe called nowadays, $200-a-night women. But when | bought my own\nhome in Key Biscayne, then his yacht became our rendezvous site.\n\n| was certainly not promiscuous, but | had been a virgin until\nmarriage. | proposed to Pat Ryan the very same night | met her. She\nrefused, but | was a determined son-of-a-gun. | even drove her to Los\nAngeles when she dated other men while | waited in the wings. | finally\n\ncharmed her with my perseverance and self-effacement.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015097",
