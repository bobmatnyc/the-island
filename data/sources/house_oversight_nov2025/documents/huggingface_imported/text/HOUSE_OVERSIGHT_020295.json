She urgently texted Snowden on what she called “background” (which ordinarily\nmeans that a journalist will not attribute information to a source.) She asked him in the text to\nexplain the NSA’s actions. Snowden explained to her that Merkel was listed by her true name\n(and not by a codename) in the NSA document because the German chancellor was a NSA\n“target not an asset.” Presumably, Poitras would have already known that distinction if she had\nthe document referred to in Der Spiegel. If the Merkel document was not among the data given\nto Poitras in Hong Kong , how did it get to the authors of the Der Spiegel article?\n\nOne of the authors, Appelbaum, as discussed earlier, had been in contact with Snowden\nbefore he went public. He had served as Poitras’ co-interrogator of Snowden while he was still\nworking at the NSA in May 2013. Appelbaum also, was one of the leading supporters of\nWikileaks. Since he was famously an advocate of revealing government secrets, it seems unlikely\nthat he would have delayed releasing such a bombshell about Merkel’s phone if Snowden had\ngiven him this document before he had left Hong Kong in June 2013. Why would Appelbaum\nkept it secret for more than four months? The same pressure to publish would also apply to the\njournalists Snowden had dealt with in Hong Kong. If Snowden had given Poitras, Greenwald,\nLam or MacAskill the Merkel document, or even told them about it in their interviews with him in\nHong Kong, the Guardian would have certainly rushed out such a scoop.\n\nAccording to source with knowledge of the Snowden investigation, there was no document\nreferencing any spying on Merkel’s phone among the 58,000 documents on the thumb drive that\nSnowden had given Poitras and Greenwald in Hong Kong. That absence would explain why\nPoitras had to send a text to Snowden in Moscow to ask for an explanation after the story broke.\nFurther confirmation of the absence of this document in the material Snowden provided\njournalists in Hong Kong comes from James Bamford, a well-respected expert on the NSA. In the\ncourse of researching his 2014 article on Snowden for Wired magazine, he was given access to all\nthe documents Snowden gave to Poitras, Greenwald and Gellman. Bamford used a sophisticated\nindexing program to search through the database specifically for The Merkel material. , Even so,\nhe did not find any. He reported that no document that even mentioned Merkel given to\njournalists in Hong Kong mentioned Merkel. It therefore appeared that the Merkel document was\nprovided to Der Spiegel after Snowden went to Moscow in June. If so, some party had access to\nNSA documents after Snowden arrived in Russia and provided the authors of the Der Spiegel\nstory with the scoop. In that context, it may have not been a pure coincide that Kucherena’s\ndisclosed that Snowden had access to documents which he had not given to journalists in Hong\nKong shortly before just such a document was [published in Germany.\n\nFor his part, Bamford explored the possibility that there might be another mole in the NSA.\nWas it possible another person in the NSA was stealing documents? He wrote Poitras and asked\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020295",
