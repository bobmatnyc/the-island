Dear Jeffrey,

Apropos of our conversation of a few minutes ago, This proposal went to someone I thought was
interested in the environment and science but who seems, in fact, far more interested in supporting TV
on a broad range of topics.

500,000 would fund this initiative as the second HGSE course (after Poetry of the City) and could begin
immediately, Jan 1. . I'd be thrilled to include other scientists you name, perhaps taping the group in a
session on metaphor at the edges of fields.

INote that taped sessions already include economics, marine biology, astronomy, evolutionary biology,
zoology, physics and computer science. Richard Dawkins, Walter Isaacson, David Mossberg and David
Malan have all said yes to tapings. Footage for all the others is already shot and ready for post
production.

I am having a drink with Dean of Ed School today and can explore this with him among other topics
