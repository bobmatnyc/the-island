How 1s it\nthat people maintain this rosy bias even when information\nchallenging our upbeat forecasts is so readily available? Only\nrecently have we been able to decipher this mystery, by scanning the\nbrains of people as they process both positive and negative\ninformation about the future. The findings are striking: when people\nlearn, their neurons faithfully encode desirable information that can\nenhance optimism but fail at incorporating unexpectedly undesirable\ninformation. When we hear a success story like Mark Zuckerberg's,\nour brains take note of the possibility that we too may become\nimmensely rich one day. But hearing that the odds of divorce are\nalmost 1 in 2 tends not to make us think that our own marriages may\nbe destined to fail. Why would our brains be wired in this way? It is\ntempting to speculate that optimism was selected by evolution\nprecisely because, on balance, positive expectations enhance the odds\nof survival. Research findings that optimists live longer and are\nhealthier, plus the fact that most humans display optimistic biases —\nand emerging data that optimism is linked to specific genes — all\nstrongly support this hypothesis. Yet optimism is also irrational and\ncan lead to unwanted outcomes. The question then is, How can we\nremain hopeful — benefiting from the fruits of optimism — while at\nthe same time guarding ourselves from its pitfalls?\n\nI believe knowledge is key. We are not born with an innate\nunderstanding of our biases. The brain's illusions have to be\nidentified by careful scientific observation and controlled\nexperiments and then communicated to the rest of us. Once we are\nmade aware of our optimistic illusions, we can act to protect\nourselves. The good news is that awareness rarely shatters the\nillusion. The glass remains half full. It is possible, then, to strike a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030293",
