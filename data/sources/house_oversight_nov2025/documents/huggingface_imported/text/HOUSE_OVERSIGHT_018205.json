  "text": "regime does in fact survive, Iran would become increasingly emboldened,\nwith potentially disastrous consequences for the United States and its\nallies and interests in the Middle East.\n\nDenuding U.S. forces in the region to enable a pivot to Asia 1s also risky.\nNowhere else in the world is America more likely to deploy forces than in\nthe Persian Gulf in opposition to Iran, and nowhere else is it of utmost\nimportance that any potential confrontation be won decisively in the next\nfive to ten years than with the Islamic Republic.\n\nGoing forward, Washington must discriminate between Iranian behaviors\nit considers unacceptable -- such as support for terrorism, hegemonic\nambitions, and progress toward nuclear weapons -- and those it can\ntolerate. U.S. officials could open the door for negotiations by making\nclear to Tehran that they do not seek regime change; the first step in that\nregard would be to let Iran know that Washington respects it as a nation-\nstate and not a transnational revolutionary movement.\n\nFinally, disorganization within the U.S. government and a \"go it alone\"\nmentality have accounted for many of Washington's internal difficulties in\nresponding to the Iranian challenge. To alleviate this problem, all cabinet-\nlevel officials must be in constant and complete coordination, devoid of\nroutine bureaucratic obstacles. In addition, the appointment of a senior\nsubcabinet official whose sole responsibility is Iran (or, alternatively, a\nsmall group of officials in constant coordination) could allow the\nadministration to reorganize bureaucratically in preparation for this year of\ndecision.\n\nTHOMAS PICKERING\n\nDiscussions of containment policy typically imply accepting the Islamic\nRepublic as an inevitable nuclear power and using deterrence to deal with\na nuclear-armed Iran. Yet such an outcome would be disastrous for U.S.\nnonproliferation policy, which is based on the notion that fewer nuclear\nstates means less chance of miscalculated use. If Iran attains a nuclear\nweapon, other regional powers would likely follow suit -- clearly an\nundesirable outcome for the international community.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018205",
