  "text": "The goals of Hard Gatekeeping are simple enough to state: To protect those inside\nthe gated order, to make security and innovation more efficient, to accelerate\ncertain kinds of connection and dampen others, to manage vulnerable links to the\nnon-gatekept world and - perhaps most important- to use that “in or out” leverage\nto relentlessly affect the interests and plans of others. These aims are the root of real\nsecurity in any age. “In anarchy, security is the highest end,” Kenneth Waltz wrote.\n“Only if survival is assured can states seek other goals such as tranquility, profit and\npower.”247 Survival - and Waltz’s other essential aims - will be decided by the\nnature of our future connection. In this sense, Hard Gatekeeping produces a decisive\nchange in our posture. It lets us aim for something instead of merely being against\nmovement or - hopelessly - against the future. It establishes priorities, clarifies our\nreal core interests, helps us budget our effort and our expenses — better, perhaps, to\nspend atrillon dollars building tools of topological mastery like infrastructure or\nnew technology than chasing Middle East peace.**® Gatekeeping does not transcend\nthe long-standing debates between the cold realism of Stalin and the idealism of\nWoodrow Wilson so much as it sets us a preliminary task: Shaping the environment.\nTo build and control the next generation of gatekept systems should be our aim\nnow. In the future paper currency wil be replaced by secure digital bit transactions.\nGenetic information will demand smart, live-connected platforms for efficient\nmining and study. Cyber and biological security will each come to be defined by\nhigh-speed, machine-intelligent protocols. All of these are gatekept cores. Mastering\nthem will be as important as having military bases, trade missions or treaty\narrangements once was. The development of such systems plays to our strengths;\nthey deliver both security and useful pressures of innovation. Remember - the aim\nisn’t to build walls. It is to use the logic of networks and gates, and all the complex\nproductive force they release.\n\nBs\nThe elements of Hard Gatekeeping can be stated simply enough:\n\nFirst, Does it work for us? We seek a landscape of technology, trade, finance,\nknowledge - all the tools of power - that balances the pressures of politics with a\ncolder grasp of longer-term national interest. The protocols, alliances, treaties and\ndata webs that enable markets, trade or thinking machines - all are gatelands we\ncan cultivate, improve and protect. Our gatelands must be designed to limit the\nrippling risks of contagion or error moving wildly, like spring weather, inside linked\ncomplex systems now. Control of topologies is what air superiority or sea mastery\nonce were. The opening attacks of future wars will come invisibly and silently\nthrough networks, in space, in fast topological strikes — not with noisy land\ninvasions or bombing runs. Well-built gates will give us time and leverage. They will\n\n247 “In anarchy”: Kenneth Waltz, Theory of International Politics, (Reading, MA:\nAddison-Wesley, 1979), 126\n\n248 It establishes: For a discussion about why a grand strategy is of practical use see\nHal Brands, “The Promise and Pitfalls of Grand Strategy,” Strategic Studies Institute,\nExternal Associates Monograph Program, 2012\n\n173\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018405",
