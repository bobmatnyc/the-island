This was\nreaffirmed in a letter to the King.\n\nAfter @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit, he changed the US stance on the MBS v MBN power struggle and\nforced the establishment to back MBS.\n\nPast US administrations were keen on avoiding strife within GCC: This is because American interests cannot be\nupheld without a harmonic GCC.\n\nThat was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported\nit contradicting Defence&State Dept\n\nThat was until @realDonaldTrump's return from Saudi upon which Qatar siege began and he openly supported\nit contradicting Defence&State Dept\n\nMore bizarrely; MBS has a secure direct line to Trump like no other leader has - not even Israeli Netanyahu &\nBritish May...\n\nThe following story explains MBS's 'special' influence over @realDonaldTrump - even if it means\ncompromising America's national interests...\n\nDuring @realDonaldTrump's Riyadh visit in May 2017 a private yacht discreetly arrived at Jeddah Port; heavily\nguarded and identity hidden.\n\nEven the Port's authorities were not allowed near it. Only a number of individuals reached it - delivering several\nboxes of cash ($1bn USD).\n\nAfter loading the boxes, the yacht disappeared. The operation lasted hours & was kept secret as was yacht's\nidentity, origin and destination\n\nIt transpired from MBS's inner circles that the $1bn was from MBS himself & the yacht belonged indirectly to\n@Trump Organisation. #Trump_ MBS\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032643",
