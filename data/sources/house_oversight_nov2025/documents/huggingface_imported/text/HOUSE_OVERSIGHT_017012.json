  "text": "periodicals such as newspapers). This final database contains bibliographic information for each of these\n129 million editions (Ref. $1). The country of publication is known for 85.3% of these editions, authors for\n87.8%, publication dates for 92.6%, and the language for 91.6%. Of the 15 million books scanned, the\ncountry of publication is known for 91.5%, authors for 92.1%, publication dates for 95.1%, and the\nlanguage for 98.6%.\n\nI.2. Digitization\n\nWe describe the way books are scanned and digitized. For publisher-provided books, Google removes\nthe spines and scans the pages with industrial sheet-fed scanners. For library-provided books, Google\nuses custom-built scanning stations designed to impose only as much wear on the book as would result\nfrom someone reading the book. As the pages are turned, stereo cameras overhead photograph each\npage, as shown in Figure $1.\n\nOne crucial difference between sheet-fed scanners and the stereo scanning process is the flatness of the\npage as the image is captured. In sheet-fed scanning, the page is kept flat, similar to conventional flatbed\nscanners. With stereo scanning, the book is cradled at an angle that minimizes stress on the spine of the\nbook (this angle is not shown in Figure $1). Though less damaging to the book, a disadvantage of the\nlatter approach is that it results in a page that is curved relative to the plane of the camera. The curvature\nchanges every time a page is turned, for several reasons: the attachment point of the page in the spine\ndiffers, the two stacks of pages change in thickness, and the tension with which the book is held open\nmay vary. Thicker books have more page curvature and more variation in curvature.\n\nThis curvature is measured by projecting a fixed infrared pattern onto each page of the book,\nsubsequently captured by cameras. When the image is later processed, this pattern is used to identify the\nlocation of the spine and to determine the curvature of the page. Using this curvature information, the\nscanned image of each page is digitally resampled so that the results correspond as closely as possible\nto the results of sheet-fed scanning. The raw images are also digitally cropped, cleaned, and contrast\nenhanced. Blurred pages are automatically detected and rescanned. Details of this approach can be\nfound in U.S. Patents 7463772 and 7508978; sample results are shown in Figure $2.\n\nFinally, blocks of text are identified and optical character recognition (OCR) is used to convert those\nimages into digital characters and words, in an approach described elsewhere (Ref. $2). The difficulty of\napplying conventional OCR techniques to Google’s scanning effort is compounded because of variations\nin language, font, size, paper quality, and the physical condition of the books being scanned.\nNevertheless, Google estimates that over 98% of words are correctly digitized for modern English books.\nAfter OCR, initial and trailing punctuation is stripped and word fragments split by hyphens are joined,\nyielding a stream of words suitable for subsequent indexing.\n\n1.3. Structure Extraction\n\nAfter the book has been scanned and digitized, the components of the scanned material are classified\ninto various types. For instance, individual pages are scanned in order to identify which pages comprise\nthe authored content of the book, as opposed to the pages which comprise frontmatter and backmatter,\nsuch as copyright pages, tables of contents, index pages, etc. Within each page, we also identify\nrepeated structural elements, such as headers, footers, and page numbers.\n\nUsing OCR results from the frontmatter and backmatter, we automatically extract author names, titles,\nISBNs, and other identifying information. This information is used to confirm that the correct consensus\nrecord has been associated with the scanned text.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017012",
