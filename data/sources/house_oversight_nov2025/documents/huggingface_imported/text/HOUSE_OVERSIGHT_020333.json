China shared (or exchanged) the fruits of its espionage on\nnuclear warhead design with North Korea, Pakistan, Iran and Russia.\n\nDespite its formidable intelligence coups in the US, the Chinese intelligence service managed to\nremain among the most elusive of America’s intelligence adversaries. Its espionage organizations\nare hidden behind layers of bureaucracy in the Ministry of State Security, Chinese Communist\nparty structures, and the second, third and fourth department of the General Staff of the People’s\nLiberation Army. Much of its cyber espionage units are concealed on the campuses of its\nuniversities. Its hierarchy, or order of battle, is also obscure. Few traces have been uncovered of\nany conventional espionage networks in the United States and no major Chinese spy has ever\nbeen arrested. Part of the reason that Chinese espionage has proved so elusive to the eyes of\nwestern counter-intelligence, was that, unlike Russia, it did not ordinarily rely on intelligence\nofficers in its embassies to recruit penetration agents to steal secrets. It did not even have an\nembassy in the United States during most of the Cold War. Instead, its services specialize it\nassembly mosaics of intelligence assembled from a wide variety of sources including non-classified\ndocuments, returning graduate students, scientific conferences, exchanges with allies, and a vast\noperation of hacking into computers, or cyber- espionage.\n\nCyber-espionage is indeed a vast enterprise in China. Graduating over 150,000 computer science\nengineers, it had no shortage of personnel. It also had developed the cyber tool kit to gain access to the\ncomputer networks of US government contractors and consultants in the private sector and government\nagencies, planting “sleeper” bugs in net-worked computers. Like human “sleeper” agents, these hidden\nprograms can be activated when needed for operational purposes. Chinese controllers can retrieve emails,\ndocuments and turn on the cameras and microphones of personal computers, tablets and smart phones. By\n2007, Paul Strassmann, a top US defense expert on cyber-espionage, reported that China had inserted\n“zombie” programs in some 700,000 computers in the US which could be used to mount cyber attack to\nretrieve emails from other computers. The Chinese service also reportedly penetrated companies that\nprovide Internet services, including Google Yahoo, Symantec, and Adobe, which allowed it to track emails\nand enclosures of individuals. With such an invisible army of zombie computers, it is not entirely\nsurprising that China finds little need to employ human: sleeper” agents.\n\nChinese cyber-specialists used this capability to hack into computers of outside contractors,\nincluding Booz Allen and other companies that supplied technologists to the NSA. It also had\nnotable successes in obtaining the dossiers of US employees and independent contractors at the\nNSA, CIA and other intelligence services. Its intrusions, as previously noted, into computer\nnetwork at the Office of Personnel Management traced back to 2009. Eventually, by 2015,\naccording to US estimates, the cyber attack had harvested over twenty million personnel files of\npast and present Federal government employees. In addition, it reaped in over 14 million\nbackground checks of intelligence workers done by the Federal Investigative Service. All the\nintelligence workers with a SCI clearance, such as Snowden, were required to provide in these\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020333",
