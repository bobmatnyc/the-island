  "text": "any warning, the next tactic 1s\ncompetitive devaluation, which risks a\nnew protectionism. \"Currency\nmanipulation\" could become a danger\nthat reaches far beyond the debate about\nChinese policies. The world economy\nwill need at some point to withdraw the\ndrug of cheap money and negative real\ninterest rates. The U.S. should anticipate\nthese dangers.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund also\ncould help set standards about exchange-\nrate policies and serve as a referee that\nblows a whistle, even if it cannot\npenalize. The IMF and the World Trade\nOrganization should anticipate this risk\nand give effect to the existing WTO\nagreement that economies must \"avoid\nmanipulating exchange rates . . . to gain\nan unfair competitive advantage.\"\n\nThird, the U.S. needs to break the logjam\non opening markets. As the leading world\neconomy, America should initially try to\nstrengthen and increase international\ntrade through the WTO. As my\ncolleagues at the Peterson Institute have\npointed out, there are gains from the\nstymied Doha Round of trade\nnegotiations that should be harvested\nnow: ending agricultural export\nsubsidies; limiting food export controls;\neliminating tariffs and quotas for almost\nall exports of the poorest countries;\nfacilitating customs and clearance\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029738",
