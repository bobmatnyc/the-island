Epstein’s\n\nhome on El Brillo Way is five miles to the east. Mary’s high\n\n\" school is several miles to the west.\nIt's fitting, somehow, that this jail—which is the jail Epstein\n'ends up in, after turning himself in to the local sheriff—lies in\n7 between the two points.\nThe detention center’s inmates, their families, and their law-\ners call it the Gun Club, a reference not only to the jail’s address,\non Gun Club Road, but also to its population of hustlers, bur-\nglars, drug dealers, rapists, and murderers. There’s the occa-\nsional hooker as well. And, from time to time, Haitian refugees\nfe lodged there.\nThere are three thousand inmates in all.\n\ni‘\n\n4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022007",
