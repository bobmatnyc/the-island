representing POTUS and know what to do when potus lies to u.

My world thinks poorly of Gorelick for representing Jared.
How guilty is Donald?

Of crudity surely

Of gross ignorance surely

Of being utterly without the intellect temperament for job surely

Of being over line on family profiting very likely

Of gross disregard for appearances almost surely.

Of Russians having financial leverage. Less clear

Of Russians helping in. Election w complicity of his campaign plausible but not certain

Strikes me if u work for Donald u don't free lance so he is guilty of whatever his campaign did.
Do u agree w foregoing?
