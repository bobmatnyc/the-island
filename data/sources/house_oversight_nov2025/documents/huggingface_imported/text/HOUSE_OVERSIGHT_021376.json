Masi, M.D.,\nPh.D., an assistant professor in the Department\nof Medicine at the University of Chicago. He is\nco-founder of Every Block A Village Online, an\nInternet-based community development\nprogram, and is past president of the Illinois\nchapter of Physicians for a National Health\nProgram. He is the current president of the\nMidwest Society of General Internal Medicine\nand has received numerous awards, including a\nModels That Work Award from the United\nStates Bureau of Primary Health Care and the\nNew Investigator Health Sciences Research\nAward from the Gerontological Society of\nAmerica. With a medical degree, as well as a\nPhD in social service administration, Dr. Masi’s\nresearch focuses on the socioeconomic factors\nunderlying health disparities. He currently has\ntwo projects, one aimed at developing an\nintervention to reduce loneliness and one focused\non the role of sex hormones in gender, age, and\nracial differences in cardiovascular disease. He\nis a reviewer for several scientific journals and\ngrant-making organizations and has published\nresearch and reviews on diverse topics, including\nhealth insurance reform and racial disparities in\nbreast cancer and hypertension.\n\nHuman capacity for creativity,\ncompassion, and learning is unparalleled in the\nanimal kingdom. However, humans reach their\nfull potential only when they are socially\nengaged. Lack of social engagement impairs\ncreativity and learning, and limits opportunities\nfor caregiving and emotional growth. Numerous\nstudies have shown that loneliness is also a risk\nfactor for illness and premature mortality.\nBecause loneliness is increasing in modern\nsociety, it is critically important to understand\nthis condition, as well as strategies to reduce it.\nThis essay describes our review of the literature\nregarding loneliness reduction interventions.\n\nPage |130\n\nThe 17\" century English\nphilosopher Thomas Hobbes proposed\nthat without the organizing structure of\ngovernment, humans would experience\nbellum omnimum contra omnes (war of\nall against all) and life would be\n“solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and\nshort”(1). While this colorful description\nis often quoted, less attention is paid to\nHobbes’ premise that such misery can be\navoided if humans codify and enforce\nthe rules of a civil society. Not everyone\nagrees with Hobbes’ views, but history\nis replete with examples of human\nmisery when anarchy reigns and of\nrelative peace when a social contract is\nobserved. A question that philosophers\ncontinue to debate is whether\ncollaboration for mutual benefit is part\nof human nature or whether promotion\nof the self above all others is man’s\nprimary motivation. In this volume,\nCacioppo argues that sociality is an\nintegral part of human nature. He notes\nthat given each child’s prolonged period\nof total dependence, survival into child-\nbearing age depends entirely upon the\nsupport and protection of adults, most\noften parents or kin. As a result, those\nwho survive long enough to procreate\npass along genes for nurturing and\nprotection, thereby hardwiring a form of\nsociality into our genetic code.\n\nThis protective behavior helps\nensure that genes within a family are\npassed on to future generations.\nCooperation among unrelated adults or\nthe support and protection of children by\nadults exists beyond kin, as well,\nbecause these activities also provide\nsurvival benefit. Examples from early\nhuman existence include hunting and\ngathering, which are more likely to\nsucceed when pursued as a group than\nindividually. To these structural benefits\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021376",
