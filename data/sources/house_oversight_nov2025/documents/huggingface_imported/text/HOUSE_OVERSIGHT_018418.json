  "text": "hundred years of dominance starting in the 16\" century. The Romans managed\ncenturies of Mediterranean control .\n\nThe secret of those long-running orders was something that will be familiar now:\nEach possessed tools of power which permitted assembly of empire at an unusually\nlow cost in lives and gold and effort. Kauffman and his colleagues, as they\nconsidered the results of their survey, noticed each long-lived empire pioneered an\nadministrative design that embodied an efficiency much like that of our own\nnetwork dynamics. The addition of new territories brought more that they cost to\nmasters of long imperial orders. Like new users on a social network, or Baran’s fish-\nnets, they married easy expansion and high returns. “Rome rose because it\ncombined the strengths of traditional Republican institutions with innovations that\ngave it a unique capacity for inclusion of foreigners,” they explain. “Magadha was the\nmost administratively durable of the ancient Indian states; and Qin, with the self-\nstrengthening reforms of Shang Yang - economic reforms and military conscription\nas well as bureaucratic innovations - developed the most penetrating and brutally\neffective state structure in its international system.” The Incas, the Han, and nearly\nevery long-standing empires glistened with this attractive logic. The secret to\nhegemony, to avoiding a violent power shifts every few decades, is a structure that\ngrows without additional, destructive costs. When Machiavelli coldly called Rome a\n“republic for expansion”, this was what he had in mind. Enduring empires have been\nengineered, like a modern network, for growth and prosperity.\n\nIt’s too early for us to know if this logic will obtain in our age. But networks evolve,\nas we've seen, to what makes them most efficient. They crave speed and growth.\nAnd this means they want cooperation; it’s the essential fuel for co-evolution. The\ntraditional view of the international system as anarchic is not wrong, but we've seen\nhow when you snap any object into a network system it begins to crave a kind of\nhierarchy. Networks change power balances. National fury and rebellious twitches\nand competition will, of course, be a part of the transition ahead. But as we look\nback at the industrial tools that matured and spun up the world to a war in the last\ncentury, we can see how they they were designed in a sense for direct collision.\nMassive industrial armies wrestled in symmetrical power battles. Network power\nhums differently. The design logic of linked systems means they function poorly\nwhen tuned for simple brutality. It’s why the tools for our new world are so\ndangerous in the hands of those who don't understand what they are capable of, and\nwhat they demand. We should remain fixed on what might emerge as a future state,\nand on avoiding the shaking dangers of the route. It is from that posture that we can\nbegin to consider the most essential and interesting and profitable questions. The\nmost profound is probably this one: We’ve seen now what it feels like to use the\nSeventh Sense to contemplate the networks around us and to examine the global\nsystem with its risks and opportunities in a new way. But what do we discover\nwhen, as if we were looking into a mirror for the very first time, we use this\npowerful new sensitivity to examine ourselves?\n\n186\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018418",
