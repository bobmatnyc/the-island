  "text": "people.”\n\nI'm glad that my mother feels good about life today, and I myself don't have the urge to\ntrack those guys down and rend them limb from limb. (Much.) Yet I wonder if the men\nwho attacked her ever think about what they did. I wonder if the ex-boyfriend ever\nunderstood how thoroughly he brutalized someone he claimed to love, or how male\nprivilege played a role in his actions. These days, I write a lot about masculinity, and I try\nto understand men's perspective on gender issues. Writing about men and gender is tricky\nterritory, though. What if I end up shoring up the entitlement that led that those assholes\nto attack my mom?\n\nMom told me that she Googled her rapist ex-boyfriend. He has three daughters. She\nwonders whether he ever thinks about it, too.\n\nNaturally, I also think a lot about feminism, and how we can make it both effective and\nwelcoming. What does it mean when people call it a movement that \"eats its young\"?\nWhat does it mean that feminism has become so tied up in identity? What does it mean\nwhen a rape survivor who had a career and raised a feminist daughter won't call herself a\nfeminist? What does it mean that taking on the \"feminist\" label means taking on a host of\nother associations -- associations that even women like my mother are unwilling to\naccept?\n\nKK ok\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/05/25/my-moms-rape-story-and-a-confused-\nrelationship-with-feminism/\n\nSection 3 Study Guide\n\nHaving established the building blocks of Section 1, and the extra perspectives of Section\n2, this section was intended to pull together some seriously multi-layered syntheses.\n\nTK OK ok\n\n1. Is it hard to relate BDSM theory and practice to feminism or anti-rape activism? If so,\nthen how is it hard? If not, then why do some people believe that there are difficulties?\n\nKOK ok\n\n2. Which issues of sexuality do you feel clear about, and which do you feel foggy or\nuncertain about? How and why?\n\n2a. Do you have a sense of what makes you feel strong and centered in your sexuality and\nrelationships? If so, how do you go about establishing those factors in your life?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018683",
