  "text": "Under the simplifying assumptions of the life cycle model adapted from Ben-Porath,\n\nwe would meet that deadline by directing all adult gross realized output less\n\nproperty plowback p(k), to gift to the immediate generation of young received as\n\ntheir invested consumption. The young would add their part by compounding that\noutside investment into their human capital at the rate of their entire ex ante output.\nThis would prove the most straightforward strategy to exhaust and replace all total\ncapital by the deadline exactly. This is just as in my adjusted Ben-Porath model with\nthe addition of the specified deadline.\n\nHere as there, I describe adults collectively and the young collectively. | will not\nattempt to model effects of kin selection in individual investment choices. But I have\nintended to lay a groundwork. Investment, in Hamilton’s sense, translates to gift y,\nin economic terms. It is a flow of total capital (fitness) from donor to donee. At the\nindividual scale, as well as for the group scale, it equals gross realized output less\nplowback. Gross realized output tends to be a continuous flow, as we see in pay,\nrather than one easily sped up or slowed down. This gives an idea of the time\n\nconstraints I mentioned in critiquing Hamilton’s rule.\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 28\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011154",
