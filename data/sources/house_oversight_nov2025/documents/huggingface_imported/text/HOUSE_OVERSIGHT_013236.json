Bottom: representation of the same\nrule in the Atomspace as cognitive content, susceptible to analysis and improvement by the\nsystem’s own cognitive processes.\n\nFurthermore, we suspect that the internal representation of programs used for supercompila-\ntion is highly relevant for other kinds of self-modification as well. Supercompilation requires one\nkind of reasoning on complex programs, and goal-directed program creation requires another,\nbut both, we conjecture, can benefit from the same way of looking at programs.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013236",
