  "text": "Then, from directly behind me, came another sound: the hiss of Avi’s bulky\ntwo-way radio. I was worried we’d end up waking the Syrians. But just as I was\nfiguring out how to make sure we got past them before that happened, Avi drew\nup beside me.\n\n“Ehud,” he whispered. “It’s 1:15. The command post ordered us to turn\nback.”\n\n“Turn off the radio,” I said, my hand on his elbow, reassuringly I hoped, as I\nled him and the others back a full 100 feet from the Syrians. We took a wider\nroute around the camp. We moved much more quickly on the final mile to the\nroad that led toward Quneitra. We were now well clear of the camp, and I felt it\nwas unlikely we’d run into a patrol. I was also confident we’d have an easier\nreturn trip. I knew what had held us up on the way in: finding a path on the\nplateau clear of mines, figuring out how to cross the river, and the general\nunfamiliarity of the terrain. None of those applied now. I felt we could get the\nbugging job done and still be back before dawn. As we got nearer the road, Avi\nasked me a couple of more times whether he should turn the radio back on.\n“No,” I kept telling him. “It’s OK. Pl tell you when.”\n\nIt was about two in the morning when we reached the road. We found a\ntelephone pole set back on the edge of a field. Moshiko hoisted himself onto\nKuti Sharabi’s shoulders, clambered up the pole and installed the bugging\ndevice. The entire operation took him less than 10 minutes. We moved more\nquickly on the way back. By around 3:30, we had crossed the river. “You can\nturn on the radio now,” I told Avi, who was obviously relieved. He handed it to\nme. Using our agreed code words, I reported our location, and added the phrase\nfor “mission accomplished.”\n\nWhen we began our final descent, it was starting to get light. I assumed we\nwere near enough to the border to make it unlikely we’d be shot at. Still, there\nwas a danger we’d be spotted by a patrol, so I was relieved when we reached the\nmound of boulders, more than ten feet high, that served as a tank barrier outside\nKibbutz Dan. When we stepped behind it, I saw that not only Avraham, but\nMeir Amit as well, were waiting. The Head of Military Intelligence said\nnothing. He didn’t have to. He just shook my hand, beaming. Avraham grabbed\neach of us, one by one, in a bear hug.\n\nThen, drawing me aside, Avraham said that I had only narrowly missed\nlanding in deep trouble. I assumed my transgression was shutting off the radio\nand disobeying the order to return. That was just part of the problem, however.\n\n70\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011541",
