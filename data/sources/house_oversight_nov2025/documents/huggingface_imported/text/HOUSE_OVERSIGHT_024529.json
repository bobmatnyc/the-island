For more information, see the discussion below under the heading ‘“— Long Term Incentive Plan.”\nLong Term Incentive Plan\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA projections do not include the effect of any payments that may be made pursuant to\nour Long Term Incentive Compensation Plan. Under this new plan, which provides performance-based\nincentive compensation awards beginning in 2006 based on our performance against specific Adjusted\nEBITDA targets, we will accrue expenses ranging from $2.6 million in 2006 to $15.2 million in 2011 if our\nAdjusted EBITDA meets the projections set forth in this Memorandum. Each award is payable at the end\nof three years based on performance and subject to continued employment (with certain exceptions).\nThe accrued expenses associated with an award in each period are non-cash, subject to cash settlement\nwhen and if the award for that period is earned at the end of the third year. The actual expenses could be\nhigher or lower depending on whether actual Adjusted EBITDA performance exceeds or is less than the\namounts projected herein.\n\nWorking Capital\n\nKLC OpCo does not expect revenue or expenses to have a meaningful impact on working capital ratios in\nthe future.\n\n96\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024529",
