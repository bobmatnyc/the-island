  "text": "Of all the professional newscasters | have met, Walter Cronkite of\nCBS was the most charming. He treated me with respect and dignity. After\nthe broadcast interview, we sat in his anteroom and talked informally.\n\n“I’ ve always wanted to thank you,” he said, “for inadvertently\nbringing me back to sanity that horrible weekend John Kennedy was\nkilled.”\n\n“Oh, really—how so?”\n\n“This followed on the heels of the televised shooting of Lee Harvey\nOswald by Jack Ruby. A journalist asked for your reaction, and you replied\nwith a slip of the tongue, ‘Two rights don’ t make a wrong.’ Before you\ncould correct yourself, | was finally able to break through my depression\nwith a bit of laughter.”\n\n“Yes, those were muddled times. Do you know | forgot where | was\nthe day the assassination took place? | had to tell the FBI | couldn’ t\nremember, and it was not until later that | remembered | had been in\nDallas, of all places. There was a convention of the American Bottlers of\nCarbonated Beverages, and | was there representing Pepsi-Cola. But | flew\nout of there at eleven o’ clock that morning. Kennedy was shot around\n\none o’ clock, as | recall. Where were you that day?”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015102",
