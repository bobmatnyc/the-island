  "text": "Trashing the Right to Read\n\nBefore Kenneth Foster’ s death sentence was revoked at the last\nminute in August 2007, he had read a book, We/come to the Terrordome,\nand he wrote a letter to the author, Dave Zirin:\n| have never had the opportunity to view sports in this way. And as | went\nthrough these revelations | began to have epiphanies about the way sports\nhave a similar existence in prison. The similarities shook me. Facing\nexecution, the only thing that | began to get obsessive about was how to\nget heard and be free, and as the saying goes, you can’ t serve two gods.\nSports, as you know, becomes a way of life. You monitor it, you almost\ncome to breathe it. Sports becomes a way of life in prison, because it\nbecomes a way of survival. For men that don’ t have family or friends to\nhelp them financially, it becomes a way to occupy your time. That’ s\nanother sad story in itself, but it’ s the root to many men’ s obsession\nwith sports.\n\nZirin writes, “It didn’ t matter if he was on death row or Park\nAvenue, | felt smarter having read his words. But even more satisfying was\nthe thought that thinking about sports took his mind--for a moment--\naway from his imminent death, the 11-year-old daughter he will never\ntouch, and the words he will never write. | thought sending him my first\n\nbook, What’ s My Name, Fool?: Sports and Resistance in the U.S., would\n\nbe a good follow-up.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015282",
