  "text": "leaving the stage, Pearl called out, “Vice dick!” | was fully dressed, but it\ndidn’ t matter. This was a perfect example of tit for tat. Or dick for tit.\n\nMy old friend Steve Gaskin and | were staying at a bed-and-\nbreakfast house where there were angels all over the place. Stuffed angels,\nplastic angels, plaster-of-paris angels, embroidered angels, stained-glass\nangels, paplier-mache’ angels, teddy-bear angels and origami angels.\nThere were angel dolls and angel paintings and angel sculptures and even\nan angel mobile hanging from the ceiling. In the bathroom, there was an\nangel tissue-dispenser and an angel night-light. On a table in the hallway,\nthere was a pile of Ange/s on Earth magazine. On the bureau in my room,\nthere was a copy of Whispers From Heaven, featuring such articles as\n\n“Feeding Angels,” “When Angels Kiss\" and “Rescued by Angels: The\nAmazing Story of a Kidnapping Survivor.”\n\nGaskin’ s room had a door that led to the roof, and the first night\nwe sat out there and smoked a joint. The next day there was a note taped\nto the door: “The roof is to be used only as a fire escape. Please use the\npatio.” The next night we smoked a joint in my room. And the next day\nthere was a “No Smoking” sign on the inside of my door, and the\n\nelectric fan was on, aimed toward the now-open window.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015224",
