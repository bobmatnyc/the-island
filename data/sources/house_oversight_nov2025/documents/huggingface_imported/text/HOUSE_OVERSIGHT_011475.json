  "text": "should, offer in search of a true peace with the Palestinians. I was the one who\nwould be blamed by the inevitable critics, whether for going too far or not far\nenough, or simply for the fact the deal had eluded us. I knew the drill: the same\nthing had happened when I had come tantalizingly close to finalizing a peace\ndeal with Syria’s then-dying dictator, Hafez al-Assad, a few months earlier. Yet\nthese three dedicated men — Gili, who was by training a lawyer; Shlomo, an\nacademic; and Danny, a former Mossad chief — had just been through dozens of\nhours of intricately detailed talks with each of Arafat’s top negotiators at Camp\nDavid, not to mention the dozens of other meetings before we had even got\nthere. Now they had to accept that, even with the lid of the pressure cooker\nbolted down tight, we had fallen short of getting the peace agreement which\neach of us knew had been within touching distance.\n\nI don’t think that even they could be described as depressed. On our side,\nafter all, we knew we had given ground on every issue we possibly could,\nwithout facing full-scale political rebellion at home. We had proposed an Israeli\npullout from nearly all of the West Bank and Gaza. A support mechanism for\nhelping compensate tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees from the serial\nArab-Israeli conflicts of the past half-century. And most painfully and\ncontroversially — my rivals and critics back home were already accusing me of\n“treachery” — we had agreed to let President Clinton present a proposal for the\nPalestinians to get sovereignty over the Arab neighbourhoods of Jerusalem as\nwell as “custodial sovereignty” over the Haram al-Sharif, the mosque complex\nperched above the Western Wall, the holiest site in Judaism.\n\nBut precisely because we had been ready to offer so much, only for Arafat to\nreject it all, even as a basis for talks on a final deal, I could sense how gutted my\nkey negotiators were feeling.\n\nStill, I’m sure none of them was surprised when my own old operational\ninstincts kicked in. In my statement to journalists, I had been careful to say that\nArafat was not ready at this time to make the historic compromises needed for\npeace. But before parting with President Clinton and Secretary Albright, I’d\nbeen more forthright. It was clear, without my saying so, that the chances of our\ngetting a peace agreement on Clinton’s watch were now pretty much over. He\nhad barely five months left in office. Yet my deeper fear was that with Arafat\nhaving brushed aside an offer that went far further than any other Israeli had\nproposed — far further than the Americans, themselves, had expected from Israel\n— the prospects for peace would be set back for years. Perhaps, I said, for two\ndecades.\n\n4\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011475",
