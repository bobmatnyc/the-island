  "text": "psychology to (at least momentary)\nconsideration of a career in government\nservice. A student with the long-held\nintent of becoming a researcher and with\nno interest in politics, government, or\npublic service might seem to be an\nimmovable object. And yet, in that\nmoment, Jordan’s speech had sufficient\nimpact to make government service\nseem like the only path one would want\nto take or should ever consider.\n\nAlthough her points were argued\nwell, the impact of Jordan’s speech was\nnot simply rhetorical. John F.\nKennedy’s “Ask not what your country\ncan do for you....” and Martin Luther\nKing, Jr.’s “I have a dream....” affected\nlisteners deeply well beyond the\ncognitive strengths of a good argument.\nMoreover, while all these speeches were\ndelivered beautifully and from the heart,\nit is not the performance of these\nspeeches alone that can move listeners to\nact on behalf of others. The\nperformance alone cannot give substance\nto an empty message. While there are\ncases in which a great performance may\nsuggest briefly that there was content of\nimport even in the absence of a real\nmessage, it is more likely the\nconjunction of message and delivery that\nmoves people. In these speeches is a\nclear demonstration of the power of\nlanguage. Language is more than words\nand more than delivery. Indeed, Cicero,\nin De Oratore, said that rhetoric conveys\ninformation, persuades listeners, and\nevokes emotion.\n\n“In the beginning was the word....”\n\nIf “the word made flesh” is taken\nmetaphorically, the power of language\ncan be made visceral in sermons.\nConsider the power of Jonathan\nEdwards’ sermon, which Clark Gilpin’s\nchapter discusses, to terrify a\n\nPage | 67\n\ncongregation, to wrench them from\ncomplacency with images of torment. A\nsermon delivers a message, but it can do\nso in calm tones of instruction or with\nfire and brimstone. The choice and\npoetry of words and the cadence and\nintonation of speaking can draw the\nlistener in slowly or seize the listener\nsuddenly, the very sounds of speech\npainting images in the mind while\nigniting new inferences with literal and\nmetaphoric descriptions.\n\nIn the realm of the spiritual, there\nare few corporeal manifestations that can\nbe perceived directly. Neither heaven\nnor hell, neither God nor the Devil can\nbe seen or heard or touched. Preaching\nis needed to spell out the work of unseen\nhands and will and illuminate the power\nof the unseen. The force of that which is\nnot seen can only be felt when\ntransmitted directly through speech.\n\nIn Phaedrus, Plato described\nrhetoric as the art of leading the soul.\nThus it is not surprising that, while at the\ncore of religion is a collection of beliefs\nand concepts and canons, the fabric and\nform of religion is language. Symbols\nand icons are certainly important, but\nlanguage is the medium through which\nthe force of theology is actualized in\nprayers, benedictions, sermons, and\nteaching. Language can reach across\ntime and space to change minds,\nfeelings, and behavior, encoding laws\nand beliefs and presenting them with a\nconcrete reality in the here and now.\nThis is one kind of impact from author to\naudience in which a kind of connection\nis constructed bridging minds.\n\nAt the same time, in religious\npractices, another kind of connection is\nformed within a congregation. Joint\nrecitation, responsive reading, collective\nlistening, and understanding may serve\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021313",
