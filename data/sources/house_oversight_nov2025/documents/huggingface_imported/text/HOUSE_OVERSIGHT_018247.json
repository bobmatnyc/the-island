It was a poetic end. He had\nbeen, like so many of the Generals who would tumble before Napoleon in coming\nyears, absolutely blind to forces perfectly clear and visible and usable to the\nrevolutionary upstart. Napoloen’s European opponents would come to fear and\nadmire nothing so much as the Emperor’s specific, almosty mystical sort of\nbattlefield vision. He could look at a battlefield and see possibilities - certanties, in\nfact - that eluded older, famous men. They named his masterful insight the “Coup\nd’Oeil”: an instant, apprehending glimpse of power waves®. He saw forces and facts\nin war that were obscured from his enemies by their own habits of mind and the\nlimits of their creativity. The great Prussian military strategist Carl Von Clausewitz,\nwho was made prisoner by Napoleon during the massacre at Jena, used his time\nlocked up to begin compiling notes for his classic work of Western strategy, On War.\n“Genius,” he later wrote, “rises above the rules.” Mastery of strategy, Von Clausewitz\nexplained, was not merely the result of steely courage, geometric calculation or even\nluck, as earlier writers had figured it. Rather, it was derived from the ownership of a\nsensibility that could discern the secretly running lines of power that made the old\nways instantly irrelevant and appallingly dangerous.\n\nHistorians who mark out and consider the really long, century by century movement\nof humanity, often divide time into “historic” eras where fundamental, tsunami-like\nchanges wipe clean old orders and other, more sedate periods where time dawdles\nlike a quiet lake. This is the difference between living in Warsaw in, say, 1339 or\n1939. The first period was sober and silent; the second was awfully awake. Historic\nmoments like 1939 are marked by the fact that change comes to find you. It is often\nunavoidable. Your children are pulled into a World War. Your village is torn down.\nYour health is remade by science. The paleontologist Stephen Jay Gould called the\nmarch of these snapping changes “punctuated equilibrium,” as the world is jumped\nfrom one state to another - and never turns back. He was largely considering the\nextinction of the dinosaurs, but we find the idea useful in thinking about history too.\nThe Revolution of 1789 in France, for instance, which enabled the massive,\nvolunteer armies Napoleon later brought to his wars, which were of unprecedented\nsize. “Looking at the situation in this conventional manner, people at first expected\nto have to deal only with a seriously weakened French army,” Von Clausewitz\nexplained later. “But in 1793 a force appeared that beggared all imagination.”” The\n\n5 An interlocking set of gears: David Chandler, The Campaigns of Napoleon (New\nYork: Macmillan Publishing, 1974), 464; For a discussion of this generational\nmismatch, see the essay “HJ: MA SC1K EO eT AK EE SOY 2 or Dai Xu,\n“Reconsidering the military aspect of great power rise and fall from a cultural\nperspective” PLA Daily, June 8, 2015\n\n6 They named his masterful insight: Carl von Clausewitz, Howard, Michael, trans.\nClausewitz On War, (Washington: Library of Congress, 1998) 102\n\n7 But in 1793: On War, p 591 (1984)\n\n15\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018247",
