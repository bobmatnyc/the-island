  "text": "Tax Risks\n\nCertain tax risks relating to an investment in the Fund are discussed in Section XI “Certain Tax\n& ERISA Considerations”, which prospective investors should read carefully. No assurances\ncan be given that current tax laws, rulings and regulation will not be changed during the life of\nthe Fund. Prospective Limited Partners should consult their tax advisors for further\ninformation about the tax consequences of purchasing a Limited Partner Interest in the Fund.\n\nWithholding and Other Taxes\n\nThe General Partner intends to structure the Fund’s investments in a manner that is intended to\nachieve the Fund’s investment objectives and, notwithstanding anything contained herein to the\ncontrary, there can be no assurance that the structure of any investment will be tax efficient for\nany particular investor or that any particular tax result will be achieved. In addition, tax\nreporting requirements may be imposed on investors under the laws of the jurisdictions in\nwhich investors are liable to taxation or in which the Fund makes portfolio investments.\nProspective investors should consult their own professional advisors with respect to the tax\nconsequences to them of an investment in the Fund under the laws of the jurisdiction in which\nthey are liable to taxation. Furthermore, the Fund’s returns in respect of its investments may be\nreduced by withholding or other taxes imposed by jurisdictions in which the Fund’s portfolio\ncompanies are organized.\n\nConfidential Information\n\nThe Partnership Agreement will contain confidentiality provisions intended to protect\nproprietary and other information relating to the Fund and the Fund’s portfolio companies. To\nthe extent that such information is publicly disclosed, competitors of the Fund and/or\ncompetitors of its portfolio companies, and others, may benefit from such information, thereby\nadversely affecting the Fund, its portfolio companies and the General Partner and the economic\ninterests of Limited Partners.\n\nWritten Agreements\n\nThe Fund, the General Partner and the Management Company will be authorized, without the\napproval of any Limited Partner, to enter into side letters or similar written agreements with\nLimited Partners that have the effect of establishing rights under, or altering or supplementing\nthe terms of this Memorandum, the Partnership Agreement, such Limited Partner’s\nSubscription Agreement or other related agreements. The ability of other Limited Partners to\nreceive copies of and/or elect to receive the benefit of such side agreements will be limited.\n\nMarket volatility\n\nSince 2008, the capital, credit and securities markets have been experiencing unprecedented\nlevels of volatility and disruption. Ongoing volatility could negatively impact the Fund in a\nnumber of ways. Many of the investments purchased, held and sold on behalf of the Fund may\nbe complex, and their market values will be highly sensitive to market changes. Overall Fund\nreturns may be reduced as relatively small changes in the capital, credit or securities markets\nmay have significant impacts on the profitability of Fund investments. In addition, the U.S.\nCongress and regulatory agencies may adopt new financial regulations and tax policies in\nresponse to continued volatility, which could restrict the Fund’s investment options and be\notherwise unfavorable to the Fund.\n\n70 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024081",
