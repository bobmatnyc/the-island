  "text": "UK equities\n\nPreference: neutral\n\nFTSE 100 (24 Oct): 5,805 (last publication: 5,768)\nUBS View FTSE 100 (6-month target): 5,850\n¢ We keep our neutral stance on UK equities. Earnings have continued to disappoint, showing one of the\nweakest dynamics within our market universe. Commodity related sectors show steep earnings declines,\nwhich is expected to moderate only in a lagged fashion to stabilizing commodity prices. The Healthcare\nsector suffers from company specific issues which affect earnings also negatively.\n¢ With the oil price expected to trade down over the next 3 months, earnings of companies in the energy\nsector - comprising about 20% of the market — should remain depressed over the coming quarters. Within\nfinancials, law suits related to mis-selling of insurance related products represent a special risk factor.\ne Recent strengthening of the British pound is also a headwind for the competitiveness of UK companies,\nas earnings measured in the local currency are negatively affected.\n¢ The PE of UK equities looks attractive at first sight. But over the past 10 years, UK equities traded on\naverage at a discount to global equities.\n\nA Positive scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 7,000\ne A fast strengthening in global growth and recovering demand from emerging markets leads to fast rising\ncommodity prices, helping the Energy and Materials sectors to lead the market higher. The market could\nre-rate to a P/E multiple of 13.0x, and we would expect earnings growth of 5-10% over 12 months.\n\n& Negative scenario FTSE 100 (6-month target): 4,750\n¢ A global recession drags UK earnings down by 15-20% over 12 months. The market's traditionally\ndefensive characteristics would only partly offset its strong exposure to commodity-related sectors. We\nwould expect the trailing P/E multiple to drop towards 10x.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're\nwatching\n\nWhy it matters\n\nGrowth indicators Business survey indicators provide information on economic development in the\n\nUK. Key date: 1 Nov, PMI manufacturing; 5 Nov, PMI services\nEnergy and Materials together comprise about 30% of the UK market according\n\nto market capitalization. Developments in commodity prices affect earnings\nestimates.\n\nCommodity prices\n\nPolicy action Loose monetary policy by the Bank of England supports equities. Key date:\n\n8 Nov, Bank of England policy meeting\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne The UK offers an attractive 4% dividend\nyield. We still like companies with high\nquality income streams.\n\ne We like Consumer Staples in the UK. The\nsector should provide steady earnings\ngrowth through its exposure to\nemerging markets.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne The UK market's close to 4% dividend\nyield provides a good income stream.\n\ne¢ Companies with pricing power are\nexpected to deliver superior earnings\ngrowth.\n\nUK market trades at a P/E discount,\nbased on realized earnings\n\n24\n\n2003 2006 2009 2012\n\n— FTSE 100: realized PIE MSCI World: realized PIE\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters, UBS, as of October 24, 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO asset class specialist Markus Irngartinger, markus.irngartinger@ubs.com 16\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025263",
