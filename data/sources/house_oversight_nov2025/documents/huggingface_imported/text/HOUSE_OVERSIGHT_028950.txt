That's ideal. Larry's away and I'll be working all day. I'm free any time.

Dear Jeffrey,

May | drop by before the New Year (perhaps on the 9th, or on the 17th or 18th?) to get your
advice about my renewal of the Templeton campaign, and also my needs in the coming year for
Poetry in America? Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the
bottom a message just for you....

-Lisa

That you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose
support— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to
realize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to
produce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of
humanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and
informal, online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to
begin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work.
