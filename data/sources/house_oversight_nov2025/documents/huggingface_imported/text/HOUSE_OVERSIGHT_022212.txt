Dems want Acosta out over Epstein case. GOP
seeking investigation. Then there's Matt Gaetz

By ALEX DAUGHERTY
McClatchy Washington Bureau

WASHINGTON — Democrats
are calling for Labor Secretary Alex
Acosta’s resignation. Republicans

support an inter-
nal investigation
into Acosta’ role
in a controversial
plea deal for mul-
timillionaire sex
abuser Jeffrey Ep-
stein in 2008.

But Florida
Rep. Matt Gaetz,
one of President
Donald = Trump's
biggest defenders
in Congress, is taking a different ap-
proach.

In an interview with the Miami Her-
ald this week, Gaetz said re-examining
Acosta’s handling of Epstein’ case,
which came under increased scrutiny
after the Herald's three-part series Per-
version of Justice, sets a “dangerous”
precedent for prosecutors, A federal
judge ruled last week that prosecutors
run by Acosta, then the U.S. attorney
for South Florida, broke the law when
they failed to inform Epstein’s under-
age victims of the plea agreement.
The judge gave federal prosecutors 15
days to confer with Epstein’s victims
and their attorneys to come up with a
resolution.

“T don't know what I don’t know
and certainly if there is ever an indi-
cation of misconduct, that has to be
thoroughly reviewed, but I think it’s a
dangerous thing to go back and sec-
ond-guess decisions that prosecutors

have to make in real time,” Gaetz said.
“Tm deeply troubled by Mr. Epstein’s
actions, I think that he certainly should
have faced a far stiffer consequence
than he did, but having tried cases I
know that it’s hard to go back and sort
of second-guess the risk analysis that
goes into putting witnesses before a
jury and subjecting them to cross-ex-
amination.”

In fact, the judge in the case, U.S.
District Judge Kenneth A. Marra, was
careful to say he was not questioning
the prosecution's authonty to sign a
non-prosecution agreement. However,
the judge said the U.S. attorney had
an obligation to consult with Epstein’s
victims under the Crime Victims’
Rights Act. Acosta’ deliberate deci-
sion not to do so — at the insistence
of Epstein’s legal team — violated that
law, rendering the outcome illegal,
Marra wrote in a 33-page order.

Gaetz’s stance is not shared by other
South Florida lawmakers, including
Republicans.

Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who

introduced Acosta at his confirmation
hearing, said he wants to see the results
ofan investigation into the Justice De-
partment’s internal decision-making
process about Epstein'’s plea deal be-
fore deciding on Acosta’s future.

“We'd love to have an investigation
that looks at all that intemal delibera-
tion and who knew what about this,
how they talk about it, how was this
decision ultimately made and what
papertrail is there about that decision-
making,” Rubio said. “Obviously,
newspaper reporting is important but
so is whatever facts the Justice Depart-
ment has in its possession.”

Sen. Rick Scott, Rubio's fellow
Republican, had a similar view, along
with Miami Republican Rep. Mario
Diaz-Balart. Both said Acosta doesn't

si s time, but want
the investigation to continue.

“We don't really know all the facts
yet so it ought tocome out,” Scott said.
“We need more information.”

Six of the seven Democrats in Con-
gress from Miami-Dade and Broward

have called on Acosta to resign, the
exception being Rep. Donna Shalala.

Shalala was part of a group of
Democrats who signed on to a letter
last week demanding the passage of a
bill that would allow the Department
of Justice's Inspector General to re-
view the conduct of attomeys within
Justice, a power it does not currently
have. Acosta was responsible for ne-
gotiating Epstein's agreement when
he pleaded guilty to two prostitution
charges in state court instead of facing
federal charges, even though he was
accused of sexually abusing dozens
of young girls in his Palm Beach man-
sion.

Four Democrats, Rep. Debbie
Wasserman Schultz, Rep. Debbie
Mucarsel-Powell, Rep. Lois Frankel
and Rep. Ted Deutch, signed on to
a letter calling for Trump to demand
Acosta’s resignation. Rep. Alcee
Hastings also said Acosta should go.

“T would think under the circum-
stances with such a hot lamp on it,
he'dbe better served to resign,” Hast-
ings said. Hastings, a federal judge
who was impeached and removed
from office on corruption allega-
tions before successfully running for
the House, said he had never seen a
plea agreement like Epstein’s during
his legal career.

Rep. Frederica Wilson went one
step further, saying Acosta should
be removed from office if he does
not resign.

“The ... manner in which he
handled the Epstein case clearly
demonstrates that he is not the right
person to serve as our nation’s la-
bor secretary,” the Democrat said in

a statement. “If he could not stand
up against Epstein’s white-shoe at-
torneys, he clearly is not qualified
to take on the networks of human
traffickers operating in the United
States and represent their victims.”

Gaetz, the outlier among those
interviewed, is important because
he is a key Trump ally who fre-
quently speaks with the president.
In his second term in Congress after
serving in the state House, Gactz
represents the views of the presi-
dent’s most fervent supporters and
attracts national attention for his
defense of the president's policies
and rhetoric.

Gaetz is currently the subject of
an inquiry by the Florida Bar after
posting a tweet that critics said ap-
peared to be threatening toward for-
mer Trump lawyer Michael Cohen.
The tweet, which was later deleted,
implied that Cohen had extramarital
relations and was posted the night
before the public hearing where Re-
publicans attempted to shred Cohen's
ry as he detailed his illegal
activities on behalf of the president.

Gaetz suggested that Acosta’s deci-
sion to cut a plea deal without the vic-
tims knowing could have been a move
to protect them.

“T don't know if this was the case in
this matter, but as the former criminal
justice chairman in Florida, I've seen
how a lot of these sexual violence cas-
es, the fragility of witnesses and the
willingness of witnesses can be a fac-
tor,” Gaetz said. “I'm not saying it was
here, I'm just saying that in these types
of cases it’s something that’s always on
the minds of prosecutors.”

Trying to portray Democrats as out of step
with ordinary Americans, Vice President Mike
Pence said in a speech Friday at the Conser-
vative Political Action Conference that the
choice in the next election is “between free-

dom and socialism, between personal respon-
sibility and government dependence.”

“The moment America becomes a socialist
country is the moment America ceases to be
America,” Pence told the crowd of conserva-

live activists.

Pence also took aim at “Medicare-for-all”
and the Green New Deal, policy proposals
prominent in the crowded Democratic contest
for the presidential nomination.
