“Deliciously creative...the variety astonishes...intellectual skyrockets of stunning brilliance. Nobody
in the world is doing what Edge is doing." Denis Dutton, ARTS & LETTERS DAILY

THE WORLD QUESTION CENTER

James Flynn has defined “shorthand abstractions" (Cor "“SHA'’s") as concepts drawn from science that have
become part of the language and make people smarter by providing widely applicable templates C"market",
"placebo", “random sample," "naturalistic fallacy," are a few of his examples). His idea is that the
abstraction is available as a single cognitive chunk which can be used as an element in thinking and
debate.

The Edge Question 2011
WHAT SCIENTIFIC CONCEPT WOULD IMPROVE EVERYBODY'S COGNITIVE TOOLKIT?

The term 'scientific"is to be understood in a broad sense as the most reliable way of gaining knowledge
about anything, whether it be the human spirit, the role of great people in history, or the structure of
DNA. A “scientific concept" may come from philosophy, logic, economics, jurisprudence, or other analytic
enterprises, as long as it is a rigorous conceptual tool that may be summed up succinctly (or “in a
phrase") but has broad application to understanding the world.

[Thanks to Steven Pinker for suggesting this year’s EDGE Question and to Daniel Kahneman for advice on
its presentation. ]
