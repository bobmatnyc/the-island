  "text": "Trump: That is true. That is true. Well, that — no, but that is true. Mentioned it quickly, not\nlike, you know, and I would certainly have thought that maybe you would’ve called the\noffice. But that’s okay. Pll speak to Kellyanne. I am a little surprised that she wouldn’t have\ntold me. In fact, she just walked in. [to Kellyanne] I’m talking to Bob Woodward. He said\nthat he told you.\n\nConway: Yes.\n\nTrump: About speaking to me. But you never told me. Why didn’t you tell me?\n\nConway: [inaudible].\n\nTrump: I would’ve been very happy to speak to him. All right, so what are you going to do?\nBW: Well ...\n\nTrump: So I have another bad book coming out. Big deal.\n\nBW: ... it goes on, and 1... What you can count on is that I’ve been very careful. And\nEvelyn, are you on?\n\nEMD: Yes.\n\nBW: Evelyn Duffy, who’s my assistant, Mr. President.\n\nTrump: Hello, Evelyn.\n\nBW: She transcribed all the tapes because, with permission, I taped people for hundreds of\nhours.\n\nTrump: Good.\n\nBW: And I think there’s nothing in this book that doesn’t come from a firsthand source. Is\nthat correct, Evelyn?\n\nEMD: I believe that’s —\nTrump: But are you naming names? Or do you just say sources?\nBW: Yeah, well, it names real incidents, so . ..\n\nTrump: No, but do you name sources? I mean, are you naming the people, or just say,\npeople have said?\n\nBW: I say, at 2:00 on this day, the following happened, and everyone who’s there, including\nyourself, is quoted. And I’m sorry I didn’t get to ask you about these . ..\n\nTrump: I mean, you do know I’m doing a great job for the country. You do know that\nNATO now is going to pay billions and billions of dollars more, as an example, than\nanybody thought possible, that other presidents were unable to get more? And it was heading\ndownward. You do know all of the things I’ve done and things that I’m doing? I’m in the\nprocess of making some of the greatest trade deals ever to be made. You do understand that\nstuff? I mean, I hope.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033319",
