As none of Jane Doe 4’s factual details relate to non-parties,\nthe Court finds it unnecessary to strike the portion of the Rule 21 Motion related to her\ncircumstances. Regarding the Declaration in support of Petitioners’ response to Mr.\nDershowitz’s motion to intervene (DE 291-1), the Court shall strike paragraphs 4, 5, 7, 11, 13,\n15, 19 through 53, and 59, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-parties. Regarding\nthe Declaration of Jane Doe 3 in support of the Rule 21 Motion (DE 310-1), the Court shall strike\nparagraphs 7 through 12, 16, 39, and 49, as they contain impertinent details regarding non-\nparties. Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof,\nshould Petitioners demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a\nmatter presented for the Court’s consideration.\n\nAs mentioned, Mr. Dershowitz moves to intervene “for the limited purposes of moving to\nstrike the outrageous and impertinent allegations made against him and requesting a show cause\norder to the attorneys that have made them.” (DE 282 at 1). As the Court has taken it upon itself\nto strike the impertinent factual details from the Rule 21 Motion and related filings, the Court\nconcludes that Mr. Derschowitz’s intervention in this case is unnecessary. Accordingly, his\n\nmotion to intervene will be denied as moot.’ Regarding whether a show cause order should\n\n* This also moots Mr. Dershowitz’s Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Reply in\nSupport of Motion for Limited Intervention. (DE 317). Denying Mr. Dershowitz’s motion to\nintervene also renders moot Petitioners’ motion (DE 292) to file a sealed document supporting its\nresponse to Mr. Dershowitz’s motion. It will accordingly be denied as moot, and DE 293 (the\nsealed response) will be stricken from the record.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014852",
