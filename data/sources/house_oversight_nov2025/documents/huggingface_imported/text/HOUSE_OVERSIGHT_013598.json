  "text": "a name of a brain place can describe, much less explain in the language of physical\nor physiological mechanism, a patient’s illogical thoughts, feelings of hopelessness,\nirrational rage or prayerful gratitude. There remains a wide gap between ideas\nabout the mechanisms of human symbolic processing and those involving the\nstructures and functions of neuronal components and their connectivities in the\nbrain, particularly when perceived as regionally segmented meat. Yet this report of\nProfessor Judd’s finger-pointing plastic brain ritual should not elicit surprise since\niconic manipulation is certainly not new to the practices of priesthood.\n\nIn contrast with neuropsychiatry’s behavioral attributions to brain parts as an\nexplanatory pantheon of mysterious doers, absent of mechanical specifics, the\nfields of physics turn to more abstract and general mathematical and statistical, so-\ncalled phenomenological laws, such as those of thermodynamics and statistical\nmechanics. The accounts of Feynman’s abstract and general thermodynamic\ndevelopment of conservation of energy as well as equilibrium thermodynamics\ndiscussed previously serve as relevant examples. These abstract models have\nbeen found to capture the behavior common to diverse physical systems involving\n(often still unknown) differing physical mechanisms. Consistency of description,\nreliability, weighs in before predictive validity, which, with maturation of the research\narea, gradually becomes detailed mechanistic understanding with the eventual goal\nbeing derivation from the first principles of physics. The painful truth is that that in\nspite of evocative claims made to the contrary in the 1990-2000 Decade of the\nBrain, this level of understanding at the interface of neurobiological hardware and\nsoftware remains unbreached. Some recent attempts are interesting.\n\nOne of the current research themes about real single neurons in real brains\n(in contrast with the silicon chip modules used in neural network computer\nsimulations), involve widely distributed neurons that discharge in temporal\nsynchrony. These phenomena have been described by Max Planck’s Wolf Singer,\nChristoff Koch of California Institute of Technology and Florida Atlantic University’s\nSteven Bressler and others with words such as synchronization, phase locking,\ncoherence and binding. Binding is an intuitively seductive word that premises that\n\ntwo, even widely spatially separated, brain regions that manifest neuronal signals of\n\n98\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013598",
