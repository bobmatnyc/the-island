  "text": "It’s true that some underage girls may have lied about their age, and some came to the house\nvoluntarily several times—although, according to Florida statutes, none of that has any bearing\non the criminality of the contact, particularly if the girl was 16 or younger. But what is\nparticularly disturbing about this case—judging by arrangements at the Palm Beach house—is\nthat Epstein, a billionaire hedge-fund manager, organized his life around this sexual compulsion\nin an open and methodical way that suggests he felt he was beyond the law.\n\n* Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe\n\n* Billionaire Pedophile Goes Free\n\nAccording to police who executed a search warrant, the house was decorated with large, framed\nphotos of nude young girls, and similar images were found stashed in an armoire and on the\ncomputers seized at the house (although police found only bare cables where other computers\nhad been). Some bathrooms were stocked with soap in the shape of sex organs, and various sex\ntoys, such as a “twin torpedo” vibrator and creams and lubricants available at erotic specialty\nshops, were stowed near the massage tables set up in several rooms upstairs.\n\nEpstein also enlisted his staff in the predatory activity, and four—Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross,\nLesley Groff, and Marcinkova—figured in the FBI investigation. The Non Prosecution\nAgreement stipulated that they would not be charged. According to police reports and swom\nstatements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties, worked to ensure that an\nappointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recruits.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who\nwas for many years Epstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\n\nSince his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more\nthan a dozen lawsuits brought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last\nweek, days before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will\nhardly dent Epstein's $2 billion net worth.\n\nThe victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the\nhouse chef often gave them a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn\nstatement that a maid named Lupita, who was a devout Catholic, wept when she complained to\nhim about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled towels and putting away the\nsex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of him with a\nyoung girl.\n\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on El Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being\nsentenced to more jail time than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s\nactivities. He was fired, he says, for inadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls\nwhen she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money. He saw an unfamiliar “beater” in\nthe driveway one evening and called 911. When he left Epstein’s employ, Rodriguez took away\nsome notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his own prosecution,\nand failed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department’s initial investigation.\n\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried\nto sell this “golden nugget”—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims’ civil suits.\n\n19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011930",
