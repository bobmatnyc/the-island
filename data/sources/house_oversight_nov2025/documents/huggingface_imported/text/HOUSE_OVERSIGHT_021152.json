  "text": "The next two weeks I was expected to be at Charlie’s beckon call, never\naloud to leave his side, even making me sleep in his bed from the second\nnight onwards. J never even got the chance to call T.J again. It was too\nmuch of a risk anyways. Thus pushing him further out of my memory,\ntoo afraid, of the emotional repercussions.\n\nOur typical routine was to wake up get showered and dressed and I\nwould put on my make-up while Charlie made his business calls for the\nday. We would leave the house mid-afternoon and run his errands do\nsome shopping, sometimes meeting his friends or business partners for\nlunch, none of the men he introduced me to seemed offended at his\nchoice of adolescent eye candy. They'd just continue to chat away as if it\nwas normal to be in public with his arms draped over a girl young enough\nto be his granddaughter, not too shy by giving me a flirty tap on my\nbottom or even try to kiss me.\n\nMy last night was no different from every other night. We went\nshopping that day and out for lunch alone. Later we headed to a club his\nfriend just launched and it was his grand opening that night. The club was\ncalled “Iguana Joe’s”. We met up with his friend and said our hellos.\nThey both seemed so excited about the club and Charlie was full of\ncompliments all around. The club did have a line out the door which\nlooked a mile long coming in, luckily we didn’t have to use the front\ndoor. Charlie returned from the bar with two giant long-island iced teas,\nwhich were his favorite drink to start with and then we just sat for a while\nwatching people dancing. Occasionally conversing about passing\nthoughts. We danced for a while having a few more drinks and after\nabout two hours, Charlie said he was ready to go home. What a daunting\ntime to look forward to, he always liked to have a brief sexual encounter\nbefore drifting off to sleep with my naked body intertwined between his\narms and legs.\n\nIt was bad enough to have to entertain him at every given second of the\nday but his grip on me was so stifling | felt so chocked I could hardly\nbreathe much less sleep. Eventually my over-worked mind would drift in-\nand-out of a restless sleep, but constantly on edge. I thought many of\nnights of escaping, but where would I go? Would one of Ron’s ever-so-\nconnected informants finds me and turns me into him to be disposed of\nfor good? I just prayed that I wouldn’t be another missing person to add\nto the list of girls found in the local ditches. I knew that’s where I was\nheaded if I screwed this up for Ron again.\n\nAs if my guardian angel was there the whole time listening to my\nsecret prayers, my rescue came the next morning with an abrupt bursting\nthrough the bedroom door at about six am. Charlie and I were still lying\nin bed together and his grip on me was still tight. The men dressed in all\nblack military gear had large guns and helmets on. It was so frightening\n\n15\n\n] Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004148\n\nat first. | couldn’t even comprehend what was happening so rapidly. 1\nthought Charlie could’ve been in some kind of trouble with a business\nfriend he had done wrong too, but then one of the men in black shouted\n“FBI this is a raid get down with your hands on you head’, in too much\nshock to move three of the men grabbed Charlie and threw him to the\nfloor and cuffed him. I sat up in bed with my sheets covering my naked\nbody and watched as they dragged Charlie from the room. Still\ncompletely nude he wasn’t even aloud to get dressed. Another agent had\nto come back in to the room to find him a pair of shorts. | could hear him\nscreaming at the top of his lungs all of the way outside He was screaming\nand the last thing I heard him yell was “If you say anything you know\nwho will find you!” I could hear more threats being yelled at me but I\ncouldn’t make out what it was that he was saying. | was in total confusion\nand couldn’t believe what was happening. There were so many uniformed\nagents I felt so small compared to all of them but they were all very kind\nand helped me out of bed allowing me to remain covered up with the bed\nsheets so I could get dressed. The first decency | had been showed in a\nlong time. It was an odd feeling to acknowledge. I knew the life I had\ncome accustomed to for the last six months was now over, and in so\nmany ways I was relieved but was also very nervous about what lay\nahead of me.\n\nI excused myself to the bathroom to put some clothes on. Not having\nanything half decent, like a normal pair of jeans and a t-shirt. The best |\ncould come up with was a metallic blue miniskirt and a tiny matching top\nthat fell just below my breasts, hardly clothing at all it was more like\nscraps of cloth. Putting my hair up in a tight bun with the scrunchie that\nheld my five hundred dollar bills I was led out of Charlie’s townhouse for\nthe very last time. Starting my life over...again, | wanted to leave behind\nmy every memory belonging to these horrid times. Only taking small\nsack containing my underwear, makeup bag, and journal with me.\n\nThe agents led me down the staircase and my last vision’s of Charlie\nwas bent over the hood of a police vehicle still screaming and\nhandcuffed. I-slipped into the backseat of the car and was driven to\nBroward County Police Station where the Federal Agents interviewed me\nabout my entire whereabouts for the last six months. I was so scared of\nwhat Ron would do if I told the agents what really happened but at the\nsame token I knew he’d most likely kill me anyways for being such a\nliability.\n\nOver the next few hours I sat down and told the agents how Ron’s\nbusiness worked and what I part I had to play to him. 1 was able to ask\nhow they found out | was at Charlie’s house and they informed me that I\nwas being followed all the way from Ocala, Florida where Ron had me\nstowed away for the last four months. T.J, my friend, called my parents\n\n16\n\n£1 Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFREOO4 149\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021152",
