  "text": "Film director Roman Polanski is not the only convicted pedophile to walk free this month and return to a\nlife of privilege. On Wednesday, hedge fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completes his one-year house\narrest in Palm Beach, which has been even less arduous than Polanski’s time at a Swiss ski chalet.\n\nWatch Jeffrey Epstein Storm Out of a Deposition When Asked About His Penis\n\nDuring Epstein’s term of “house arrest,” he made several trips each month to his New York home and\nhis private Caribbean island. In the earlier stage of his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a\nminor—13 months in the Palm Beach Stockade—he was allowed out to his office each day. Meanwhile,\nEpstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits brought by the underage girls who were recruited to\nperform “massages” at his Palm Beach mansion. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week,\ndays before a scheduled trial; each received well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent\nEpstein’s $2 billion net worth.\n\n* Conchita Sarnoff: Epstein Faces Sex Traffic Probe\n\n* The Billionaire Pedphile's Sex Den\n\nWith that, the known victims of Epstein’s sexual compulsion have been officially silenced, and the case\nagainst him is closed unless new ones come forward. According to banking sources, he has been moving\nassets out of the U.S. and may well follow Polanski into a luxurious exile.\n\nBut the question remains: Did Epstein’s wealth and social connections—former President Bill Clinton;\nPrince Andrew; former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak; New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson; and\nformer Treasury Secretary Larry Summers were just a few of the prominent passengers on his private\njets—allow him to receive only a slap on the wrist for crimes that carry a mandatory 20-year sentence?\nWas he able, with his limitless assets and heavy-hitting lawyers—Alan Dershowitz, Gerald Lefcourt,\nRoy Black, Kenneth Starr, Guy Lewis, and Martin Weinberger among them—to escape equal justice?\n\nEpstein Faces Sex-Traffic Probe\nhttp://www.thedailyb...obref=obnetwork\n\nThe Justice Department is investigating Jeffrey Epstein for child trafficking, The Daily Beast has\nlearned—and has widened the scope of its probe to include a famous modeling agency.\n\nHedge-fund manager Jeffrey Epstein completed his sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor last\nweek. But it appears his problems may not be over. Now The Daily Beast has learned that:\n\n* Federal investigators continue to investigate Epstein’s activities, to see whether there is evidence of\nchild trafficking—a far more serious charge than the two in his non-prosecution agreement, the\narrangement between Epstein and the Department of Justice allowing him to plead guilty to lower-level\nstate crimes. Trafficking can carry a 20-year sentence.\n\n¢ The FBI is also investigating Epstein’s friend Jean Luc Brunel, whose MC2 modeling agency appears\nto have been a source of girls from overseas who ended up on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nBecause Epstein’s predatory habits stretch back many years and involved dozens of young-looking girls,\nthere may well be more evidence to uncover.\n\nUnder the concept of double jeopardy, Epstein can no longer be prosecuted for any of the charges\n\ncovered by his non-prosecution agreement, in which he agreed to serve a short term of incarceration,\nfund the civil suits of named victims, and register as a sex offender. The victims who accepted cash\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022255",
