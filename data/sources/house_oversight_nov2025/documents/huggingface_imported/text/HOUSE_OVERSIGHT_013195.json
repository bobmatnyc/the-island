  "text": "Chapter 15\nEmergent Networks of Intelligence\n\n15.1 Introduction\n\nWhen one is involved with engineering an AGI system, one thinks a lot about the aspects of\nthe system one is explicitly building — what are the parts, how they fit together, how to test\nthey’re properly working, and so forth. And yet, these explicitly engineered aspects are only a\nfraction of what’s important in an AGI system. At least as critical are the emergent aspects —\nthe patterns that emerge once the system is up and running, interacting with the world and\nother agents, growing and developing and learning and self-modifying. SMEPH is one toolkit\nfor describing some of these emergent patterns, but it’s only a start.\n\nIn line with these general observations, most of this book will focus on the structures and\nprocesses that we have built, or intend to build, into the CogPrime system. But in a sense, these\nstructures and processes are not the crux of CogPrime’s intended intelligence. The purpose\nof these pre-programmed structures and processes is to give rise to emergent structures and\nprocesses, in the course of CogPrime’s interaction with the world and the other minds within\nit. We will return to this theme of emergence at several points in later chapters, e.g. in the\ndiscussion of map formation in Chapter 42 of Part 2.\n\nGiven the important of emergent structures — and specifically emergent network structures —\nfor intelligence, it’s fortunate the scientific community has already generated a lot of knowledge\nabout complex networks: both networks of physical or software elements, and networks of\norganization emergent from complex systems. As most of this knowledge has originated in\nfields other than AGI, or in pure mathematics, it tends to require some reinterpretation or\ntweaking to achieve maximal applicability in the AGI context; but we believe this effort will\nbecome increasingly worthwhile as the AGI field progresses, because network theory is likely\nto be very useful for describing the contents and interactions of AGI systems as they develop\nincreasing intelligence.\n\nIn this brief chapter we specifically focus on the emergence of certain large-scale network\nstructures in a CogPrime knowledge store, presenting heuristic arguments as to why these\nstructures can be expected to arise. We also comment on the way in which these emergent\nstructures are expected to guide cognitive processes, and give rise to emergent cognitive pro-\ncesses. The following chapter expands on this theme in a particular direction, exploring the\npossible emergence of structures characterizing inter-cognitive reflection.\n\n279\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013195",
