  "text": "This book will teach you the precise principles I have used to become the following:\n\ne » Princeton University guest lecturer in high-tech entrepreneurship\n\ne » First American in history to hold a Guinness World Record in\ntango\n\ne » Advisor to more than 30 world-record holders in professional and\nOlympic sports\n\ne » Wired magazine’s “Greatest Self-Promoter of 2008”\n\ne > National Chinese kickboxing champion\n\ne » Horseback archer (yabusame) in Nikko, Japan\n\ne > Political asylum researcher and activist\n\ne » MI'V breakdancer in Taiwan\n\ne > Hurling competitor in Ireland\n\ne » Actor on hit TV series in mainland China and Hong Kong (Human\nCargo)\n\nHow I got to this point is a tad less glamorous:\n\n1977 Born 6 weeks premature and given a 10% chance of living. I survive instead and grow so fat that\nI can’t roll onto my stomach. A muscular imbalance of the eyes makes me look in opposite directions,\nand my mother refers to me affectionately as “tuna fish.” So far so good.\n\n1983 Nearly fail kindergarten because I refuse to learn the alphabet. My teacher refuses to explain\nwhy I should learn it, opting instead for “I’m the teacher—that’s why.” I tell her that’s stupid and ask her\nto leave me alone so I can focus on drawing sharks. She sends me to the “bad table” instead and makes\nme eat a bar of soap. Disdain for authority begins.\n\n1991 My first job. Ah, the memories. I’m hired for minimum wage as the cleaner at an ice cream\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013809",
