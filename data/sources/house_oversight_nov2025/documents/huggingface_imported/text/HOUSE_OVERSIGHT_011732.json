  "text": "from the massacre was that the mix of Jewish settlers, some of whom felt they\nwere on a messianic mission to resettle all of Biblical Israel, and restive\nPalestinians who wanted sovereignty and control over their own lives was\npotentially toxic, for both sides. Ideally, the process which had begun with Oslo\nmight start to disentangle it, though I remained far from confident that anything\nresembling full peace would come any time soon.\n\nRabin, and even more acutely Shimon Peres, believed it was important to\npress ahead with the opening phase of the handover of Israeli authority mapped\nout by Oslo. In May 1994, a draft of the so-called “Gaza and Jericho First”\nagreement was completed. Once it was ratified, the five-year interim period\nwould begin, with further withdrawals and parallel negotiations on the\n“permanent status” of the territories. In this first step, Israel would transfer civil\nauthority in Gaza Strip and the Jordan Valley town of Jericho to the\nPalestinians, and local security would be in the hands of a newly created\nPalestinian police force.\n\nMy primary concern, and my responsibility, was the security provisions in\nthe agreement, since the Israeli army retained its role in charge of overall\nsecurity. When I went to see Rabin a few days before the cabinet meeting to\napprove the Gaza-Jericho agreement, I told him I was worried that it left room\nfor potentially serious misunderstandings, friction and even clashes on the\nground. There was no clear definition of how our soldiers would operate\nalongside the new local police in the event of a terror attack, violence by Hamas\nor Islamic Jihad, or, for that matter, a car crash involving an Israeli and a\nPalestinian. He agreed this needed to be addressed, although it was clear he\nintended to do so with Arafat, via the Americans, not by reopening and delaying\nthe formal agreement.\n\nBut I had a deeper concern about the entire Oslo Agreement, which I also\nnow raised with Rabin. I did not doubt the importance of reaching a political\nagreement, and ideally a peace treaty, with the Palestinians. But I’d now read\nthe Oslo Declaration in greater detail, and discussed it with lawyer friends of\nmine. I’d also re-read the 1978 Camp David framework on which the self-rule\nprovisions were based. The endpoint was pretty clear, just as it had been at\nCamp David: Palestinian authority over the West Bank and Gaza, defined as a\n\n261\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011732",
