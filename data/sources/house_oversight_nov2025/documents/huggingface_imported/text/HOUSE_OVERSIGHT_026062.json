  "text": "The BRIDGE platform currently comprises investments of between €20-120 million each, in 17 European\ninfrastructure transactions. In 2016 alone, the BRIDGE team has achieved financial close for 11 infrastructure\ndeals in Europe aggregating ca. €390m. When benchmarked against other similar funds, the investment team\nhas succeeded in deploying faster and with credit spreads well above the infrastructure senior debt benchmark,\nenabling BRIDGE to become a force in the growing institutions-backed infrastructure debt market. BRIDGE’s\nability to invest beyond the traditional definition of core infrastructure and to structure transactions was a key\ndifferentiator when Edmond de Rothschild launched this platform, as part of its commitment to real economy.\nBRIDGE is innovative in the sense that the investment team sources transactions directly from sponsors and is\nactively involved in the structuring phase, acting as Mandated Lead Arranger.\n\nBRIDGE comprises a large, international and skilled London based investment team of 11 investment\nprofessionals who between them have arranged more than €100bn of landmark infrastructure deals over the\nlast 20 years across the globe. The BRIDGE team is among the largest within the debt funds universe and\ndemonstrates the Edmond de Rothschild Group’s commitment to the platform.\n\nKind regards,\nJohnny\n\nJohnny el HACHEM\n\nEdmond de Rothschild Private Equity\n\n29 Route de Pré-Bois\nCase postale 490\n1215 Genéve 15\n\nSuisse\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026062",
