  "text": "were underweight at the start of the year too and missed the lows. We recognized we\nwere wrong and closed our underweight and while it took us a while but we eventually\nmanaged to go overweight in September. The lesson of that is that themes are great,\nbut when the facts change strategists and investors have to change their minds.\n\nChart 11: Cyclicals vs Defensives: from -3.5SD to +3.2SD in 14 months Chart 12: Financials vs Defensives: -2.5SD to +2.5SD post Brexit\n4 4\n3 3\n2 2\n{ 1\n0 0\n-{ -1\nry) -2\n3 3\nA a\nDeeede Dec-01 Dec-05 Dec-09 Dec-13 Dec-97 Dec-01 Dec-05 Dec-09 Dec-13\n\nFinancials vs Defensives - relative price vs 52wk average (SD)\n\nCyclicals vs Defensives - relative price vs 52wk average (SD)\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg Source: Re BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg place this text\n\nIn fact your best guide to this year was to buy something when it has oversold,\nunderowned and unloved, like Miners and Emerging Markets in February, Banks in July,\nthe Nikkei the day of the US election and sell when the opposite e.g. bonds and\ndefensive equities shortly after Brexit. Our CTI models did actually pick up a number of\nthose events as the table below shows. It also got picked up by our standard deviation\nanalysis. We acted on some but not all of these readings. The lesson, with the benefit of\nhindsight, is to pay more attention to them. Indeed, our recent decision to downgrade\nboth Banks and Basic Resources reflected very high readings on our models.\n\nTable 1: Reflation rotation very stretched on our CTIs post-Trump Table 2: While opposite true immediately post-Brexit\nAsset 11/11/2016 10/11/2016 09/11/2016 Asset 29/06/2016 28/06/2016 27/06/2016\nEUR/GBP 46 44 -12 Relative Stoxx Autos -95 -39 9\nGerman 10y Bonds 66 61 24 Relative Stoxx Banks -80 -83 -86\nUS 10y Bonds 96 96 93 Relative Stoxx Basic Resources 21 3 0\nStoxx Banks 80 iA 0 Relative Stoxx Chemicals 2 19 40\nStoxx Basic Resources 92 93 92 Relative Stoxx Construction & Materials -10 -36 1\nStoxx Food & Beverages -84 -96 -54 Relative Stoxx Financial Services -91 -91 -92\nStoxx Insurance 67 64 23 Relative Stoxx Food & Beverages 60 18 82\nStoxx Personal & Household Goods -34 15 -T Relative Stoxx Healthcare 88 88 88\nStoxx Utilities -92 -94 -19 Relative Stoxx Industrial Goods &\n; A? -35 44\nServices\nRelative Stoxx Banks Relative Stoxx Insurance -87 -94 -94\nRelative Stoxx Basic Resources 100 100 o9 Relative Stoxx Media 6 “13 39\nRelative Stoxx Food & Beverages -93 -93 -89 Relative Stoxx Oil & Gas 93 86 91\nRelative Stoxx Insurance 9? 94 16 Relative Stoxx Personal & Household 57 58 70\nRelative Stoxx Media -34 TT 87 Goods\nRelative Stoxx Pers&Hhold Goods -92 -94 fh Relative Stoxx Retail 63 81 1\nRelative Stoxx Technology -80 -14 -55 Relative Stoxx Technology 0 0 0\nRelative Stoxx Telecom -91 -92 -28 Relative Stoxx Telecom 3 0 -16\nRelative Stoxx Utilities i) -92 59 Relative Stoxx Travel & Leisure -98 -100 -100\nRelative Stoxx Utilities 65 6 2\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\n\nWe think 2017 is another year where investors will need to be nimble. Markets have\nresponded enthusiastically to a prospective Trump Presidency but as the above charts\nsuggest we may well have discounted much of it. That is also supported by our fixed\nincome and FX forecasts, which suggest much has already been priced in. In addition we\nhave political risk starting with next weekend’s Italian referendum stretching to the\nGerman elections in Autumn 2017. In the middle we have the crucial French elections.
