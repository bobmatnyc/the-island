  "text": "12 JAM v. INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORP.\n\nOpinion of the Court\n\neign immunity. Jbid.\n\nWe do not agree. The delegation provision is most\nnaturally read to allow the President to modify, on a\ncase-by-case basis, the immunity rules that would other-\nwise apply to a particular international organization. The\nstatute authorizes the President to take action with re-\nspect to a single organization—“any such organization”—\nin light of the functions performed by “such organization.”\n28 U.S.C. §288. The text suggests retail rather than\nwholesale action, and that is in fact how authority under\n§288 has been exercised in the past. See, e.g., Exec. Order\nNo. 12425, 3 CFR 198 (1984) (designating INTERPOL as\nan international organization under the IOIA but with-\nholding certain privileges and immunities); Exec. Order\nNo. 11718, 8 CFR 177 (1974) (same for INTELSAT). In\nany event, the fact that the President has power to modify\notherwise applicable immunity rules is perfectly compati-\nble with the notion that those rules might themselves\nchange over time in light of developments in the law gov-\nerning foreign sovereign immunity.\n\nThe D. C. Circuit in Atkinson also gave no consideration\nto the opinion of the State Department, whose views in\nthis area ordinarily receive “special attention.” Bolivarian\nRepublic of Venezuela v. Helmerich & Payne Int'l. Drilling\nCo., 581 U.S. __, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 9). Shortly after\nthe FSIA was enacted, the State Department took the\nposition that the immunity rules of the IOIA and the FSIA\nwere now “link[ed].” Letter from Detlev F. Vagts, Office of\nthe Legal Adviser, to Robert M. Carswell, Jr., Senior Legal\nAdvisor, OAS, p.2 (Mar. 24, 1977). The Department\nreaffirmed that view during subsequent administrations,\nand it has reaffirmed it again here.2 That longstanding\n\n2See Letter from Roberts B. Owen, Legal Adviser, to Leroy D.
