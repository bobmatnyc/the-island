  "text": "LatAm: short BRL/MXN\n\nOur top contrarian trade in Latin American markets is selling BRL/MXN (spot 6.00,\ntarget 5.00, stop 6.75). The trade benefits from valuation, positioning and our views of\nthe expected effects of the US election on the Brazilian and Mexican economies.\n\nMXN 10% undervalued, BRL 5% overvalued\n\nWe estimate the Mexican peso is about 10% undervalued while the Brazilian real is\nabout 5% overvalued, based on our Compass valuation model. The model provides\nestimates of long-run equilibrium trade-weighted exchange rates consistent with the\nconvergence of current account balances toward levels that are in line with country\nfundamentals that determine savings and investments.\n\nMexico’s real exchange rate index is at its lowest since at least 1999, and about 35%\ncheaper than its long-run average. Brazil’s real exchange rate has risen sharply in 2016\nand is now around 8% stronger than its long-run average (Chart 48).\n\nLatAm under Trump’s world\n\nWe believe the election of Donald Trump as the next president of the US will be\nnegative to Latin American economies. His economic plan will likely involve a significant\nfiscal expansion, perhaps tighter monetary policy and some protectionist’s measures.\nThese will likely lead to higher US rates and a strengthening of the US dollar. Higher\ninternational interest rates are a negative shock for emerging economies and any\nacceleration in US economic growth will be skewed to domestic nontraded goods.\n\nWe think Brazil’s economy will likely be more negatively affected since its strategy to\ngradually reduce budget deficits is based on low global rates, capital inflows and higher\ndomestic growth.\n\nMexico, on the other hand, may benefit on relative terms from a construction and\ninfrastructure boom in the US. Any revival in US manufacturing would also be good for\nMexico, particularly if Trump’s protectionist measures are not as substantial as feared.\n\nMarket is not positioned for a MXN rally and BRL selloff\n\nSelling BRL/MXN is a contrarian trade. Foreign investors are significantly long BRL\naccording to our positioning index based on BM&F data. Market positioning by local\ninvestors is even more stretched toward long BRL. On the contrary, speculative\ninvestors are short MXN according our positioning index based on CFTC data (Chart 49).\nSo positioning unwinding would actually help our short BRL/MXN strategy.\n\nChart 48: Real exchange rate is cheap in Mexico, expensive in Brazil Chart 49: Market is positioned long BRL and short MXN\n450 450 3 Long BRL and MXN positionining 3\nLong-run average = 100 25 25\n130 130 2\n1.5 1.5\n110 110 1 1\n0.5 0.5\n90 90 0 0\n0.5 0.5\n70 70 -1 -1\n-1.5 -15\n00 01 02 03 04 05 06 07 08 09 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 2013\n= Brazil real exchange rate —-—=Mexico real exchange rate == Long BRL position — Long MXN position\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg\nBankot America\n\n26 Global Rates, FX & EM 2017 Year Ahead | 16 November 2016\n\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014756",
