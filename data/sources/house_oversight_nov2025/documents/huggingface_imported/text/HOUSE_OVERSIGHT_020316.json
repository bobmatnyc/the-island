(Whitworth, who was arrested by the FBI in 1985, was\nconvicted of espionage and sentenced to 365 years in prison.)\n\nThe Internet provided an almost ideal environment for false flags since its users commonly\nadopt aliases, screen names, and other avatars. The threat officer explained how easy it would be\nfor the KGB to adapt such a false flag when dealing with a dissident system administrator\nworking for US intelligence. As the threat officer pointed out in his report, the KGB had used\nfalse flags in the late 1980s to surreptitiously recruit members of the “German Hanover Hackers,”\na community of anarchistic hackers who breached computer networks for fun and profit. Up\nuntil then, these hacktavists stole corporate and private passwords, credit card information, and\nother privileged documents as a form of freelance espionage. Because of their fervent anti-\nauthority ideology, the KGB disguised its recruiters as fellow hacktavists. The KGB succeeded in\ngetting the Hanover hackers to steal log-in account identifications, source codes and other\ninformation from U.S. government computer networks.\n\nThe precise vulnerability that this threat officer pointed out in 1996 was system administrators.\n\nThis weak link became increasingly relevant as the NSA moved further into the digital age. By the\nbeginning of the 21* century, its growing networks of computers were largely run by civilian\ntechnicians, including system administrators, infrastructure analysts, and information\ntechnologists, who were need to keep the system running. Despite the warning by the threat\nofficer, the NSA became more reliant on these outsiders as it reorganized to meet its new\nmandates for surveillance of the Internet in the war on terrorism. Since the NSA had to compete\nwith technology companies, such as Google, Apple and Facebook, for the services of experienced\nIT workers, it used private contractors to find them. They, in turn, recruited civilian technicians\nfrom many unconventional areas, including the hacking culture. Ex-hackers, who lacked (or\nshunned) employment opportunities in the corporate sector, were suitable candidates for the\nsystem administrator jobs that these films had contracted to supply the NSA. In the rush to\nexpand, little heed was paid to the 1996 warning that this hacking culture might provide a portal\nto anti-government hacktavist groups. The NSA became so enamored with this new technology\nthat it neglected the security implications of employing outsiders, “All of us just fell in love with\nthe ease and convenience and scale [of electronic storage]”, Michael Hayden, who headed the\nNSA at the time, said to the Wall Street Journal in 2015. “So we decided to take things we used\nto keep if not in a safe, at least in our desk drawer, and put it up here [in a computer network],\nwhere it’s by definition more vulnerable.” | Making matters even worse, as has been previously\ndiscussed, the NSA stripped away much of the so-called stove-piping that insulated highly-\nsensitive data from the NSA’s other computer networks. Here they were merely following the\nrecommendations of the 9/11 Commission to make their data more accessible to other agencies\nconcerned with potential terrorist attacks. As a result, the inner sanctum of the NSA became\nmore opened to its new army of civilian technicians.\n\nThe universe of independent contractors was governed by very different forces than that of\nintelligence services. By 2013, much of the job of managing the NSA’s classified computers had\nbeen handed over to five private companies: Booz Allen Hamilton, which handled the most highly\nsecret work; and Dell SecureWorks, Microsoft, Raytheon, and IBM.
