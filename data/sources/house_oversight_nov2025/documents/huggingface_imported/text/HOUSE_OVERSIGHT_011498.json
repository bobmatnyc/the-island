All around us the grown-ups\nwere singing and dancing in celebration.\n\nOn the Arab side, there was no rejoicing. Every one of the Arab delegations\nat the UN voted against partition, rejecting a Jewish state even if it was created\nalong with a Palestinian Arab one. Violence erupted the next day. An attack on\na bus near Lydda, near the road up to Jerusalem, left six Jews dead. Similar\nattacks occurred around the country. Shooting broke out in mixed Arab-and-\nJewish towns and cities: Jaffa on the southern edge of Tel Aviv. Safed, Tiberias\nand Haifa in the north, and in Jerusalem.\n\nI followed all this with curiosity and trepidation through my halting attempts\nto read Davar le Yeladim, the weekly children’s edition of the Labour Zionist\nnewspaper Davar. We children felt an additional connection with what was\ngoing on. One of our Dror housemates, a boy named Giora Ros, had left the\nyear before when his father took a job in Jerusalem. As the battle for the city\nraged through the end of 1947 and into 1948, its besieged Jewish residents\nfought for their lives.

Marching through the night from\nJerusalem, they had made it only within a couple of miles of Gush Etzion when\nthey were surrounded and attacked by local Arabs. By late afternoon, all of\nthem were dead. When the British authorities recovered their bodies, they found\nthat the enemy had not simply killed them. All of the bodies had been battered\nand broken. Rumors spread that in some cases, the dead men’s genitals had\nbeen cut off and shoved into their mouths. Since I was still a few weeks short of\nmy sixth birthday, I was spared that particular detail. But not the sense of horror\nover what had happened, nor the central message: the lengths and depths to\nwhich the Arabs of Palestine seemed ready to go in their fight against us.\n“Hit’alelu bagufot!” was the only slightly sanitized account we children were\ngiven. “They mutilated the corpses!”\n\nEven after the partition vote, statehood was not a given.
