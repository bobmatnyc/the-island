A schematic filed with the Department of Planning and Natural Resources shows development plans for Great St.
James island.

ST. THOMAS — Wealthy sex offender Jeffrey Epstein has been
quietly working for years to construct anew compound on
Great St. James island off the East End of St. Thomas, adding
to a massive real estate portfolio that also includes
neighboring Little St. James island, which has been his
primary residence for decades.

V.I. Department of Planning and Natural Resources
spokesman Jamal Nielsen confirmed Monday that at least
some of that construction activity has been taking place
without permission from the government — the third time

in as many years that Epstein has gone beyond the scope of

Jeffrey Epstein
HOGP permitted building plans.
“We have confirmed that there’s unauthorized work going on
at Great St. James, we have been in touch with the owners
and we are setting up to have a meeting with them soon, to
rectify this,” Nielsen said.
