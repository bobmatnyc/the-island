  "text": "Christian, Shi’ite Muslim, Druse and ethnically mixed — with the aim of\nreflecting the balance in each part of the south.\n\nIsraeli troops might still have to cross into Lebanon, but only for brief,\ntargeted operations to preempt preparations for a terror attack. “We need to\nremember what we’re there for,” I said. “We have no territorial claims. It’s to\nprotect the north of Israel. But it will end up being about protecting our own\ntroops inside the security zone. It will be like the Bar-Lev line in 1973, fighting\nfor fortifications we don’t need.” I couldn’t persuade him. I’m sure he\nunderstood the argument, and he may even have agreed. But when Katyushas\nnext fell on northern Israel, he as Minister of Defense, not I, would be the one in\nthe political firing line.\n\nFar from straining our relations, our frank exchanges on Lebanon seemed to\nbuild further trust between us. We worked closely on a range of issues. When\nSayeret Matkal or another intelligence unit planned an operation across our\nborders, both of us would present the action to the cabinet. During the\noperations, I’d be either in the kirva or a forward command post. Since nearly\nall of them happened after nightfall, Yitzhak would usually be back home,\nasleep, by the time they ended. I would phone him. The trademark voice — slow,\ngravelly, deep even when he was wide awake — would answer. I’d tell him the\nmission was over and — with only one exception during my period as head of\nintelligence — successful. “Todah,” he would say. “Lehitraot.” Thanks. Bye. He\nwas never a man to waste words.\n\nFor one of the very few times I can remember, He phoned me one morning in\nOctober 1985. It came a couple of days after an especially gruesome Palestinian\nterror attack. Even with Arafat now more than a thousand miles away in Tunis,\nmuch of Rabin’s focus was taken up in responding to, or trying to preempt,\nPalestinian terrorism. The issue was especially sensitive politically in the wake\nof a war in Lebanon that was supposed to have eliminated that threat. For Rabin,\nmoreover, it had become personal. He’d had to sanction an unprecedented\nexchange of 1,150 Palestinian security prisoners earlier in the year to secure the\nfreedom of three Israeli soldiers, including one of our men from Sultan Yacoub,\nwho had ended up in the hands of the radical Popular Front for the Liberation of\nPalestine — General Command. Now a group from another of the radical factions,\nthe Palestine Liberation Front, had hijacked an Italian cruise ship called the\nAchille Lauro en route from Egypt to Israel. They murdered one of the\npassengers, a wheelchair-bound, 69-year-old Jewish American named Leon\nKlinghoffer, and dumped his body overboard.\n\n217\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028065",
