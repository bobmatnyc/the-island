  "text": "Many Iran watchers assert that to persuade Tehran not to pursue a nuclear weapon,\nWashington must reassure Khamenei that the United States merely seeks a change in\n\nIranian behavior, not a change of the Iranian regime.\n\nWhat they fail to consider is Khamenei's deep-seated conviction that U.S. designs to\noverthrow the Islamic Republic hinge not on military invasion but on cultural and political\nsubversion intended to foment a \"velvet\" revolution from within. Consider this revealing\n\naddress on Iranian state TV in 2005:\n\nMore than Iran's enemies need artillery, guns, and so forth, they need to spread cultural\nvalues that lead to moral corruption.... I recently read in the news that a senior official in\nan important American political center said: \"Instead of bombs, send them miniskirts.” He\nis right. If they arouse sexual desires in any given country, if they spread unrestrained\nmixing of men and women, and if they lead youth to behavior to which they are naturally\ninclined by instincts, there will no longer be any need for artillery and guns against that\n\nnation.\n\nKhamenei's vast collection of writings and speeches makes clear that the weapons of mass\ndestruction he fears most are cultural -- more Kim Kardashian and Lady Gaga than bunker\nbusters and aircraft carriers. In other words, Tehran is threatened not only by what\nAmerica does, but by what America is: a depraved, postmodern colonial power bent on\nachieving global cultural hegemony. America's \"strategic policy,” Khamenei has said, \"is\n\nseeking female promiscuity.”\n\nKhamenei's words capture the paradox and perversion of modern Iran. While dropping\nbombs on the Iranian regime could likely prolong its shelf-life, a regime that sees women's\n\nhair as an existential threat is already well past its sell-by date.\n\nKarim Sadjadpour is senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026562",
