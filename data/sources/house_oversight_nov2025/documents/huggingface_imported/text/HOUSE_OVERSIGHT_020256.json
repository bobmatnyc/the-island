  "text": "104\n\njournalists in each country to make their own assessment, independent of my bias, as to\nwhether or not the knowledge of U.S. network operations against their people should be\npublished.” So as late as June 14\", Snowden was still reading and assessing the files he had\nstolen from the NSA four weeks earlier.\n\nPoitras vetted the Lam interview. Soon afterwards she suspected that she was being followed.\nThat was likely since by this June 14th all the intelligence services in Hong Kong knew that she\nwas in contact with Snowden. “I was being tailed,” she recalled in an interview with a Vogue\nreporter in Berlin in 2014. “The risks became very great,” she said in describing her situation in\nHong Kong. So, on June 15\", she left Hong Kong and flew back to Berlin, where she began\nediting her footage of the Snowden interview.\n\nMeanwhile, Snowden was organizing his own exit from Hong Kong. He placed a call to Julian\nAssange.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020256",
