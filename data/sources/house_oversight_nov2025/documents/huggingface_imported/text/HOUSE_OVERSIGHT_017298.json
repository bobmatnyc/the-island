I have helped to defend several\nsoldiers, most prominently Colonel Michael Steele, the real life hero of the tragic events in\nMogadishu that gave rise to the film “Blackhawk Down.” I have also helped to defend ordinary\nenlisted men accused of unlawful killings of non-combatants.\n\nSeveral of Colonel Steele’s enlisted men had killed Iraqi civilians following a deadly attack by\nIraqi militants against U.S. soldiers. Colonel Steele was being investigated for instructions\nregarding the rules of engagement that he had given to his men prior to the killings. Some higher-\nups believed that his speech had incited the killings, or at the very least had created an atmosphere\nin which such killings would be seen as acceptable. Colonel Steele adamantly denied any such\nresponsibility and asked me to help his military lawyers prepare a defense to any such charge.\n\nThe rules of engagement for terrorist groups are confusing at best. The directive Colonel Steele\nhad received granted him the authority to target “groups, cells and facilities belonging to terrorist\ngroups.” How to distinguish such groups from non-combatants in the fog of asymmetric warfare,\nin which terrorists blend into the civilian population, is one of the most daunting challenges of\nmodern combat. After conducting extensive research on the applicable law and on what Colonel\nSteele had actually told his men, I was convinced that he had complied both with the letter and\nspirit of the laws of war, and that the soldiers who had killed civilians were not following his\nlawful directives. We prepared a brief arguing against any charges been brought against the\nColonel.\n\nIn the end Colonel Steele was not charged with any crime but his career was harmed by the\nallegation. In appreciation for my work on his case, the Colonel sent me an American flag that\nhad been “flown for 9 minutes and 11 seconds over the 3 Brigade Combat Team Head Quarters,\nTikrit, Iraq” near a flag that was “hanging inside of Building #7 on the morning of 11 September\n2011.” In his letter accompanying the flag, Colonel Steel explained that a policeman, ran into\nBuilding Seven right after the attack to help get everyone out. On his way out, he saw the flag in\nthe atrium and took it down. “The building came down about ten minutes later.” The policeman\ngave the Colonel the flag to take with him into combat. Colonel Steel ended his letter with the\nfollowing words: “My sincerest thanks, Alan, for all you have done for me and for the men of the\nRakkasans.” The flag stands in a place of honor in my home office, as a reminder of those who\nhave given their lives to defend our liberties.\n\nThe complex issues surrounding the war against terrorists plays out not only on the battlefields of\nIraq and Afghanistan, but in Israel and Gaza as well. I stand ready to defend Israeli soldiers and\ncommanders who have been falsely accused of killing Palestinian civilians in their efforts to\nprotect Israeli civilians from terrorist rocket attacks. In 2011, I traveled to the Hague in an effort\nto persuade the prosecutor of the International Criminal Court not to bring charges based on the\ndeeply flawed “Goldstone Report,” whose conclusions Richard Goldstone himself subsequently\nrepudiated. I have represented the Mossad in its efforts to prevent prosecution of its agents by\n\n211\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017298",
