  "text": "airplane accident. Well, networks will produce the network accident. Many, in fact.\nA world primed for contagtion, Gates suggested, needs - and is missing - more and\nbetter gates. (Yes, here you can pause to double take at the serendipitously strange\nfact that the wealthiest citizen of our gated age is named Gates, just as the richest\nman in the era of pulling oil out of rocks was a “Rockefeller”) Connection demands\nsystems to gaze ceaselessly for the smallest sign of assault or need for change or\naccidental shimmering movement of danger. Part of what made the Ebola response\nsuccessful is that the response really was in the form of gates as we've come to\nunderstand them here, not walls. Protocols for biological reaction, for medical care,\nfor epidemic monitoring, the urgent helicoperting in of support and aid and ideas.\nThe gates assembled around the Ebola pandemic were its solution. Had it merely\nbeen walled off it would have spiked, grown, mutated and finally escaped.”The\nworld,” Gates wrote, “needs to build a warning and response system for outbreaks.”\nThis is true for all the outbreaks we face - whether they are disease or financial\npanic or terror. There will be, you can be sure, ignorant calls to build walls and not\ngates. This misses the point of networks. In an age of interconnection walls are\nnearly as dangerous as no walls. What matters is bulding topologies designed for\ngating, for milking power from the profound logic of networks we've seen at work.\n\nFor decades after the 1929 financial crisis triggered an historic global depression,\neconomists and politicians debated what had gone wrong. What had they missed?\nThe world, it emerged, had been wired with an economic system designed rapid\nmovement, but politicians and bankers had forgotten to put in the needed brakes.\nThey had tried to run an industrial engine against the background of gasping\npolitical structures. Basic adjustment mechanisms - release valves for financial or\ncurrency pressures — had not been invented, refined or installed.238 When we find\nourselves in coming years gasping through some sort of financial crisis of our own,\nor running scared from a cascading military or social epidemic that slaps us\nunexpectedly, what do you think the most likely cause will be? It will be a failure of\ngates. Too few in some places; too damn many in others.\n\nRemember the haunting, persistent vulnerability of our age. A twitch anywhere in\nthe system can rock and even crack the whole edifice. Space Time Compression’s\nability to shrink distance to zero and time to an instant can turn anywhere, anytime\ninto a battlefield or a spot for revolutionary innovation. Any moment can present us\nwith questions of war and peace. Today we have no central theory of gatekeeping,\nno ideas about balancing inside and out. We fly on instincts, but they are the old\nindustrial ones. Anyone can see a system that is full of holes and inconsistencies. Can\nyou see a way through it, though? Pressed by political, technical and economic\ndesire - to say nothing of the basic urge for self-preservation - more gates will be\nwith us from now on.\n\n238 Basic adjustment: Ben S. Bernanke, “Money, Gold, and the Great Depression”, H.\nParker Willis Lecture in Economic Policy, Washington and Lee University, Lexington,\nVirginia March 2, 2004\n\n165\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018397",
