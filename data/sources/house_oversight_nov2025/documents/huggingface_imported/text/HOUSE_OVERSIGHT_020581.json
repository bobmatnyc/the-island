  "text": "122\n\nThe Dynamics of Chinese IP Theft\n\nChinese nontraditional collection and IP theft is not done randomly by individuals acting\non their own. Rather, China has enacted some two dozen laws that have created a state-\n\nrun foreign technology transfer apparatus that sponsors, for example, labs in China that\nrely wholly on information provided by compatriots working abroad. The apparatus also\nmaintains databases of foreign co-optees and distributes stipends, sinecures, and cash to\nforeign donors of high-tech innovations. In addition, the apparatus is responsible for the\ncare and feeding of agents willing to “serve China while in place” abroad.\n\nTargets\n\nChina targets all sources of American innovation, including universities, corporations,\n\nand government labs, exploiting both their openness and naiveté. The methods and\ntradecraft are custom-tailored to each target. For universities, China takes advantage of the\ncommitment to intellectual freedom on campus, which strongly resists government scrutiny\nof the activities of foreign students in hard science programs and international academic\ncooperation. For corporations, the lure of the China market gives Beijing tremendous\nleverage in exacting tech transfer from American firms, combined with financial incentives\nfor employees to purloin intellectual property for personal gain. Finally, US government labs\nhave a historic commitment to international scientific cooperation, and an uneven record of\nmonitoring that cooperation for unsanctioned transfers of information.\n\nThese efforts complement China’s legitimate efforts to invest in its own indigenous\ninnovative capacity. China has for several decades made science and technology\ndevelopment a priority and appears to have the political will to see it through. This is\ndemonstrated by the R&D funding programs it has put into place, the investment in core\nscientific infrastructure that is in some cases unparalleled anywhere else in the world, and\na national scientifically oriented industrial policy. Yet the continuing intense engagement\nin IP theft is, in many ways, an indication of the gaps in China’s indigenous innovation\nefforts.\n\nOnce acquired, foreign technology is converted in China into products and weapons at\n180 “Pioneering Parks for Overseas Chinese Scholars,” 160 “Innovation Service Centers,”\n276 “National Technology Model Transfer Organizations,” and an unknown number of\n“technology business incubators.” These facilities are strategically located to ensure wide\ndistribution of the foreign technologies.\n\nNontraditional Collectors\n\nNontraditional collectors include Chinese citizens, Chinese Americans with whom the\nChinese government is better able to cultivate or coerce, and other Americans. They\nrange from students to researchers. Many are willing participants, such as students from\n\nTechnology and Research\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020581",
