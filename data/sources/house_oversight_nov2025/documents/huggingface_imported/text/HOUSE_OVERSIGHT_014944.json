  "text": "to the credibility of online reviews, 4) Instant Book transition puts pressure on revenue\ngrowth, and 5) mobile monetization headwinds.\n\nUpside risks to our price objective are: 1} improved mobile monetization 2} major OTA\nsign on for instant booking 3) high non-hotel shopper dollar capture and 4) improved\nglobal macro environment.\n\nTrivago NV (TRVG)\n\nOur PO of $15 is based on a 3.5x 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We note that 3.5x is roughly\nin line with the lead generation peer group average 2018E EV/Sales multiple. We think\nour EV/Sales multiple is warranted as a balance between Trivago's higher growth and\nlower profitability. Our price objective is supported by our DCF analysis.\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) Growing competition, 2) Elevated marketing\nspend, 3) High Customer concentration, 4) Macro and FX risks, and 5) Potential for loss\nof hotel inventory.\n\nTwitter (TWTR)\n\nOur $14.5 price objective is based on 12x our 2018 EBITDA estimate, which reflects a\ndiscount to the online media group (13x). We believe the Twitter platform has slowing\nuser and revenue growth and as such, we expect the stock to trade at a sustained\ndiscount to online media peers, with potential M&A adding some offsetting downside\nsupport.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) decelerating user growth that may raise concerns on\nlong-term revenue opportunity, 2) pressure on usage due to emergence of competing\nservices, 3) new ad initiatives may not perform well, resulting in lower advertiser\ndemand for Twitter ads, 4) monetization of logged-out users and third party application\nusers are slow to materialize, and 5} on a EV/EBITDA basis Twitter is more attractive\ntoday than in the past, but stock remains subject to multiple compression.\n\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) User adds could ramp on new product initiatives in the 2H,\nand accelerating user growth may increase optimism on long-term revenue opportunity,\n2) with new demographic targeting initiatives, Twitter is able to capture more TV dollars\n(vs online ad dollars) that are incremental with video ads, 3) the NFL broadcasts and\nother video content (live political, entertainment, etc.) could help Twitter grow users\nmeaningfully in the long term, 4) guidance could prove to be conservative, 5) traction\nfrom monetization of logged-out users and 6) potential that Twitter could be acquired.\n\nWayfair (W)\n\nOur price objective of $44 is based on 0.7x 2018E EV/sales. We continue to focus on\nEV/Sales given Wayfair's lack of profitability to date. Our 0.7x target multiple is a\ndiscount to W's eCommerce comp group and at a modest discount to W's retail comp\ngroup. We think the multiple is appropriate given stronger revenue growth vs. peers,\nbalanced by lower profitability and competitive risks.\n\nDownside risks are: 1) GAAP operating losses expected through 2018, making valuation\nanalysis more complex, 2) competition from several well capitalized companies including\nAmazon, 3) brand complexity (5 brands), 4) category limitations, 5) partner segment\nrevenue headwinds, and 6) execution risk on International expansion.\n\nYahoo! (YHOO)\n\nOur price objective of $57 is based on our sum-of-parts valuation assumptions. Our $53\nestimated asset value represents $39/share from the remaining Alibaba stake (using\n$122 Alibaba valuation {10% discount rate, mid-term FCF FY18-25E CAGR of 18%, 4%\nterminal growth} x 384mn shares at 20% discount rate), $6.1 for Yahoo Japan, $0.5 for\nExcalibur patents, and $6.9 in cash and cash equivalents on Yahoo's balance sheet.
