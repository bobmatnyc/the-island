  "text": "and | once had an extreme/y animated discussion on the decriminalization\nof abortion. Can you imagine what the Democrats would’ ve done with\nthat?\"\n\nAnd that was the precise instant | made the decision to leak\nProfessor Hill’ s statement to the press. Although | have constantly been\nsexually Aass/ed, | have never really been harassed in the /ega/sense of the\nword. However, | Aave had an abortion, and | was totally outraged by the\nblatant hypocrisy I’ d overheard. | had never leaked a document before,\nbut my anger overshadowed my fear.\n\n| chose Nina Totenberg because | had come to trust her reporting\nabout the Supreme Court on National Public Radio. | honestly had no idea\nwhat leaking the affidavit would accomplish. | certainly did not envision\nthat it would literally embarrass the Senate into delaying the vote until\npublic hearings were held, though that probably was my secret desire.\n\nBut Judge Thomas testified under oath that he had never discussed\nthe subject of abortion. However, in response to a question by Senator\nHank Brown, Professor Hill testified that she had disagreed with Judge\nThomas in a discussion about Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, then-Senator\nJoseph Biden quickly interrupted her.\n\n“That is not the subject of these hearings,” he said.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015135",
