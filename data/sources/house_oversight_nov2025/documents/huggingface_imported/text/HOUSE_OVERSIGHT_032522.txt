I was never worried about space.. I always knew he was enamored with human space exploration because it is
big and showy.. I even wrote that in print early on.. for him that is science.. it isn’t for those of us who know.. it
is more bad news as far as I am concerned because this big budget will decimate real science.. 900 million cut
in DOE office fo science will kill particle physics.. will end funding for me, for example..
