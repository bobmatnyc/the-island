  "text": "3) Historically, sex has usually been defined in terms of two things: (a) reproduction,\nand (b) the sexual pleasure of stereotypical men. Cultural sexual standards are based\non these things. For example, the sexual \"base system\"; if you've read my work before\nthen you'll have seen me talk about it a lot, because it's such a perfect example. It's\ncommonly discussed among USA schoolchildren and it describes kissing as \"first base,”\ngroping as \"second base,\" oral sex as \"third base\" and penis-in-vagina sex as \"home\nbase.” Why should this hierarchy exist? It only makes sense if we think of sex as being\ncentered around reproduction. If we think of sex as being about pleasure and open\nexploration in ways that are different for everyone, then having a \"home base\" -- a\nstandardized goal -- makes zero sense.\n\nAnother example: penis-in-vagina sex is often seen as \"real\" sex or \"actual\" sex, with all\nother sex considered \"less real.\" How many arguments have you had over the course of\nyour lifetime about whether oral sex \"counts\" as sex? (Hint: more than the subject\ndeserves.) For a recent example, there's the Kink.com virgin shoot, wherein a porn model\npublicly \"lost her virginity\" notwithstanding the fact that she'd already had plenty of oral\nand anal sex on camera for years -- she'd just never had vaginal sex.\n\nAs for sex being defined by the pleasure of stereotypical men: one example is how people\nusually think about orgasms. In my experience and that of people I talk to -- and in the\nvast majority of porn -- it seems commonly accepted that sexual activity ends with a\nman's orgasm, whereas women are commonly expected to continue engaging in sex after\nhaving an orgasm... despite the fact that many women seem just as tired and less-\ninterested in sex post-orgasm as many men are. In part, this goes back to defining sex in\nterms of reproduction: men have to orgasm in order for reproduction to happen, so men's\norgasms must (supposedly) be central to sex. It's all influenced by these other\nconstructions, like how penis-in-vagina sex is \"real\" sex, or \"home base\": many people\nare confused by the idea that you'd shift sexual gears to (for example) manual stimulation\nif you've already \"made it to home base.\" But it also arises from centering stereotypical\nmen’s desires -- from a culture that just generally sees them as more important, more\ndriving, and more necessary than women's. (Note that the majority of women don't\"\nachieve orgasm from penis-in-vagina sex in itself.)\n\nWhen sex is defined in terms of reproduction and stereotypical male pleasure, the\nfollowing things result:\n\n+ People who aren't men have a harder time understanding their sexuality, because there\nare fewer models (for example: it's fairly common for women to figure out how to have\norgasms much later in life than the average man -- like 20s or 30s, if ever)\n\n+ Men who don't fit masculine stereotypes have a harder time understanding their\nsexuality (for example: there's a great essay by a former men's magazine editor in the\nanthology Best Sex Writing 2010 in which he talks about how hard it was for him to come\nto terms with his desire for heavy women)\n\n+ Even men who do fit masculine stereotypes feel limited from other types of\nexploration, and may derive less pleasure from sex than they would in a less broken\nworld\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018481",
