  "text": "RICHARD SAUL WURMAN\n\nDescribed by Fortune magazine as an “intellectual hedonist”\n\nwith a “hummingbird mind,” Richard Saul Wurman\nseeks ways to make the complex clear. Recognizing at\nan early age that his ignorance is his greatest asset, he\nhas made it his mission to sort through the abundance\nof information that is available on every topic, and\ndesign the techniques to make it understandable.\n\nIn doing so he has continually sought to put himself\nin the presence of extraordinary people, including (all now\nall deceased), Francis Crick, Richard Feynman, Jonas Salk,\nEva Zeisel, Louis I. Kahn, Charles Eames, Frank Stanton and\nSchuyler van Renssalaer Cammann, and Arnold Toynbee.\nThere are many others. The only two bosses he had who\ndidn’t fire him were Lou Kahn and Charlie Eames.\n\nAs aresult, Wurman has had many lives: as an author\n(83 books); FAIA Architect, 13-year partner in Murphy Levy\nWurman Architects; cartographer (mapped 1/3 of the Mayan\ncity of Tikal and current project 19.20.21.); teacher (Cambridge\nUniversity, England; Princeton; Washington University,\nSt. Louis; University of Southern California; University of\nCalifornia Los Angeles; City College of New York, and Dean,\nCal Poly School of Design); urban designer (recipient of MIT’s\nKevin Lynch award in urban design); graphic designer (AIGA\nGold Medal, membership in AGI and inducted into the Art\nDirectors Hall of Fame); information theorist Information\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017569",
