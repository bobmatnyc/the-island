  "text": "was a machine that could think in ways a human could never understand, let alone\nachieve. For such a device, to pass Turing’s Test or slip past a Voight-Kampff check\nmachine will be trivial. In his 1950 paper, Turing sensed the possibility of this\ndevelopment - and the crisis that might ensue. Could man handle the crushing\nsensation that a device was outperforming him? Perhaps dramatically. “We like to\nbelieve that Man is in some subtle way superior to the rest of creation,” Turing\nwrote. “It is best if he can be shown to be necessarily superior, for then there is no\ndanger of him losing his commanding position.” What would have surprised Turing,\nI suppose, is the speed at which we've acquiesced - and even accelerated - this very\nloss of our dominance.\n\nImagine a device poking at the very origins of the universe at a speed of trillions of\ncalculations a second, spinning past Newton’s and Einstein’s laws and into a realm\nof physics apprehensible only inside its own electronic consciousness. Compacting\ntime - centuries of human scientific labor reproduced in moments - before shooting\nfar ahead, alone to a subtle knowledge we can only envy. Such a machine would not,\nas Newton had, stand on the shoulders of giants so much as it would muscle its own,\nunique way ahead. The AI would have disappeared, but to a place very different\nthan where Maes’ AI had gone. Hers had been erased by human design. This new,\nreally “thinking” AI would slip to invisibility because of its own light-speed\ncognition. It would think itself out of our understanding. No human could follow,\nlimited as we are by our wet, slow, decaying biological software. Humans and\ncomputers, after all, deal with information differently. Think of how poor your\nmemory is compared with the perfect fidelity of a machine, or the way people can\neven “remember” events that never happened. The machines would have more than\nknowledge, then. They would linger close to a possessing a profound and\ninscrutable wisdom. They would inhabit an honestly miraculous gateland that no\nhuman would ever enter. And this is where the problems would begin.\n\n2.\n\nWe've now passed the moment when humans completely train the very best\nmachines. The AI devices can teach themselves, now. Of course there are still\ndecades of adjustment, of leaps in hardware and programming ideas to eliminate\nthe seams between our minds and the fused ideas of a digital system. But the\nhumans in the loop of the best of these designs, the hard working and well meaning\ngeniuses of the New Caste, are as much trainers as engineers now. They resemble\nshipbuilders of an earlier era, preparing vessels for voyages to lands they will never\nthemselves see. Their digital minds - technically machine learning structures such\nas deep neural networks - run quickly to the frontiers. Every moment, all around us,\nmachines are educating themselves. About the world. About themselves. About us\ntoo. Tuned AI plays games, looks at photos, studies chemical reactions, reads your\nemail and watches you drive - and then it tries to unspool just what is going on,\nbefore winding it up into a new instinct. Machine learning systems already produce\nmathematical proofs that linger beyond what a human mind can understand; next\nmay be a machine-to-machine mathematics that expands the dimensions of thought.\n(In aman and machine fusion that surely would have unnerved Joseph Weizenbaum\n\n189\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018421",
