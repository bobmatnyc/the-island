This\nfinal rule sets forth the Board’s review\nof and responses to comments on the\nproposal and incorporates any changes\nmade to the rule in response to those\ncomments.\n\nThe Board believes that many\nemployees protected by the NLRA are\nunaware of their rights under the statute\nand that the rule will increase\nknowledge of the NLRA among\nemployees, in order to better enable the\nexercise of rights under the statute. A\nbeneficial side effect may well be the\npromotion of statutory compliance by\nemployers and unions.\n\nThe final rule establishes the size,\nform, and content of the notice, and sets\nforth provisions regarding the\nenforcement of the rule.\n\nDATES: This rule will be effective on\nNovember 14, 2011.\n\nFOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONTACT:\nLester A. Heltzer, Executive Secretary,\nNational Labor Relations Board, 1099\n14th Street, NW., Washington, DC\n20570, (202) 273-1067 (this is not a toll-\nfree number), 1-866-315-6572 (TTY/\nTDD).\n\nSUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION:\n\nI. Background on the Rulemaking\n\nThe NLRA, enacted in 1935, is the\nFederal statute that regulates most\nprivate sector labor-management\nrelations in the United States.1 Section\n7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 157,\nguarantees that\n\nEmployees shall have the right to self-\norganization, to form, join, or assist labor\norganizations, to bargain collectively through\nrepresentatives of their own choosing, and to\nengage in other concerted activities for the\npurpose of collective bargaining or other\n\n1 Labor-management relations in the railroad and\nairline industries are governed by the Railway\nLabor Act, 45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.\n\nmutual aid or protection, and shall also have\nthe right to refrain from any or all such\nactivities[.]\n\nIn Section 1, 29 U.S.C. 151, Congress\nexplained why it was necessary for\nthose rights to be protected:\n\nThe denial by some employers of the right\nof employees to organize and the refusal by\nsome employers to accept the procedure of\ncollective bargaining lead to strikes and other\nforms of industrial strife or unrest, which\nhave the intent or the necessary effect of\nburdening or obstructing commerce[.] * * *\n* * * * *\n\nExperience has proved that protection by\nlaw of the right of employees to organize and\nbargain collectively safeguards commerce\nfrom injury, impairment, or interruption, and\npromotes the flow of commerce by removing\ncertain recognized sources of industrial strife\nand unrest, by encouraging practices\nfundamental to the friendly adjustment of\nindustrial disputes arising out of differences\nas to wages, hours, or other working\nconditions, and by restoring equality of\nbargaining power between employers and\nemployees.\n\n* * * * *\n\nIt is declared to be the policy of the United\nStates to eliminate the causes of certain\nsubstantial obstructions to the free flow of\ncommerce and to mitigate and eliminate\nthese obstructions when they have occurred\nby encouraging the practice and procedure of\ncollective bargaining and by protecting the\nexercise by workers of full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their own\nchoosing, for the purpose of negotiating the\nterms and conditions of their employment or\nother mutual aid or protection.\n\nThus, Congress plainly stated that, in its\njudgment, protecting the rights of\nemployees to form and join unions and\nto engage in collective bargaining would\nbenefit not only the employees\nthemselves, but the nation as a whole.\nThe Board was established to ensure\nthat employers and, later, unions\nrespect the exercise of employees’ rights\nunder the NLRA.?\n\nFor employees to fully exercise their\nNLRA rights, however, they must know\nthat those rights exist and that the Board\nprotects those rights. As the Board\nexplained in its Notice of Proposed\nRulemaking (NPRM), 75 FR 80410, it\nhas reason to think that most do not.3\n\n2 The original NLRA did not include restrictions\non the actions of unions; those were added in the\nLabor-Management Relations (Taft-Hartley) Act of\n1947, 29 U.S.C. 141 et seq., Title I.\n\n3 The Board cited three law review articles in\nwhich the authors contended that American\nworkers are largely unaware of their NLRA rights,\nthat the Board can take action to vindicate those\nrights, and that this lack of knowledge stands in the\nway of employees’ effectively exercising their\nrights. Peter D. DeChiara, ‘‘The Right to Know: An\nArgument for Informing Employees of Their Rights\nunder the National Labor Relations Act,’’ 32 Harv.\nJ. on Legis. 431, 433-434 (1995); Charles J. Morris,\n\nThe Board suggested a number of\nreasons why such a knowledge gap\ncould exist—the low percentage of\nemployees who are represented by\nunions, and thus lack an important\nsource of information about NLRA\nrights; the increasing proportion of\nimmigrants in the work force, who are\nunlikely to be familiar with their\nworkplace rights; and lack of\ninformation about labor law and labor\nrelations on the part of high school\nstudents who are about to enter the\nlabor force.*\n\nOf greatest concern to the Board,\nhowever, is the fact that, except in very\nlimited circumstances, no one is\nrequired to inform employees of their\nNLRA rights.5 The Board is almost\nunique among agencies and\ndepartments administering major\n\n“Renaissance at the NLRB—Opportunity and\nProspect for Non-Legislative Procedural Reform at\nthe Labor Board,” 23 Stetson L. Rev. 101, 107\n(1993); Morris, “NLRB Protection in the Nonunion\nWorkplace: A Glimpse at a General Theory of\nSection 7 Conduct,” 137 U. Pa. L. Rev. 1673, 1675-\n1676 (1989). 75 FR at 80411.\n\n4 Id.\n\n5 The Board requires that employees be notified\nof their NLRA rights in only the following narrow\ncircumstances: (1) For the three working days\nbefore a Board-conducted representation election,\nthe employer is required to post a notice of election\nincluding a brief description of employee rights; see\n29 CFR 103.20. (2) When an employer or a union\nhas been found to have violated employee rights\nunder the NLRA, it is required to post a notice\ncontaining a brief summary of those rights. (3)\nBefore a union may seek to obligate newly hired\nnonmember employees to pay dues and fees under\na union-security clause, it must inform them of\ntheir right under NLRB v. General Motors, 373 U.S.\n734 (1963), and Communications Workers v. Beck,\n487 U.S. 735 (1988), to be or remain nonmembers\nand that nonmembers have the right to object to\npaying for union activities unrelated to the union’s\nduties as the bargaining representative and to obtain\na reduction in dues and fees of such activities.\nCalifornia Saw & Knife Works, 320 NLRB 224, 233\n(1995), enfd. sub nom. Machinists v. NLRB, 133\nF.3d 1012 (7th Cir. 1998), cert. denied sub nom.\nStrang v. NLRB, 525 U.S. 813 (1998). The same\nnotice must also be given to union members if they\ndid not receive it when they entered the bargaining\nunit.

(4) When an employer voluntarily\nrecognizes a union, the Board has required that the\nemployer must post a notice informing employees:\n(i) That the employer recognized the union on the\nbasis of evidence that it was designated by a\nmajority of the unit employees; (ii) the date of\nrecognition; (iii) that all employees, including those\nwho previously signed cards for the recognized\nunion, have the right to be represented by a labor\norganization of their choice, or no union at all; (iv)\nthat within 45 days of the date of the notice a\ndecertification or rival petition, supported by 30\npercent or more of the unit employees, may be filed\nwith the Board and will be processed to an election;\nand, (v) that ifno petition is filed within 45 days,\nthe recognition will not be subject to challenge for\na reasonable period to allow the employer and\nunion to negotiate a collective-bargaining\nagreement.
