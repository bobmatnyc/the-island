Specifically, 1) consumption is poised to rebound as the saving rate peaks; 2) capex should\naccelerate in response to the improving demand outlook, deepening supply-side constraints, and \"low-for-\nlonger\" real rates; and 3) increased efforts by policymakers to accelerate income redistribution could push up\nthe velocity of money at the margin, helping to reflate the economy.\n\nBiggest risk factor: US policy uncertainty\n\nExternal developments pose the greatest risk to our forecasts, chief among them US policy uncertainty. The\ndownside scenario for Japan is a combination of rising US protectionism, sliding global trade, and a stronger\nyen, which could reduce 2017 growth to zero. The Trump presidency may increase pressure on Japan to\nachieve greater military self-reliance, boosting defense spending. There will also be greater incentives to\ndeepen economic and trade linkages with key regional players, such as China and Russia.\n\nChart 1: We think consensus is underestimating the strength of medium-term GDP and inflation\n\n2.0\n\nReal GDP YoY 4 4 CPlextreshfood YoY gg\noe a\n08\n0.0\nO05\n\nOvT6 OTE ove Cv1é OvTT ov1s\nBBofAML | Consensus (Bloonberg, as of 1& Now 2076)\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch forecasts, Bloomberg\n\nIzumi Devalier ©\nJapan Economist\nMerrill Lynch (Japan)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014402",
