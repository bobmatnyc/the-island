  "text": "Afpak — a mess\n\nObama has made no big mistakes in a revolutionary environment, but no victories\neither. No big bets other than surge in Afghan — which we lost; and killing Osama\nwhich we won. Obama’s approach is to take no risk, increment into a situation and\nhedge the position. No big bets. Maybe that’s right for these times but look at\nTruman with Marshall Plan; in *73 ME war Nixon used it to push Soviets out of\nME which gave us 30 years of dominance in ME. Bush (I) pushed to integrate\nGermany and Poland into NATO — huge bet and we won. Big bets come from the\ntop down. Not interagency BS. Before Malta summit, Reagan WH had given him\n18 initiatives to raise with Gorbachev. 2 days before summit, Reagan decided to\npass them by cabinet. Held cabinet meeting and every time an idea was surfaced,\nthe relevant cabinet member tried to kill it until it had been vetted by his\nbureaucracy. After three went this way, Reagan ended the meeting. Presidents\nmake big bets, administrations don’t. Here are some ideas:\n\n1. Iran — next president will be forced to make a big bet.\n\n2. Egypt — Importnace is clear. Our response has been pitiful. Small and\nirrelevant. Obama is letting his team over analize and organizational\ndynamics are pushing safe and no risk options. Only a president can\novercome organizational dynamics. Not all big bets are worth taking.\n\n3. Syria — Pattern has been to hesitate and equivocate. Some of our allies are\njoking that we will implement a no fly zone ... 10 feet at a time. We should\nbreak the Syria - Iran link with the full force of the US. Slow and cautious\nwill be damaging to our interests in Syria and Iran.\n\n4. KSA we should consider guarantying their integrity.\n\n5. Iraq — NAM bring it towards a break up. Bet on Alawi\n\n6. ME peace process — we need a big bet.\n\nIncrementalism won’t work. Activities threaten our vital interests. No big bets can\nsucceed if the US has a policy of leading from behind.\n\nStrobe Talbott\n\nBig bets should be hedged and designed to change when circumstances change on\nthe ground. Obama doctrine is not concise and that’s deliberate and smart in a very\ndynamic regions. Obama is an anti-doctrine doctrine.\n\nScowcroft\n\nWe need a central strategy. Currently we are all tactics and no strategy. Pivot to\nAsia, responses to EU financial crisis etc are all tactics. The Westphalian structure\nis under attack. Industrialization led to Westphalian state. Globalization is creating\n\n14\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025810",
