To be clear, I believe that both partners have responsibilities in a BDSM\nsituation, but I also believe that the dominant partner especially must be careful and\nresponsive. I hope that this is a theme in all my work. I really don't ever want to\nencourage people to blame the victim. However, I think it's undeniable that submissive\npartners need a sense of themselves, as well as internal strength and resources, to do\nBDSM -- especially very intense BDSM. The goal of this post was to start figuring out\nwhat that means.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nA while back, I attended a workshop run by educator Sarah Sloane on the topic of BDSM\nand abuse. Sarah centered her workshop on a maxim that I have hereby stolen: \"Start\nfrom a position of strength, and seek strength in the end.\"\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot in terms of not just polyamory and BDSM, but sex in\ngeneral. All types of sexuality are more pleasurable for some people, and less pleasurable\nfor others; emotionally easier for some people, and more difficult for others. I have zero\ninterest in telling other people how they \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" deal with their sexuality,\nas long as what they're doing is consensual. I want to say right now that nothing I'm about\nto write is intended to tell others how they \"should\" or \"shouldn't\" do S&M; it's just my\nown thoughts on how I might choose and process my experiences.\n\nI can certainly consent to whatever, even if that thing is problematic or scary or difficult\nor complicated -- I can consent. The thing is, if I want to get something amazing and\npositive out of my experiences, I think it's good to start from a position of strength.\n\nIn some ways this is clear. For example, I think that being with a partner who genuinely\nwants me to have a good experience, who really cares about me, and who wants to see\nme again -- that's almost always a position of strength. Even if I have fairly intense, dark\nS&M encounters with that person, I can feel confident that he'll treat me with respect;\nthat he'll give me space and lend me strength for emotional processing afterwards.\n\nAlso, knowing what I want is a position of strength; understanding how I feel is a\nposition of strength. Being able to recognize my emotional difficulties, hiccups, triggers\nand landmines is a position of strength. Knowing for sure that I can call my safeword, if\nnecessary, is a position of strength. On a physical level, I prefer to do S&M when my\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018632",
