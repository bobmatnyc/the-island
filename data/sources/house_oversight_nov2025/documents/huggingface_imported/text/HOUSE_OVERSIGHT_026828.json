There are no indications yet that ISIS has changed its\napproach here. It encourages radicalization and lone wolf attacks but has not mounted direct attacks. But the\nMetrojet bombing has resulted in a stepped up global effort to secure American airlines. So too, targeting of\nAmerican institutions/events — it is unlikely a coincidence that an American band was playing at the site of the largest\ncausalities in Paris -- seems highly probable. This applies equally to American bases and facilities overseas, including\n\nembassies.\n\n© The Scowcroft Group\nWARNING: This document and the information contained herein are intended only for the personal and confidential\nuse of clients of The Scowcroft Group.
