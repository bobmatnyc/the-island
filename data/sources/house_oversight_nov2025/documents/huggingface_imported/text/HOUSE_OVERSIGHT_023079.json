Financials &\nReal Estate is brought back (given the tax is mandatory and will be paid either way) and\n50% is used on buybacks (~3% of S&P 500 market cap), this could add ~$4 to S&P 500\nEPS. And if 80% (~4% of market cap) were used on buybacks, similar to NBER’s\nestimate of what occurred following the 2004 tax holiday, this could add $6 to EPS.\n(The difference between the Trump and Blueprint tax rates is small, leading to only\ncents in index EPS.) If one assumed companies only brought half of their offshore cash\nhome immediately, even though the full amount was taxed, these benefits would be cut\nin half.\n\nNote that buyback programs may span several years, which could spread out some of\nthe EPS benefit below. But if one assumes a buyback is fully executed in Year 1, this\nprovides a one-time boost to EPS growth and a recurring benefit to future EPS given a\npermanently lower share count.\n\nTable 11: Impact to S&P 500 EPS based on various buyback scenarios\n\n% used for buybacks: 10% 20% 30% 40%) 50%) 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\nTrump (10% tax) 1% 1% 2% 2% 3% 3% 4% 4% 5% 6%\nBlueprint (8.75% tax) 1% 1% 2% 2% 3% 3% 4% 5% 5% 6%\nBenefit to 2017 EPS: $1 $1 $2 $3 $4 $4 $5 $67 $7\nBenefit to 2018 EPS: $1 $1 $2 $3 $4 $5 = $5 $67 $8\n\nAssumes 100% of overseas cash is brought back (given tax is mandatary)\nSource: FactSet, Bloomberg, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, BofA Merrill Lynch US Equity & US Quant Strategy\n\nBelow we calculate the potential impact to sectors’ EPS under various buyback\nscenarios.
