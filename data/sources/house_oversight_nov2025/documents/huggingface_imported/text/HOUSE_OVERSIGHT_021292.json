  "text": "isolated, disconnected, and like one\ndoesn’t belong.\n\nIn terms of emotional health, the\nprospect for lonely people is increasing\nmisery, at least over the short term.\nLoneliness and depressed affect tend to\nbe thought of as synonymous, but the\ntwo are conceptually and empirically\ndistinct. If loneliness and depression\nwere synonymous, increases in\nloneliness would have no capacity to\npredict increases in depressive\nsymptoms because increases in one\nwould be exactly paralleled by increases\nin the other. Instead, longitudinal data\nhave shown that loneliness predicts an\nincrease in depressive symptoms but\ndepressive symptoms do not predict an\nincrease in loneliness over a one-year\ninterval.’ Importantly, the influence of\nloneliness on depressive symptoms was\nnot attributable to fewer social\nconnections, general negativity, stress,\nor poor social support. These data\nsuggest that the relevant intervention\ntarget is loneliness, and that modifying\nthe cognitions, perceptions, and\nexpectations of the lonely individual\ncould help improve quality of life and\noverall well-being.\n\nSocial Connectedness: Invisible Forces\nMade Visible\n\nAt this juncture, having become\nacquainted with the burden of loneliness,\nit is helpful to remember that most\npeople, most of the time, feel socially\nconnected. They derive satisfaction and\nmeaning from their social relationships\nand this makes them happier and more\nsatisfied with life. Interestingly,\nhappiness leads to higher levels of\nrelationship satisfaction, indicating that\nhappiness and relationship satisfaction\nfeed forward to foster spirals of\nincreasing happiness and relationship\nsatisfaction. The general positivity that\n\n?\n\nPage |46\n\nensues from happiness is also apparent\nin the effects of happiness on income.\nHappiness predicted increases in\nhousehold income over a 2-year period\nin middle-aged adults. However,\nrelationship satisfaction also predicted\nincreases in household income over this\ntime period and, remarkably,\nrelationship satisfaction helped to\nexplain the effect of happiness on\nincome. It seems that happy people\nexperience increases in income in part\nbecause of the general good will that\nsurrounds the socially contented\nindividual and that elicits tangible and\nintangible positivity from others.\n\nIt is perhaps precisely because\nmost people feel socially connected and\nhappy that we take for granted the\ninvisible force of social connectedness\nand its stabilizing and nurturing\ninfluence in all aspects of life. Only in\nits absence do we begin to comprehend\nits power. Western notions of the\nautonomous individual notwithstanding,\nhuman beings are “wired” for social\nconnections and need social bonds to\nfeel safe, valued, motivated, and\ncompetent.'* Among the lamentations\nexpressed by some in Western societies\nis a concern that our autonomy and\nindependence come at the expense of\nmeaningful social relationships and a\nsense of belonging to a larger social unit.\nFamily members are no longer\nobligatorily part of our social\ncommunity, while Facebook friends,\nsome of whom we know only through\nelectronic media, are deemed essential to\nfulfilling our need for a sense of\nconnectedness and belonging.’* The\nbroadening of our social worlds has not\nbeen accompanied by maintenance,\nmuch less improvement, of the quality of\nour social relationships.
