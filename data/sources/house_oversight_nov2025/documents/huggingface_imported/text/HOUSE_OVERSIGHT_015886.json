When mathematicians use the letters ‘PM’, they are\nusually referring to Russell and Whitehead’s Principia Mathematica\nrather than the afternoon.\n\nHilbert’s Problems\nIn 1900, while Russell and Whitehead were in full flow writing out\ntheir rules, David Hilbert was invited to deliver the annual lecture at\nthe International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris. He asked a\nmathematician friend what subject he should pick for the talk and, in\na moment of inspiration, the friend suggested laying out a vision for\nthe future of mathematics. Rather than tell people how wonderful\nmathematicians were, and why their discipline was the pinnacle of\nhuman scientific endeavor, why not try modesty and list all the problems\non which they were stumped? Hilbert liked the idea and devoted his\ntalk to all the problems he thought mathematicians would solve in the\n20\" century. Hilbert’s Problems were simply an intellectual challenge.\nHe offered no prizes. At the turn of the 21* century, the Clay Institute\ncreated the Millennium Prizes for solving the most important modern\nmathematical problems. Each solution wins a prize of a million dollars!\nThere are 23 numbered Hilbert Problems in all: ten in the original\nlecture and a further 13 in the written transcript. In 1928, he clarified\nthe 2™ and 10\" problems, refining them into three distinct questions: Is\nmathematics consistent, complete and decidable? Ironically this means\nthat Hilbert’s 23 problems actually number 24! The most important\nHilbert questions where these last three. They ask whether Russell\nand Whitehead would be successful — can you write out all the rules\nof mathematics and then simply calculate the answer to any problem\nor derive any proof. This is known as the Decision Problem. Can you\nmechanically decide any mathematical question without doubt? To\nexplain Hilbert’s Problems, I need to define mathematics properly.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015886",
