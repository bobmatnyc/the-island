It has not yet seen the\nsecond surface.\n\nThe photon travels on and reaches the second surface. It needs to\nmake a decision: Shall I reflect or not? It cannot decide that it should\nhave been reflected from the first surface because it is already at the\nsecond surface; it’s too late.\n\nThe photon is stuck. It cannot make the decision at the first surface\nbecause that is too early, nor at the second surface because that is too late.\nThe glass surfaces cannot be the source of the decision.\n\nThis leaves only one remaining option: I, the observer, tell the\nphoton what to do. The word ‘tell’ is probably a little strong. Sadly, I am\nnot that powerful. All I can do is tell the photon to make up its mind.\nWhen the photon reaches my eye, it must decide what happened to it\nalong the journey, but this decision appears purely random and I have\nno effect upon it. The best way physicists have found to describe what is\ngoing on is to say particles, such as a photons, behave according to a wave\nfunction. Particles oscillate between all the possible options available to\nthem and when we take a measurement this freezes the oscillations and\ngives a single result.\n\nWhere exactly is the measurement made? At my eye when the\nphoton is refracted by the lens, when the photon enters the aqueous\nhumor, or perhaps as it interacts with the rods and cones in the retina.\nMaybe we must wait until the detection of the photon is converted into\nan electrical impulse in the optic nerve or even the point at which my\nhuman consciousness perceives it.\n\nThis prompted the physicist John Bell to ask a slightly tongue-\nin-cheek question, “Was the world wave function waiting to jump for\nthousands of millions of years until single-celled creatures appeared? Or,\ndid it have to wait a little longer for some more highly qualified measurer\n— with a Ph.D.?” You see his point. Where is the bar set that defines a\nmeasurement?\n\nOne of the most extreme answers to Bell's question is the strong\nanthropic principle. It argues humans — or at least sentient beings,\nperhaps even cats — cause the Universe to exist. The Universe bubbles\nalong in a state of superposition with every possible event occurring and\nbifurcating until an observer emerges in one of the branches and the\nwhole edifice collapses to that state. It is not clear if this produces many\nconcurrent universes or if the first universe with a sentient being wins!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016012",
