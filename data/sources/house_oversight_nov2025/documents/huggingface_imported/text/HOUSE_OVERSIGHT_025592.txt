Caroline Kennedy Selling 93 Acres on Martha’s Vineyard

Caroline Kennedy, the only surviving child of the late President John F. Kennedy, listed for sale about 90 acres
of land in Martha’s Vineyard, a resort island off the Massachusetts coast.

Two waterfront parcels in the town of Aquinnah are on the market -- a 39.5-acre (16-hectare) property
available for $20 million, and a 53.5-acre piece for $25 million, according to the listings for 6 Red Gate Farm
and 8 Red Gate Farm.

“An exclusive waterfront property with incredible views of Squibnocket Pond, with further views over
towering sand dunes to the Atlantic Ocean,” the listing for 6 Red Gate Farm reads. “Plenty of privacy with
varied topography and easy pond access. Yours to create a marvelous estate.”

The land is part of a 366-acre stretch that has been private since Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis bought it in 1978,
said John O’Connell, broker and owner of Vineyard Realty Group in Edgartown, Massachusetts.

The property is “a piece of the island that very few people have seen,” said O’Connell, who isn’t involved in
the sale.

Corporate records for Red Gate Farm LLC, which owns the land, lists Edwin A. Schlossberg as the person
responsible for the parcels. He is the husband of Caroline Kennedy, who is expected to be Obama’s choice as
the next U.S. ambassador to Japan.
