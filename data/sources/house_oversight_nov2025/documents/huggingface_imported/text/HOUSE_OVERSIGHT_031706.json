In recent years, the Republican Party has decided to make Israel a wedge issue. In order to garner\nmore Jewish (and evangelical) votes and money, the G.O.P. decided to “out-pro-Israel” the Democrats by being\neven more unquestioning of Israel. This arms race has pulled the Democratic Party to the right on the Middle\nEast and has basically forced the Obama team to shut down the peace process and drop any demands that Israel\nfreeze settlements. This, in turn, has created a culture in Washington where State Department officials, not to\nmention politicians, are reluctant to even state publicly what is U.S. policy — that settlements are “an obstacle\nto peace” — for fear of being denounced as anti-Israel.\n\nAdd on top of that, the increasing role of money in U.S. politics and the importance of single donors who can\nwrite megachecks to “super PACs” — and the fact that the main Israel lobby, Aipac, has made itself the feared\narbiter of which lawmakers are “pro” and which are “anti-Israel” and, therefore, who should get donations and\nwho should not — and you have a situation in which there are almost no brakes, no red lights, around Israel\ncoming from America anymore. No wonder settlers now boast on op-ed pages that the game Is over, they’ve\nwon, the West Bank will remain with Israel forever — and they don’t care what absorbing all of its Palestinians\nwill mean for Israel’s future as a Jewish democracy.\n\nIt is into this environment that Romney wandered to add more pandering and to declare how he will be so much\nnicer to Israel than big, bad Obama. This is a canard. On what matters to Israel’s survival — advanced\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031706",
