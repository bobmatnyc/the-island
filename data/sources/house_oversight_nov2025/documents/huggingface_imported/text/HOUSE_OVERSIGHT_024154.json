  "text": "Emerging market equities\n\nMSCI EM (27 June): 913 (last month: 907)\nUBS View MSCI EM 6-month target: 1,000\n¢ Currency weakness hurt emerging market (EM) equity performance in US-dollar terms year-to-date. We\nexpect EM FX to appreciate against the USD from current levels over a six-month horizon.\ne As expected, China has started to ease monetary policy. We believe there is also room to do more on the\nfiscal side, helping to support China's economic growth outlook for the second half of 2012 and into 2013.\nThe 2Q GDP numbers are expected to represent the low point in the current cycle.\n¢ Given the above, in our base case, we see scope for some multiple expansion for the MSCI EM Index,\nfrom the current 10.3x realized price-to-earnings ratio to closer to 11x over the next six months. We expect\nearnings growth of around 10% over the next 12 months.\n¢ Within EM, we believe that Asia is best positioned for economic growth in the second half of 2012. In\nemerging Asia, we prefer China. In Latin America, we prefer Brazil and Mexico. Central and Eastern\nEurope remains the most vulnerable region, and we remain neutral on Russia.\n4 Positive scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 1,190\ne The outlook for the global economy improves, boosting EM's ability to grow more strongly in 2013.\nStronger economic growth leads to earnings growth of 15%. Investor confidence improves, leading to a\nbetter P/E multiple of 12.5x trailing earnings. More cyclical Korea and Taiwan would benefit.\n\n& Negative scenario MSCI EM (6-month target): 730\n\ne Serious negative developments (e.g. a further deterioration of the Eurozone crisis, the US fiscal cliff, or a\nChinese hard landing) hit trade and thus the economic prospects of emerging markets. In this case, we\nwould expect a 25% decline in earnings. More defensive Malaysia would do better, whereas more cyclical\nKorea and Taiwan would underperform. We assume, however, that the market would also be expecting\nsome recovery in earnings for 2013, helping the P/E multiple to recover to 9.5x trailing earnings.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nEmerging market\n\nInvestors are trying to figure out which emerging market central banks still have\nmonetary policy\n\nroom to ease monetary policy and where rates may be heading up. Inflation\ndata due for Russia (4-9 July), Brazil (7 July), China (9 July), Mexico (9\nJuly), India (13 July), South Africa (18 July).\n\nOil prices & EM FX\n\n36 UBS\n\nof earlier rises, but the exchange rate matters, too.\n\nRecent declines in oil prices are helping to reverse some of the inflationary impact\n\nPreference: overweight\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne In Asia, we expect Chinese equities to\nbenefit as the Chinese economy avoids a\nhard landing. In Latin America, we prefer\nBrazil and Mexico.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne Structural factors (e.g. stronger fiscal\nposition, more favorable demographics)\nshould continue to support stronger\neconomic growth than in the developed\neconomies.\n\n¢ Strategically, we would advise a tilt in EM\nportfolios toward cash-rich and faster-\ngrowing Asia.\n\nEmerging market country preferences\n\nCurrent most Current least\npreferred markets preferred markets\n\nBrazil Hungary\nChina Indonesia\nMexico Poland\n\nWe currently have a neutral view on the\nremaining emerging equity markets in the\nMSCI EM index.\n\nFor further information please contact CIO asset class specialist Costa Vayenas, costa.vayenas@ubs.com!®\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024154",
