  "text": "generally civil, and often friendly contacts, Israelis had with Palestinians at the\ntime. The local population had, after all, been under other occupation powers\nbefore 1967: Jordan in the West Bank, and Egypt in Gaza. Assuming our\nadministration was less onerous, most Israelis believed a way to coexist could\nbe found. And that sooner or later, there would be a land-for-peace agreement\nand we would withdraw from at least most of the territory. But as the years\npassed, with no sign of a willingness by the PLO to consider any kind of peace\ntalks, we made the cardinal error of assuming the occupation was sustainable.\nYes, there might be periods of violence, but nothing that a combination of\npolitical resolve, arrests, detention and, where necessary, military force could\nnot hold in check. For us, and certainly for me, the Palestinians became\nessentially a security issue. As one of Israel’s finest novelists, David Grossman,\nwould lay bare in a bestselling book of reportage called The Yellow Wind, about\na year into the intifada, we had ceased to see the human effects of 20 years of\noccupation, not only on the Palestinians but on Israeli society as well.\n\nYet the power of Professor Shamir’s presentation lay not so much 1n its\nnovelty as its succinctness, clarity and, above all, its timing. The rioting had\nalready gone on for longer than any of us had expected. It seemed to be\ngathering strength. But until our meeting, we were still looking at it essentially\nas a civil disturbance. 7hat was what began to change, for all of us.\n\nWhat didn’t change was the need to try to bring the violence to an end. Dan\nimmediately put me in charge of looking for alternatives to live ammunition. I\nbegan with our own research and development engineers. We also asked military\nattachés in our embassies to talk to law-enforcement agencies, academics, or\nanyone else with knowledge of non-lethal methods of crowd control overseas.\nSome of the more far-flung examples seemed promising, at least until further\ninvestigation. South Korea had years of experience in confronting student\nprotests — generally, though not always, managing to avoid fatalities. But it\nturned out this typically involved sending in serried rows of up to 25,000 riot\npolice against a few thousand campus protesters. Besides the fact we’d have\nneeded an army the size of the Americans’ to field enough soldiers, it was absurd\nto imagine dealing with dozens of far-flung confrontations on any given day with\nparade-ground formations of troops.\n\nWe looked at anything that seemed it might work. In the early stages, most\nof the attacks involved rocks and bottles. Our R&D engineers developed a Jeep-\nmounted “gravel gun” that fired stones at a distance of up to 250 feet. They\ncould cause injuries, but weren’t lethal. We acquired launchers for pepper spray\n\n228\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028076",
