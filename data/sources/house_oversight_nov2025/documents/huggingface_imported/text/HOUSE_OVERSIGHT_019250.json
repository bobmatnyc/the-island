  "text": "BREAKING DOWN DEMOCRACY: Goals, Strategies, and Methods of Modern Authoritarians\n\nFurthermore, because the population now has greater\naccess to foreign sources of news and entertain-\nment, regimes must grapple with the complex task of\nmonopolizing the political discourse in ways that are\nfar more convincing and compelling than the robotic\npronouncements that played such a crucial part in\ncommunism's loss of credibility.\n\nAs is the case with so much of modern authoritarian\npractice, Russia has taken the lead in developing strat-\negies and methods of media domination. The system\nbuilt under Vladimir Putin is defined by the following\ncharacteristics:\n\n1. Control over the commanding heights of the\nmedia: Among Putin's first goals as president\nwas securing domination of the most influential\nmedia—the national television stations. They\nhad been controlled by various oligarchs, who\nused the outlets to promote their personal and\npolitical interests. While the resulting journalism\nwas hardly objective and independent, Russian\ntelevision and Russian media generally were no-\ntable for their liveliness and diversity during the\npresidency of Boris Yeltsin. All did not sing out\nof the same hymnal, and most influential outlets\nreflected a variety of opinions about government\npolicies, including the Kremlin's conduct of the\nwar in Chechnya.\n\nPutin moved quickly to change these conditions.\nHe reorganized and exerted tighter political con-\ntrol over state-owned television stations, brought\nothers under indirect state control, and ensured\nthat most of the remainder fell into the hands\n\nof loyal businessmen. Likewise, a number of the\ncountn/’s leading newspapers and journals were\nbought by cronies of the leadership. The era of\nmedia diversity came to an abrupt end.’\n\n2. Distortion of coverage on sensitive topics: Un-\nlike in communist times, the media do provide\nindependent coverage of topics that the Kremlin\nconsiders less politically relevant. However,\nsome normally apolitical topics can take ona\nhighly political meaning. For example, coverage\nof the penalties meted out to Russian Olympic\nathletes for systematic doping reflected the\nleadership's position that the scandal was a\nproduct of American machinations.’\n\n3. Shrinking gap between offline and online me-\ndia: For much of Putin's tenure, the internet\n\nremained lightly regulated in comparison with\nthe Kremlin's tight control over television and\nother mass media. However, Freedom House\nhas noted growing restrictions over the past\nseveral years, with a series of new laws, prosecu-\ntions, and ownership changes that have reduced\nthe Russian internet's freedom and diversity in\npractice.’\n\n. Asmall stable of independent outlets: A token\n\nnumber of media outlets are allowed to remain\nindependent at the sufferance of the Kremlin.\nThese include the newspaper Novaya Gazeta,\nthe indirectly state-owned radio station Ekho\nMoskvy, and a handful of internet-based news\nservices, some of which are forced to operate\nfrom neighboring countries. Coerced owner-\nship changes and other forms of pressure have\ngradually reduced the already tiny independent\nmedia sector in recent years. And the remaining\nindependent outlets have little reach, small audi-\nences, and at best modest impact on domestic\npolitics.\n\n. The ‘weaponization’ of information: While Putin\n\nhas used the press as a propaganda instrument\nthroughout his political career, it was after his\nthird term as president began in 2012 that the\nmedia were given a special, central role in de-\nmonizing Putin's critics, preparing the Russian\npeople for armed conflict in Ukraine and else-\nwhere, depicting Europe as morally corrupt, and\nattributing Russia's problems and setbacks to\nthe United States.* With the invasion of Ukraine\nin 2014, the world awakened to the return of\npropaganda as an instrument of warfare. This is\nnot just normal political spin or public diploma-\ncy, but sheer, raw propaganda that celiberately\ncrosses the line between interpretation of facts\nand outright mendacity. The aim is both to stir\nup belligerence at home and to isolate, confuse,\nand demoralize the enemy.°\n\n. The centralization of information policy: The\n\ncreation in 2013 of Rossiya Segodnya, an umbrel-\nla organization for Moscow's foreign news ser-\nvices, signaled the leadership's intention to use\ninformation in a more strategic way to advance\nthe country’s international objectives. Dmitry\nKiselyov, a controversial television presenter,\nwas named to head the new entity.® He actually\nembraces his identity as the Kremlin's chief\npropagandist, arguing that “Western” concepts\n\n16\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019250",
