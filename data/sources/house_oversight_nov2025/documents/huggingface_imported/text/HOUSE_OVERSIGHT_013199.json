Portrayals of typical heterarchical linkage\npatterns among natural language concepts are given in Figures 15.5 and 15.6. Just for fun,\nFigure 15.7 shows one person’s attempt to draw a heterarchical graph of the main concepts\nin one of Douglas Hofstadter’s books. Naturally, real concept heterarchies are far more large,\ncomplex and tangled than even this one.\n\nIn CogPrime, ECAN enforces heterarchy via building SymmetricHebbianLinks, and PLN\nby building SimilarityLinks, IntensionalSimilarityLinks and ExtensionalSimilarityLinks. Fur-\nthermore, these various link types reinforce each other. PLN control is guided by importance\nspreading, which follows Hebbian links, so that a heterarchical Hebbian network tends to cause\nPLN to explore the formation of links following the same paths as the heterarchical Hebbian-\nLinks. And importance can spread along logical links as well as explicit Hebbian links, so that\nthe existence of a heterarchical logical network will tend to cause the formation of additional\nheterarchical Hebbian links. Heterarchy reinforces itself in \"autopoietic attractor\" style even\nmore simply and directly than heterarchy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013199",
