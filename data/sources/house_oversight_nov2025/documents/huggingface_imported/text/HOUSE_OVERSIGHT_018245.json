  "text": "sensation alive to the pull of constant, instant connection. This Seventh Sense reacts\nto what none of our other senses can notice, to the subtle undercurrents of a\nnetworked age. That moment of first connection you once had - to a computer, a\nfriend, a fast-moving financial product, a miracle medical cure, an idea, a smashed\nup sound - is like the first time you looked at a Matisse painting or heard Beethoven\n(or Orbital). It switched on a new sensibility. But you have probably had - or will\nshortly - another moment. This is the instant a cold and creeping chill hits you,\nstarted by the uneasy sensation that something you've done has been recorded or\npredicted or watched and manipulated in some way you'd not quite imagined. That\nsome strange force from a great distance has slammed into your life. This feeling is\nthe sudden shudder of a bill come surprisingly due: You wanted to be connected?\nOkay, here’s the cost. And the addition on both sides of the ledger, the massive\nbenefits of our links and the rather terrible potential of those same threads, is still\nbeing settled. We can say at least that the sum of all the revolutions wrought by the\ninstant mingling of the world’s soon-to-be connected billions with each other and\nwith machine intelligence, biological innovation and the tremors of a globalizing\nworld will be, to use Master Nan’s word, “epochal.”\n\nMost of us find ourselves torn now. Not just between future and past; not merely\nbetween the habits and loves of a slower age and the ceaslesss promise of\nsomething fast and new. We are trapped, as well, between two groups. An older\ngeneration now in power, blind to the laws of networks and connection, uses old\nideas to battle problems of a connected age and makes them worse, ever faster.\nTerrorism. Financial chasms. Environmental imbalance. At the same time, an\nemergent class of powerful technologists fingers more influence than perhaps any\ngroup in history. Machines watch, learn, think and increasingly control nearly every\nelement of our lives. This digital-age group understands networks; but if they have\nideas about virtue, philosophy and justice, (mostly they don’t) these feel susbsumed\nby their confidence in networks and control. Each group pulls at the legacy of the\nEnlightenment - our liberty. And, so far, we’ve no way of defending ourselves. No\nnew instinct for life in this still unfathomable age of connection. The Seventh Sense\nis a feeling for just what constant connection means - and the start of (finally) a\nconfident knowledge of how to construct our future and protect ourselves against\nwhat is even now descending upon us. A consciouness exists in the world, Master\nNan would say. It extends over borders, across differences, between people. And it\nbecomes, on networks now, visible in new, powerful and hopeful ways.\n\nWhat I mean by a sensibility is really a kind of instinctive notion, a way to sense and\nthen use the energy flows of our age that hovers perhaps just below what the\nrational mind alone can tell. Master Nan used to recall a famous story from the 2500\nyear old Daoist masterpiece Zhuangzi, about the butcher who worked for a famous\nand powerful Duke. One day the Duke saw the butcher cutting meat, his blade\nsinging and moving with almost no effort. “Ah, this is marvelous. Imagine such\nmastery,’ the Duke said. “How have you achived this?” he asked. “What I follow is\nThe Way,” the butcher said, referring to the idea of a spiritual force, a natural energy\nwhich Daoisim tells us infuses everthing, from trees to the human heart. “When |\nstarted butchering, all I could see was parts of the ox itself. After three years, I could\n\n13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018245",
