IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

Cite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)

tain general jurisdiction over them, all
claims asserted against those individual
defendants are dismissed for lack of per-
sonal jurisdiction.

3. Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Jurisdic-
tional Discovery as to Privatbank’s
Investing Activities in the United
States

[37] Plaintiffs point out that Privat-
bank’s website and its 2001 Annual Report
state that Privatbank engages in transac-
tions involving securities issued in the
United States. (2001 Annual Report at 3,
attached to Affidavit of Frances E. Bivens
at Exhibit B). There is no allegation that
transactions are related to the claims as-
serted here. Accordingly, they are only
relevant to this Court’s determination of
whether the exercise of general jurisdic-
tion over Privatbank is warranted pursu-
ant to Rule 4(k)(@) for having such “con-
tinuous and systematic general business
contacts” with the United States. See
Aerogroup Intl, Inc., 956 F.Supp. at 489.

Because plaintiffs have identified a gen-
uine issue of jurisdictional fact, the ques-
tion of general jurisdiction cannot be re-
solved on the pleadings and affidavits
alone. Thus, plaintiffs are entitled to ju-
risdictional discovery regarding the extent
of defendant Privatbank’s general business
contacts with the United States in the
years 1992—1998, a period that includes
the relevant period in this action and five
preceding years. See In re Magnetic Au-
diotape Antitrust Litig., 334 F.3d at 207-
08; see also, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 84
F.3d at 569-70 (holding that the time peri-
od relevant for determining extent of a
defendant’s contacts for general jurisdic-
tion purpose should include a number of
years prior to the events giving rise to the
claims asserted).

IV. CONCLUSION

For the reasons set forth above, the
Sovereign defendants’ motion to dismiss is

granted in part and denied in part. Plain-
tiffs’ claims alleging takings in violation of
international law, promissory estoppel, eq-
uitable estoppel, and unjust enrichment—
counts seven, nine, and ten in the com-
plaint—are hereby dismissed as against
the Sovereign defendants. In addition, the
motion of individual defendants Horath
and Buchmann to dismiss the complaint
for lack of personal jurisdiction is granted
and all claims asserted against those de-
fendants are hereby dismissed.

Because this Court finds that an issue of
jurisdictional fact exists as to the existence
of general jurisdiction pursuant to Rule
4(k)(2) as to corporate defendant Privat-
bank, its motion to dismiss is denied with-
out prejudice to its renewal pending con-
clusion of jurisdictional discovery on that
issue,
