The focus should be on serious business and financial\njournalists who are more interested to hear your opinions on the world\neconomy than to probe tabloid headlines. Those editors and columnists |\ntend to single out are Gerald Baker and Thorold Barker at the Journal,\nLionel Barber and John Gapper at the Financial Times, Andrew Sorkin\nand Hugo Lindgren at the Times, John Micklethwait and Matthew Bishop\nat the Economist, Josh Tyrangiel at Businessweek, as well as a handful\nof international correspondents. Ideally, the first few encounters would be\nat dinners and events that we organize in New York and internationally,\nwhich could be followed by dinners at your house in due course.\n\n¢ International political circles: Much more is to be gained by increasing\nyour profile among the international political class than the domestic U.S.\npolitical class. The global nature of your business, the importance of the\ngrowth markets and the puritanism of American politics are good reasons\nfor this. In our view, you should be spending time with European, Middle\nEastern, Asian and Latin American political and business leaders — some\nof which you of course already do on a daily basis but in a concerted way\nthrough such gatherings as, the Ambrosetti Forum, the Abu Dhabi Media\nSummit, Bilderberg and the BRICS Summit. | see that you are part of the\nTrilateral Commission and this is in a similar vein. The advantage offered\nby these gatherings over private meetings is that it demonstrates vividly\nto all the other opinion leaders the unique position you occupy among the\ninternational business elite.\n\nScience and technology\n\nThe passion and commitment you have for supporting scientific and technological\nresearch is extremely helpful in two ways. First, when spending time with editors\nand columnists, it is important to focus their attention on areas of your choice, not\ntheirs. Not only is your funding of these disciplines an interesting subject, but the\nspecial rapport that you enjoy with a number of outstanding scientists. This helps\nto showcase your unique position, and acts as a powerful character reference, as\ndid the Alan Dershowitz quotes in your 2005 Vanity Fair profile.\n\nSecond, since it is intrinsically difficult for people to understand the nature of your\nbusiness, it is all the more important that there is an aspect of your life that is well\nunderstood and which can be proactively communicated. Philanthropy can be the\nvehicle for this, and your highly targeted philanthropy even more so, because the\nimpact is quantifiable. A lot can be accomplished with the science and technology\npress in the first instance, who are interested in the serious side to your work and\nare uninterested in the tabloid headlines.\n\nSome of the necessary steps are:\n¢ Take down the Jeffrey Epstein Science and Jeffrey Epstein Philanthropy\n\nwebsites, and build a new site from scratch which explains your interests,\nyour past funding, the scientists you support and the breakthroughs\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030427",
