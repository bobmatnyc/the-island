Within mass beauty, the prestige segment\ngrew 6%, accounting for almost $19 bn in revenue in 2018 according to NPD. If we\nextrapolate the 6% growth in prestige beauty out through 2020, that would result in\nsegment revenues surpassing $21 bn over the next two years.\n\nFigure 76 Total U.S. Beauty Is A ~$87 BN Industry Figure 77 Prestige Can Grow To Over $21 BN By 2020\nTotal U.S. Beauty Industry Sales ($ in bn) U.S. Prestige Beauty Industry Sales (S in bn)\n$100 ee §22.0\n684 I 621.4\n$80 671974 $21.0 I\n$65 I $19.9\n$59 $20.0 ]\n$60\n$19.0 $188 I\nI\n$40\n$18.0 ald I\n$20 $17.0 '\nI\nso $16.0 .\n2013. 2014. «2045. ««2016«= 2017-2018 2017 e018 ano 020k\nSource: Company Reports and Cowen and Company Source: NPD and Cowen and Company\n\nWe expect that CBD beauty will become more of a focus for consumers, as large-scale\nmanufacturers and retailers begin to roll out more products, which will presumably\ngenerate positive mix and result in a step-change in market share capture. As such, we\nbelieve that a ~1% share of the prestige market is achievable in 2019, doubling to 2% in\n2020, which would equate to over $400 mm in sales.
