  "text": "“Thank you for sharing this! | truly appreciate your thoughts here. |\nread about this woman's complaint last week, and the whole event turned\nmy stomach. What Tosh did was personally threatening, which is not\nOK. But even though | fall neatly into the feminist camp, | think your\noriginal joke is hilarious—within context, and coming from a comedian\nwhose philosophy | identify with. Color me conflicted.”\n\n| think that kind of conflict is healthy. And then there was Louis\nC.K.’ s appearance on 7he Daily Show. This is what he told Jon Stewart\nbetween interruptions:\n\n“If this [controversy about Tosh] is like a fight between comedians\nand bloggers--hyperbole and garbage comes out of those two places, just\nuneducated, unfettered--it' s also a fight between comedians and\nfeminists, because they’ re natural enemies, because, stereotypically\nspeaking, feminists can’ t take a joke, and on the other side, comedians\ncan’ t take criticism. Comedians are big pussies. So to one side you say,\n\n‘If you don’ t like a joke, stay out of the comedy clubs.’ To the other\nside you say, ‘If you don’ t like criticism, stop Googling yourself every\nten seconds, because nobody’ s making you read it.’ It’ s positive. To\n\nme, all dialogue is positive. | think you should listen.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019100",
