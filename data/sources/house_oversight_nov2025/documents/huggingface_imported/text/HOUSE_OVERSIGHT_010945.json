  "text": "too, but we became the specialists. Adaptation grades into innovation whenever it\nsomehow becomes a norm. That too happens with other creatures, but not as often\nor as lastingly. Their new norms almost always revert to the old ones. Our\n\ninnovations collect and accrue. That’s why growth is our history.\n\nIts costs are failure rates and learning curves. Many innovations are blind alleys, and\nmost others need shakedown runs. But we're stuck with those as the cost of being\nhuman. And we're stuck with them whether the result right now is growth or not.\nThey were our cost of survival during our million years as homo erectus, when the\narcheological record shows little overall change in the stone tools we made. Growth\nand lasting innovation picked up marginally with the emergence of Ancestral Eve\nand bigger brains about 200,000 years ago, and began accelerating about 50,000\nyears ago. Growth happened because the more or less constant cost of adaptation\nand innovation became less than the payoff. New ideas finally found traction at no\nadded cost. Mill’s idea was that more payoff in growth need not presuppose more\n\nsacrifce.\n\nDoes that mean that all we need for growth is new ideas and the courage to trust\nthem? Well, no. We still have to plow back depreciation as the cost of holding even.\nWe need practical savvy and patience too. Sometimes great new ideas must wait for\nan opening. That may be why our bigger brains showed little effect on the kinds of\ntools we made until about 50,000 years ago. And I will argue that innovations need\nlaws and customs that welcome them. Otherwise they will make a few bucks for the\nlocal warlord rather than wealth for the originator and the world. But what they\n\ndon’t need, say Mill and I and the data, is tighter belts.\n\nAdam Smith, in his Wealth of Nations published in 1776, proposed growth by belt\ntightening. Most tradition has agreed, with the proviso that new ideas must come\nfirst. Solow raised doubts about the role of consumption restraint, but stopped short\nof denying a need for it. Mill acknowledged both ways to grow. My charts and tables\nwill confirm that only the kind that troubled Solow has actually happened, in every\n\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010945",
