  "text": "“What the hell is going on?” I replied, in a mix of a shout and a whisper,\nsince I knew the convoy was getting closer. But within a minute, we spotted the\nlead Land Rover, which was soon past us on the way up to the ridge. It was\nfollowed by two large American cars, with the Syrian officers, and then a\ntrailing security vehicle. It was too late. I was fuming. The convoy had passed\nwithin a couple of yards of us, moving slowly because of the incline. But,\nregaining my composure, | realized we’d get another opportunity, when the\nofficers returned from their inspection visit. We now knew exactly how the\nconvoy was deployed, and with any luck, the security men would be less alert\nby the end of the day. Even better, it would be beginning to get dark, perfect\nconditions for the ambush.\n\nBut as we were waiting, Amit radioed me with a question from from Dado\nand Motta. “Where’s the armored car?” It’s still there, at the bottom of the road,\nI told them. “But there’s nothing it can do.” Bibi and his team had it in their\nsights. I considered not telling Amit what happened a few minutes later: a\nLebanese shepherd, with a half-dozen sheep, stumbled on us. One of Uzi’s men,\nfluent in Arabic, tied the startled man’s arms behind his back, scattered the\nsheep, and told him: “It’s fine. Another hour or so, we’ll be gone, and we’ll let\nyou go.” It turned out to be less than an hour. Forty-five minutes. During which,\nnot once but twice, Amit told us that Dado and Motta were worried: about the\narmored car and now about the shepherd. I assured him everything was fine.\nWe'd do the operation. The guys in the armored car would be helpless. If all\nwent well, they might not even know we’d intercepted the convoy. The\nshepherd, like us, was just waiting for it to be over so we could all go home.\nMinutes later, Amit called again. He told us the convoy was on its way down.\nBut barely 60 seconds later, he said: “It’s off. Don’t do it. Dado told me to\nrepeat it twice so you’d understand: do not do the operation.”\n\nWhen we got back to the command post, not only were Dado and Motta\nthere. Since Motta was within days of leaving to become Israel’s military\nattaché in Washington, they’d been joined by his successor as head of the\nnorthern command, Yitzhak Hofi. Three times, I suggested to Dado that we\nspeak without my officers present. I did not feel it was nght to have Uzi,\nMookie and Bibi hear me the generals how I felt. But Dado insisted there was\nno reason for them to leave.\n\n“This is a serious issue,” I said, trying to keep my emotions in check. “What\nhappened out there is unacceptable. An effective special-forces unit cannot\noperate this way. For the second time in a week, you’ve made us stop an\n\n130\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011601",
