It took me a long time to figure this out. I used to be very fond of the results-\nby-volume approach.\n\nBeing busy is most often used as a guise for avoiding the few critically important but uncomfortable\nactions. The options are almost limitless for creating “busyness”: You could call a few hundred\nunqualified sales leads, reorganize your Outlook contacts, walk across the office to request documents\nyou don’t really need, or fuss with your BlackBerry for a few hours when you should be prioritizing.\n\nIn fact, if you want to move up the ladder in most of corporate America, and assuming they don’t\nreally check what you are doing (let’s be honest), just run around the office holding a cell phone to your\nhead and carrying papers. Now, that is one busy employee! Give them a raise. Unfortunately for the NR,\nthis behavior won’t get you out of the office or put you on an airplane to Brazil. Bad dog. Hit yourself\nwith a newspaper and cut it out.\n\nAfter all, there is a far better option, and it will do more than simply increase your results—it will\nmultiply them. Believe it or not, it is not only possible to accomplish more by doing less, it is mandatory.\n\nEnter the world of elimination.\n\nHow You Will Use Productivity\n\nNw that you have defined what you want to do with your time, you have to free that time. The trick,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013839",
