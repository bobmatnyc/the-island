  "text": "In retrospect, given all the interruptions, I’m a little surprised that I managed\nto get through my university studies. My classmates helped. They were\nincredibly generous in going through with me what I’d missed, and sharing their\nnotes, whenever I returned for an extended stint of reserve duty. P’ve seen\ninterviews with university friends saying I was one of the top students in our\nclass. But that is more generous than true. It would be fairer to say I was a good\nstudent. Working hard in the final year, I did finish in the upper quarter of the\nclass, and several of my math and science professors strongly urged me to go on\nto graduate school.\n\nBut my mind was made up on returning to the army. And as I balanced my\nstudies with plans for the future during my final months, | still hadn’t given up\nhope that Nili would be there with me. When she returned from Paris, we had\nstarted seeing each other again. Whenever I could, I would take the bus down to\nTel Aviv and spend the weekend with her. Everything I’d loved about her since\nthat first meeting in the Airya, everything I valued in our relationship, was still\nthere. Yet so, too, were the doubts: whether she was ready to commit herself to\nsharing our lives together; and whether a kibbutznik like me could ever truly fit\nin to her 7el Avivi world. Shortly before Karameh, she’d invited me to a Friday-\nnight party with a group of her friends. It was the first time she was including\nme, as part of a couple, in her social circle. But almost from the moment we got\nthere, I felt out of place. For her, it was just another party, one of dozens she\nmust have been to since she was a teenager. But I immediately felt out of place.\nI didn’t drink. I couldn’t dance. I couldn’t help feeling like a wallflower, or an\nalien presence.\n\nNow, I decided there was no point in waiting and wondering. I borrowed a\nJeep from an army friend, with the idea that Nili and I could spend three or four\ndays together, driving south from Jerusalem into the Negev and the Judean\ndesert: to be alone, to talk, to see whether we actually had a future. I wrote her a\nnote, took the bus to Tel Aviv while she was at work, and dropped it through the\nletterbox. “J am going on this trip, into the desert,” it said. “Id love it if you\ncould come with me. I think it’s important for us.”\n\nI never heard back. I felt crushed, though I tried hard to tell myself it was\nbetter to know where we stood. Years later, she told me the envelope had ended\n\n102\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011573",
