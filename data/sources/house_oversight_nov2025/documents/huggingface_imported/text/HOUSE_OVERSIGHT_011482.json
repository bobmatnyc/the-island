  "text": "The problem for Israel, no matter who or what party is in government, is that\nthere are risks everywhere one looks, and they show every sign of getting more,\nnot less, serious.\n\nThe “Arab Spring” has morphed into an Islamic winter. National frontiers\nthat were put in place by British and French diplomats after the fall of the\nOttoman Empire are vanishing. Centuries-old conflicts between tribes and rival\nreligious communities have reignited. The old Cold War system of nations has\ngiven way to a world without a single geopolitical centre of gravity. Perhaps\nmost seriously, Iran seems determined to get nuclear weapons, and, in my view,\nmay succeed in doing so.\n\nWhere Israel is concerned, relations with our indisputably most important\nally, the United States, are more strained than at any time in decades.\nDiplomatic ties with Europe, our single largest trading partner, have been\ngrowing steadily worse. And the only real certainty is that anyone who tells you\nthat they know absolutely where things are heading next is lying. Just ask Hosni\nMubarak, who, despite having nearly half-a-million soldiers and security\noperatives at his disposal, was utterly blindsided, and very soon toppled and\nimprisoned, by an uprising that began with a sudden show of popular anger in\nCairo’s Tahrir Square.\n\nInternally as well, Israel faces dangers. Chief among them is the alarming\nerosion of the standards of civil discourse, amid the increasingly shrill, often\nhateful, divisions between left and right, secular and religious, rich and poor\nand, most seriously of all, Jews and Arabs. While we remain economically\nsuccessful, the fruits of our wealth are being ever more unevenly shared, and the\nprospects for continued growth constrained by the lack of any visible prospect\nof long-term peace.\n\nBibi Netanyahu, of course, knows all of this. Indeed, he has repeatedly\nspoken of the multiple threats Israel faces, not only in somber terms, but at\ntimes almost apocalyptically.\n\nThat works, politically. Politicians, not just in Israel but everywhere, know\nthat it is a lot easier to win elections on fear than on hope.\n\nYet my own prescription — learned, as this book recounts, from years on the\nbattlefield, then reinforced by my years in government — is that Israel must\nresist being guided by either of those alternatives. Not fear, certainly. But\nneither by simple, untempered hope. Though the stakes have become much\nhigher since my night flight back from Camp David nearly 15 years ago, our\n\n11\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011482",
