[jeevacation@gmail.com]\nSubject: Re:\n\nImportance: — High\n\nBannon's \"nationalist-populist\" platform is coherent, rational, and, apparently appealing to a great many people.\nI can't see why at this point he wouldn't want to use his world-stage stature to make an argument for it and to\nclaim leadership of it. What does he have to lose? What else is there, except to suck up to Trump, and get the\nchance to be manhandled by him again?\n\nOn Thu, Jan 18, 2018 at 8:54 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\nGreat.\nIm thrilled for you.

Have to keep reminding people that I am actually quite unpopular.\nApparently thing of the past--for now (excepting among a small circle of journalists). Ira Rosen, a 60 Minutes\nproducer and a friend of Bannon's, came with a message from SB: \"You own me a few million.\" Rosen also\nsays he believes SB now weighing the strategy of making a formal and public break with Trump. I can't get\ntogether today because I have to leave for DC at 11AM to speak to 800 book buyers (not to mention pre-\nsigning 800 books). Then tomorrow AM to LA to do Bill Maher show. Making money is hard work.\n\nOn Thu, Jan 18, 2018 at 7:38 AM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote:\nhow was it.? why dont you stop by today so we can script tomorrow. - assuming no change. . prefer no\ndetails on email\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
