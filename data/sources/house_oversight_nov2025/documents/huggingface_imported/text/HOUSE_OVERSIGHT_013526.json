  "text": "without presupposition, ecstatically aware and selfless, it is God’s gift realized, a\njoyfully awake and nonjudgmental empty state of transcendence. As we sit, we work\nat feeling this in the brain of the enigmatically smiling stone Buddha.\n\nThe externally inactive state of high internal activity, the Bhagavad-Gita’s\nformlessness in the world of form, inaction in the world of action, has a natural\nmathematical representation in the simultaneously expanding and contracting\nmotions of hyperbolic dynamics and its associated entropic descriptors. How can\nthis kind of formlessness equip us for almost instantaneous knowing? In a resting\nstate of uniform hyperbolicity that only looks like randomness, accurate impressions\nof others can arise quickly and from only a few data points of observation. In the\nlate 1960’s, University of California mathematician, Rufus Bowen, proved the now\nfamous shadow theorem. This says that in dynamical states of hyperbolicity, directly\nobservable on the screen in computer simulations, the first few points of the on-\ngoing wild dynamical dance that appears to jump randomly from here to there on\nthe computer screen, counter-intuitively will quickly outline the entire skeleton of its\nfuture global shape, its geometry, though more time of observation is required to\nrealize this structure in full detail. The contracting motions on the stable surface of\naction, called a manifold, “iron down” all the points onto the unstable manifold that\nserves to outline the shape of the attractor of all starting points. In such a system,\nobservation of just the first few points outline the whole. Intuition, anticipatory\nknowing and that which some call prophesy, may be expressions of the hyperbolic\nbrain’s mind doing dynamical shadowing.\n\nTo review briefly, hyperbolic brain flow is made up of three decomposable\ncomponents: (1) The apparently predictable one along the main road of the action,\ngoing straight ahead and round and round on a throughway called the center\nmanifold—analogous perhaps to what might be a sequentially logical development;\n(2) Intersecting the center manifold transversally is a field of influence moving the\naction away from the center manifold with out-of-the-box motion, exploring side\npaths of unpredictably new, creative possibility called the unstable manifold, we\nmight think about inspired risk-taking, impulsive associations in thought; (3) Another\n\ntransversally intersecting field of influence, which conservatively, rationally, “irons\n\n26\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013526",
