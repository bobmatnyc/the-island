  "text": "Faced with this crucial decision, Althea made her choice on the basis\nof pure whimsicality. She noticed a pair of pigeons on the window ledge.\nOne of them was waddling toward the other. “All right,” she said, “if\nthat dove walks over and pecks the other dove, then we w/// publish this.”\nThe pigeon continued strutting along the window ledge, but it stopped\nshort and didn’ t peck the other pigeon, so publication of “Jesus and the\nAdulteress” was postponed indefinitely.\n\nOf course, Dick Gregory continued to spread his diligent activism\nuntil he died. He was a loss to me, and to this country, and around the\n\nworld, but his powerful inspiration remains.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015397",
