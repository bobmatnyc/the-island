  "text": "Page 60 of 78\n2007 Utah L. Rev. 861, *945\n\nIn light of the statutory statement in /8 U.S.C. § 377/(d)(6) that nothing in the CVRA \"shall be construed to impair the\nprosecutorial discretion of the Attorney General,\" as well as the separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the\n\ngovernment's decision to terminate a prosecution, the Subcommittee was not persuaded that the rule should be amended to\nrequire the court to consider the victim's views on dismissal. When there is no public court proceeding, the victim's views will\nbe taken into account through the right to confer with the government under /8 U.S.C. § 3771(a)(5). 47!\n\nThe Advisory Committee's opening premise is clear enough - victims do indeed have \"great interest\" in whether charges are\ndismissed. But after this promising start, the Committee's logic is hard to track. The Advisory Committee seems to be of the\nview that, in situations where a court considers a motion to dismiss at a public proceeding, the victim would be heard. *7* Yet\nthe proposed Rule the Committee cites for this proposition - proposed Rule 60 +73 - is actually drafted so narrowly that the\nvictim would have no right to be heard on such a motion. 474\n\nIn situations where the court considered a motion to dismiss without a public proceeding, the Advisory Committee takes the\nview that the CVRA does not \"explicitly address\" the subject. This view assumes, of course, that the victim's right to fairness\ndoes not come into play when the prosecution moves to drop previously filed charges. This assumption is incorrect. Rule 48\nalready requires leave of court for a dismissal. In determining whether to grant leave, current case law requires the court to\nconsider whether dismissal is \"clearly contrary to manifest public interest.\" +7> The existing caselaw requires that the impact\non a victim be considered in addressing a motion to dismiss. A dismissal is \"clearly contrary to the public interest\" if the\nprosecutor appears to be motivated by animus toward the victim. 47° Under the command of the CVRA, the victim thus must\nbe treated with fairness when the dismissal motion is addressed, as my proposal provides.\n\n[*946] When the government files a motion to dismiss criminal charges involving a specific victim, the only way to protect\nthat victim's right to be treated fairly is to consider the victim's views on the dismissal. +77 To treat a person with \"fairness\" is\nconventionally understood as treating them \"justly\" and \"equitably.\". 478 A victim is not treated justly and equitably if her\nviews are never before the court.\n\nThe Advisory Committee also alludes vaguely to \"separation of powers issues raised by judicial review of the government's\ndecision to terminate a prosecution.\" Here the Advisory Committee may be stepping out of line and questioning the Supreme\nCourt. In 1944, the Court itself added the requirement to Rule 48 that prosecutors obtain leave of court before dismissing any\nindictment. *7? Thus, if there are separation of powers \"issues\" about judicial review of dismissals, they have existed for more\nthan half a century by virtue of specific Supreme Court action.\n\n471 CVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 20.\n\n472 Td. (\"When there is a public proceeding, the victim's right not to be excluded, and to be reasonably heard is provided for in Rule [60].\").\n\n473 Tn the subcommittee draft, the rule cited is actually numbered Rule 43.1. See CVRA Subcommittee Memo, supra note 66, at 20. Later,\nwithout any substantive change, Rule 43.1 was renumbered as Rule 60.\n\n474 See Proposed Amendments, supra note 71, R. 60, at 15-20 (giving victims a right to be heard only as to proceedings concerning \"release,\nplea, or sentencing\") (discussed at infra notes 524-539 and accompanying text).\n\n475, United States v.
