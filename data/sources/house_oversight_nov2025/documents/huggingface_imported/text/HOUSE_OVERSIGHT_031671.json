Warner\nMay 22, 2017\n\nPage 2\n\nthe witness.3 And, as courts have repeatedly held, the protection offered by the Fifth\nAmendment privilege extends to producing documents where the act of production itself is\ntestimonial in nature.\n\nThe context in which the Committee has called for General Flynn’s testimonial\nproduction of documents makes clear that he has more than a reasonable apprehension that any\ntestimony he provides could be used against him. Multiple Members of Congress have\ndemanded that he be investigated and even prosecuted. He is the target on nearly a daily basis of\noutrageous allegations, often attributed to anonymous sources in Congress or elsewhere in the\nUnited States Government, which, however fanciful on their face and unsubstantiated by\nevidence, feed the escalating public frenzy against him.4 Additionally, in the intervening time\nsince the Committee issued its subpoena, the Department of Justice has appointed a special\ncounsel to investigate these and related matters. This environment creates a “reasonable cause\nto apprehend danger,” giving rise to a constitutional right not to testify. A detailed explanation\nof the legal basis for respectfully declining to comply with the Committee’s requests follows\nbelow.5\n\nThe Fifth Amendment Privilege Bars Congress From Compelling A Witness to Provide\nTestimony Through The Act of Producing Documents\n\nThe Fifth Amendment protects an individual from being “compelled in any criminal case\nto be a witness against himself.” U.S. Const. amend. V. This privilege applies in congressional\ninvestigations. In Watkins v. United States, Chief Justice Warren stressed that “the\nconstitutional rights of witnesses will be respected by the Congress as they are in a court of\njustice. ... Witnesses cannot be compelled to give evidence against themselves.” 354 U.S. 178,\n187-88 (1957). The Supreme Court later held in United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 34\n(2000), that the right not to be compelled to give testimony against oneself applies as well to the\ncompelled production of documents that would be “testimonial” in nature. Specifically, the act\nof producing documents in response to a subpoena may have a “compelled testimonial aspect”\nwhen “the act of production itself may implicitly communicate statements of fact” that the\ndocuments “existed, were in his possession or control, and were authentic.” Id. at 36 (internal\nquotation marks omitted) (quoting United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, 613 & n.11 (1984)).\n\n3 Id.\n\n4 These include leaks that purport to describe classified briefings, documents, and intelligence\ncollection. Any actual leaks of classified information -- including reported leaks of signals\nintelligence -- constitute criminal offenses by government officials violating their duty to protect\nclassified information.\n\n5 General Flynn reserves the right to assert, in connection with the subpoena, any other privilege\nor protection provided by the Constitution, statute, or common law.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031671",
