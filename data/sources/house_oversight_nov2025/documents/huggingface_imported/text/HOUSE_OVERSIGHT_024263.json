How successful is such surveillance, and\nwill it continue to be effective as the public reacts by potentially adopting privacy-enhancing\ntools? How successful do we want it to be, and how might frameworks agreeable within\njurisdictions that embrace the rule of law be used or abused within those that do not?\n\nReadings:\n\ne David O’Brien, Matt Olsen, Bruce Schneier, and Jonathan Zittrain, et al. “Don’t Panic.\nMaking Progress on the ‘Going Dark’ Debate,” The Berkman Center for Internet &\nSociety at Harvard University (Feb 1, 2016)\nhttps://cyber.law.harvard.edu/pubrelease/dont-panic/Dont_Panic_ Making Progress on\nGoing Dark_Debate.pdf archived at https://perma.cc/NT9M-ELAG.\n\ne John Cassidy, “Lessons from Apple vs. The F.B.I.,” The New Yorker (March 29, 2016)\nhttp://Awww.newyorker.com/news/john-cassidy/lessons-from-apple-versus-the-f-b-i\narchived at https://perma.cc/282P-A7MS.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024263",
