  "text": "2014] CRIME VICTIMS’ RIGHTS 69\n\nEpstein spent much of the jail term on “work release” to his luxurious\noffice.*\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office did not tell Epstein’s victims about the\nnonprosecution agreement until well after it had taken effect. To the\ncontrary, even after the nonprosecution agreement had been signed, the\nOffice continued to tell the victims that the case was still “under\ninvestigation” and that they should be “patien[t].”*° When the victims\nlearned of the agreement, two of them (Jane Doe Number One and Jane\nDoe Number Two) filed suit in federal court under the Crime Victims’\nRights Act, arguing that the prosecutors had violated their CVRA right to\nconfer as well as their right to be treated fairly.*’ The victims contended\nthat prosecutors should have conferred with them about the nonprosecution\nagreement before it became final.\n\nIn response, the U.S. Attorney’s Office argued primarily that it was\nunder no obligation to extend the victims any rights under the CVRA. It\nwas the Government’s blunt position that “CVRA rights do not attach in the\nabsence of federal criminal charges filed by a federal prosecutor.”*8 In\nshort, the Government argued it was not required to confer in any way with\nthe victims, or even treat them fairly, because the CVRA was not yet in\nplay. The issue is thus squarely framed: Is the Government correct in its\nassertion that it has no CVRA obligations in cases like the Epstein case\nwhere federal prosecutors never lodged federal charges against a suspect?\nIn view of the CVRA’s prominence, resolution of this issue may shed\nimportant light on the nature of crime victims’ enactments and the breadth\nof the role that crime victims should have in the criminal justice process.\n\nII. THE CVRA’S APPLICATION BEFORE FORMAL CHARGES ARE FILED\n\nTo analyze the issue of whether the CVRA extends nghts to crime\nvictims before prosecutors have formally filed charges, it is useful to look at\nthe CVRA’s purposes, language, and judicial interpretations. This Part\nlooks at each of these three issues in turn.\n\n4\n\n> See Michele Dargan, Feds Say They Treated Epstein Victims Fairly, PaLm BEAcH\nDatLy NEws (Apr. 8, 2011, 7:23 PM), http://goo.gl/TGDed; Conchita Samoff, Billionaire\nPedophile Goes Free, DAILY BEAST (July 20, 2010, 7:05 PM), http://goo.g1/MSTi17.\n\n4° See Jane Doe Motion, supra note 40, at 14, 16 (intemal quotation marks and citations\nomitted).\n\n47 See Emergency Victim’s Petition for Enforcement of Crime Victim’s Rights Act, 18\nU.S.C.
