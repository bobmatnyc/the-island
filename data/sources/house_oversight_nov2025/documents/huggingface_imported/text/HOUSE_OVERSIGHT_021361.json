  "text": "Second, God must be\nexperienced in relationship. Such\nchurches invite congregants to\nexperience God in their imaginations as\na person. Again, this violates a basic\npsychological expectation: persons have\nfaces to observe and hands to shake.\nHuman relational interactions are based\non sensorial response. Churches like the\nVineyard explicitly suggest that one\nshould imagine a sensorial response\nfrom God and encouraged congregants\nto participate in a kind of let’s pretend\nplay in which God was present. The\npastor suggested one Sunday morning\nthat congregants should put out a second\ncup of coffee for God, and sit down with\nhim to chat. People went on “date night”\nwith God. They would get a sandwich,\nand sit down on park bench to talk with\nGod as they imagined his arm around\ntheir shoulders. They would ask God\ntruly trivial questions like what shirt they\nshould wear in the morning and what\nmovie he thought they would like. These\nbehaviors were clearly play-like. One\ncongregant remarked: “I definitely do\nthat. When I can’t decide what to wear.\nLike, God, what should I wear?” Then\nshe laughed. “And you know, then I kind\nof forget about the fact that I asked God.\nI think God cares about really, really\nlittle things in my life. I mean I know\nGod cares, but I don’t expect him to tell\nme what to wear. I’m like, Oh, I think\nI'll wear that and forget I even asked\nGod!” This invitation to play was C.S.\nLewis’ explicit contribution to twentieth\ncentury Christianity: “let us pretend to\nturn the pretense into a reality.” In\nchurches which encourage such play,\nheresy fades in importance. The pastors\nand the committed congregants worry\nabout “deadness,” not flawed imagining.\n\nThird, congregants must learn to\nrespond emotionally to God as if God is\n\n115\n\nPage\n\nreal. If God is real, a Christian (at least,\nthe modern evangelical Christian) should\nexperience the emotions that one would\nfeel if one were loved unconditionally.\nMost do not. It is, in fact, difficult for\nhumans to experience themselves as\nunconditionally loved because no matter\nhow warm and loving a parent may be,\nat some point the child is expected to\ncontrol his or her behavior and parental\nlove will becomes contingent. The task\nof feeling unconditionally loved imposes\nupon the congregant not only the burden\nof identifying and relating to an invisible\nbeing, but experiencing emotions in\nresponse to that being’s love which the\ncongregant rarely, if ever, truly\nexperiences. Congregants talk about the\nexperience of unconditional love as rare:\nthey speak of “those moments” when\none really feels God’s love.\n\nI was driving home from grocery\nshopping in the car and I stopped at a\nlight and suddenly for no reason that I\ncould come up with, I was weeping and I\nfelt a massive and awesome sense of the\npresence of God in the car with me. It\njust came and I had absolutely no control\nover it. I pulled over to the side of the\nroad—I remember thinking that I was so\nin love with Jesus at that moment that no\none else on the planet could come close.\nAfter about twenty minutes of real\nintensity the feeling subsided somewhat,\nbut the presence of Jesus stayed with me.\nI drove home not really ever able to fully\nexpress what happened without sounding\nlike ’'d taken something illegal.\n\nThe more immediate aim seemed to be\nto experience what Galatians 5:22-23\ncalls the “fruits of the spirit”: love, joy,\npeace, patience and so forth. The social\nlife of the church was rich in emotional\npractices which sought to reshape the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021361",
