Posting on Steptoe’s YouTube\nchannel (option B) with secured settings would make the link only accessible to those who receive the link. It\nwould also provide reporters with a faster way to view the video since they would not have to download\n\nit. Does that make sense?\n\nFrom: Will Bohlen [mailto\n\nSent: Friday, August 05, 2016 12:36 PM\n\nTo: King, Kathryn; Miller, Michael; Katelyn Wohlford; Y.

We don’t want it\ntoo accessible to people who might slice it up, and a youtube link would travel faster, | believe. We eventually want to\ntrim the video into chunks and post on YouTube through AFSV’s channels.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031478",
