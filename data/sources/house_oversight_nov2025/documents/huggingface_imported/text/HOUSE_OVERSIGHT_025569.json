  "text": "Morgan Stanley | RESEARCH\n\nUpside Scenario\n\nStarting with the framework laid out above, we make several key\nadjustments in our upside scenario to illustrate where we think mul-\ntiples go and where the stocks can trade over the near term if the alts\nconvert. Our upside scenario implies an average share price increase\n\nof 13% across the group.\n\ne First we fully tax effect the performance fee earnings.\nUnder a C-corp structure these would not get the pass-\nthrough benefit and would be subject to full taxes. We use a\nfull 24% tax drag on the net accrued carry receivable balance\nand the future net carry per share.\n\ne@ Second we adjust the FRE multiples upward. As we dis-\ncussed previously with our three approaches for FREmulti-\nples, we believe there is significant upside to the value of\nthese earnings if alts were to convert. This drives nearly all of\nthe upside from current prices in our upside scenario. We use\na 22.5x multiple on FRE in our upside case, which represents\n\n50% increase from the 15x multiple that we believe is priced\n\nin today.\nExhibit 28:\nUpside Scenario SOTP Valuation\n= B+C+D\nA B c D E\nwore ie After-Tax SOTP\nTicker Current 2018E FRE Snare BDC BS NAV Value Ex-\nPrice CoreFRE Multiple @ Value Per Per Share Carry Per\n24% tax\nShare Share\nRate\nAPO $36.42 669 22.5x $28.40 $0.00 $2.72 $31.13\nARES $24.70 185 22.5x $14.71 $4.52 $0.69 $19.92\nBX $36.78 1,196 22.5x $17.03 $0.00 $2.83 $19.86\nCG $25.60 100 22.5x $5.01 $0.00 $0.85 $5.86\nKKR $24.40 475 =. 22..5x $9.57 $0.00 $9.71 $19.28\nOAK $45.20 166 22.5x $18.17 $0.00 $15.19 $33.36\n\nSource: Company data, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\n\nNORTH AMERICA INSIGHT ~~\n\ne Last we assume 2x of multiple expansion for performance\n\nfees. As a starting point, we look at the implied multiples\nusing current share prices and a 15x multiple for FRE as\ndescribed above. We then add 2x turns of multiple expansion\nto each of the companies@urrent implied multiples. We look\nto the Goldman Sachs example earlier in the note as a comp\nfor cyclical financials earnings. Our group median for implied\nfuture carry multiples of 8.5x is just under one standard devi-\nation away from GS@historical P/E average of 9.5x. Although\nwe use the higher multiple, this is on a lower value of fully\ntaxed future performance fee earnings. The impact to valua-\ntion of future performance fees are mixed from company and\ncan be seen in greater detail in the following appendix with\ncompany specific SOTP and scenario analysis. While we\nexpect some multiple expansion for performance fees ina\nC-corp, the structure will not change the inherent vola-\ntility of the performance fee portion of earnings that is\n\nmarked to market.\n\n=GxH =E+F+I\n\nF G H I J\nAfter-Tax %\nNet Carry Net Carry Per Future Value of Total Increase\n‘ Share After 24%\nReceivable Carry Future jJValuePer from\nTax (Avg. 2018e- .\nPer Share 2020e) Multiple Carry Share Current\n@24% Rate Price\n$1.64 $1.86 7.1x $13.30 $46.07 26%\n$0.78 $0.48 13.6x $6.47 $27.18 10%\n$2.29 $1.57 11.5x $18.04 $40.18 9%\n$4.40 $2.17 8.0x $17.26 $27.52 8%\nPAesZ $0.71 9.0x $6.42 $27.01 11%\n$4.38 $1.68 7.5x $12.58 $50.31 11%\nAverage 9.5x 13%\nMedian 8.5x 10%\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025569",
