It is a flat protein laid down as a spiral on the\noutside of nerve cells. The theory is that cell firing causes myelination,\nwhich permanently imprints the memory.\n\nThe alternate class of theory proposes memory is encoded at a much\nsmaller scale. Neurons are quite complex structures in their own right.\nInside each neuron is a lattice of proteins, which forms a skeleton. Part\nof that skeleton provides structural integrity to the neuron, while other\nelements provide control and motility. It is this control part of the skeleton\nthat people believe might encodememory. A 2012 paper by Travis Craddock\nand Jack Tuszynski of the University of Alberta, and anesthesiologist Stuart\nHameroff of the University of Arizona proposes a protein called CaMKII\nbinds to the cytoskeleton in 32 different configurations, providing a binary\ndata encoding. It is an elegant idea but it also relies on your believing their\nmodel for quantum neuron processing which is still highly controversial.\nIf proven, they are my top Nobel Prize tip for this decade!\n\nPhotographic Memory\n\nUntil recently conventional wisdom held that true photographic memory\nwas a myth and the few people claiming to have it really used some sort\nof mnemonic memory technique to selectively memorize things.
