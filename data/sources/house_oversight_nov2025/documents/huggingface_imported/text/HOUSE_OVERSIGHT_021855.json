It was my understanding that the term\n\"massage\" was frequently, if not almost invariably, used\nas a code word for sexual abuse, or at least sexual\nactivity, if the girl happened to be over the age of 18.\nBut in most cases at least, or in many cases depending\non exactly what universe you're looking at, these were\nunderage girls, under the age of consent in the State of\nFlorida, they were under the age of 18.\n\nSometimes as young as -- I think it went all\nthe way down to, gosh, I'm trying to remember now, I\nthink 13 or 14 was was the youngest age in the police\nreport.\n\nQ. Is it your position that as of December 30th,\n2014, you had a sufficient basis under the Federal Rules\nof Procedure and applicable ethical rules to allege that\nanyone who got a massage at Mr. Epstein's residence had\nabused minors?\n\nA. No.\n\nQ. What -- back up now. With respect again to\nother minors as of December 30th, 2014, had anyone --\nhad any young woman, other than -- we will put -- I'm\n\ngoing to ask about Virginia Roberts separately.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021855",
