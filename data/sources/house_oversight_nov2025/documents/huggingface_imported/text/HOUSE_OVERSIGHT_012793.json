  "text": "large numbers of genetically unrelated strangers, and punish those who cheat by free-riding on others’\ngood will.\n\nThe challenge to any cooperative enterprise is to avoid getting suckered by free-riders who cheat\nand add little or no help. As group size grows, the opportunity to cheat and get away with it grows as\nwell given the challenges of storing information about reputation. How do individuals and groups avoid\nthis sucker problem?\n\nWhen nonhuman animals cooperate with members of the same species, they typically target kin.\nHelping kin provides a buffer against the sucker’s costs because investing in kin means investing in\ngenetic posterity. Helping relatives, even at a cost, translates to helping ones genes move on into the next\ngeneration — an insight developed by the British evolutionary biologist William D. Hamilton. When\ncooperation involves unrelated others, nonhuman animals attempt to circumvent the sucker’s problem by\nworking with a small number of familiar others whose reputation is known, targeting contexts where all\nparticipants benefit more from working cooperatively than working alone. These mutual benefits help\noffset the costs of cooperation.\n\nBy restricting cooperation to relatives or small numbers of unrelated but familiar group members,\nanimal societies have buffered themselves from extreme cheating. This is significant because cheaters\narise in a variety of contexts where there are rules of engagement, including both cooperative and non-\ncooperative situations. For example, both lions and chimpanzees cooperate in group defense against\ndangerous neighbors. Some individuals cheat by lagging behind, or failing to join in altogether. In\nsocieties organized around hierarchies, low ranking animals sometimes cheat by attempting to eat more\nthan their fare share or by reproducing when their societal norms explicitly forbid it. Interestingly,\ncheaters in cooperative situations such as those in lions and chimpanzees, never suffer any adverse\nconsequences from the dominants. In contrast, cheaters in competitive situations such as those that arise\nin hierarchical societies, are punished. Nonhuman animals thus have the capacity to recognize and\nchange rule breakers. And yet, these capacities are not applied in the context of cooperative interactions.\nMonogamous thinking rules.\n\nWhen it comes to enforcing fairness in cooperation, the fundamental barrier for animals lies with\nthe economics of punishment. Punishment is costly. When a cheater is detected and attacked, there is\nalways the possibility that he will retaliate. Cheaters, even when caught, need not surrender without a\nfight. Punishment therefore requires the capacity to surmount an immediate cost, while recognizing the\npossibility that any benefit could be greatly delayed. For example, lashing out against a lion laggard or a\nchimpanzee cheater might cause each to join in on future cooperative ventures, but this is a delayed\nbenefit, and it may never materialize. This adds another potential opportunity cost. As Shakespeare so\n\ndeftly noted “Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends.”\n\nHauser Chapter 1. Nature’s secrets 47\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012793",
