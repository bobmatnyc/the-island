He has also made blanket assertions of a variety of\nprivileges, but has produced no privilege logs.\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nAccordingly, Edwards and Cassell request:\n\n1. That Dershowitz be directed to produce all materials covered by the discovery\nrequests forthwith;\n\n2. That Dershowitz be held to have waived any and all otherwise applicable privileges as\na consequence of his failure to timely file a privilege log; and\n\n3. That Dershowitz be ordered to pay reasonable costs and attorneys’ fees associated\nwith the need to file this motion to compel.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO RESOLVE\n\nPlaintiffs have attempted in good faith to resolve the discovery issues presented in this\n\nmotion (and others) as evidenced by the letter attached as Exhibit B. The Defendant has failed to\n\nrespond as of the time of the filing of this motion.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014096",
