  "text": "32\n\nmore in line with what you’re trying to achieve over time,’” she\nrecalls. “And I said, ‘I don’t know how you do one without the\nother.””\n\nHillary has already had some successes, most conspicuously her use\nof American diplomatic leverage in the U.N. Security Council to get\nChina and especially Russia to help isolate Iran and North Korea. She\nand the president have convinced the Russians that proffering\nmilitary hardware to [ran isn’t in their national-security interest—a\ntough sell. And ever since Obama bollixed up his relations with\nIsraeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in 2010, Hillary has\nworked overtime to soothe Bibi. “She’s indispensable—the only one\ntrusted on all sides [of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict],” says Sandy\nBerger, who served as Bill Clinton’s National Security Council\nadviser.\n\nMost conspicuously, Hillary has championed what has come to be\nknown as “civil society.” In practice that means moving beyond the\nusual contacts between the United States and foreign governments to\nforge ties with the non-governmental organizations (NGOs) that are\nessential to stability and development. Like her husband, she’s\ndeployed her international stature for “convening power,” bringing\ntogether governments and NGOs on a dizzying array of significant\nprojects that would otherwise lack support.\n\nAlways a generalist, Hillary thinks concentrating too much on one\narea is hazardous. “We’ve got a big world out there, and [if] you\nignore some part of it, it comes back to bite you,” she tells me. So she\nhas tried to strike a balance between hot spots and the more mundane\nmanagement decisions that she thinks are necessary to elevate\ndiplomacy and development to the level of defense. That way, the\nUnited States would have a more sophisticated, “3-D” foreign policy,\nlooking short-term and long-term, top-down and people-up. Hillary\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024989",
