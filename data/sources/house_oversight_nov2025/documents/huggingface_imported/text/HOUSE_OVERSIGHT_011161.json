This procedure equates the MRS in fitness (the left-hand\nside of the equation) with that in exchange (the right-hand side), and is justified as follows. The\nargument in figure 3 shows that, in evolutionary equilibrium, the MRS in fitness must equal that\nin preferences. Furthermore, in market equilibrium the MRS in preferences must equal that in\nexchange. In studying equation 9, we are examining the implications of the hypothesis that both\nequilibrium assumptions hold true.\n\nAs in my previous paper on time preference, I concentrate on intergenerational investments in\nwhich the investment benefits the investor’s daughter after exactly one generation. By assumption,\nthe mother and daughter are affected at the same age, so that the two reproductive values in MRS;\nare equal. In stationary equilibrium, the mother and daughter will also have equal wealth at this\ncommon age, so that the marginal effects of consumption on their fertility and survival are equal as\nwell. Consequently, the right-most fraction in equation 8 equals unity, and MRS = e’ /r, where\nr = 1/2 (since the two individuals are mother and daughter), and 7 equals the generation length,\nT..

Since evolutionary changes are usually slow, the last couple of centuries\nof rapid growth have probably had no large effect. Prior to that, o must on average have been near\nzero. Thus, equation 10 suggests that 1 ~ (In2)/T. The generation time T’ is usually a little less\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011161",
