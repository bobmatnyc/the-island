The \nwellbeing of your children and grandchildren depend upon it! \nMike \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026620 \n- \nThe Iran Nuclear Deal \nDear Friend, \nThis week, our featured video is as urgent as it gets. Just days after President Obama and \nSecretary of State John Kerry announced the nuclear deal with Iran, Dennis Prager was in \nstudio recording a video explaining why the deal is so dangerous, and how it parallels what \nhappened in 1938 between Great Britain and Nazi Germany. This is the fastest turn-\naround time on any video we've released in PragerU's history, but what's at stake is so \nmonumentally important, we knew we couldn't waste any time. So please take five minutes \nto watch the video. Forward it to your family, friends, and the offices of your Congressional \nrepresentatives. We all have an obligation to do whatever is in our power to impact as \nmany people on this topic as we can. \nClick image above or here to watch this video \n- \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026621 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026622",
