( over 18). I was never, ever, his \" sex slave \" \n. obviously a lurid chauvenistic categorization, which in my opinion could only have been \nmade by some loser of a repressed male reporter. He was always kind , funny and generous to \nme. These fantasy fabrications made by a delusional thief. ( charged with stealing from the burger \nplace and which she worked, though she claimed to paid thousands of dollars in cash and held at \nthe beck and call of the genious tycoon. ) . Her story telling had it been done while sleeping would \nhave been called dreaming, if awake, hallucinaitons but to the English press they are referred to as \nallegations . She claimed in the minutest of detail , her dinner with President Clinton on the \nCaribean Island, How he arrived. ( by black heli). where he sat. ,(on jeffreys left.) a 21st century \ntale of power, sex, money. The fact is that this story is total make believe , fabricated on purpose \nto gain tabloid attention ,and easily refuted by readily availalble travel records of a former \npresident. . it defies belief that any person would take seriously such a preposterous story. little \ndifferent than her telling her father that she met the queen, whoops- he believed her though her \nmother at the relevant time complained that she must have been engaging in satan worship and \nasked that she be put her in a drug home. cmon. I am currenty a professional pilot with a spotless \nrecord.
