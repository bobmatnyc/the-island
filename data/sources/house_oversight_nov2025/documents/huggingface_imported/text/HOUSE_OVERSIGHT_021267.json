  "text": "transition of the egg from beneath the\nwarmth and safety of the mother to atop\nthe feet and under a fold of feathered\nabdominal skin of the father requires a\nbit of coordination on the part of the\ntwo. Even this is not sufficient for the\ngenes of this pair to find their way into\nthe gene pool. The conditions of the\nAntarctic winters are among the least\nhospitable on earth, with winter\ntemperatures dipping below -60 degrees\nCelsius and winds reaching 120 mph.\nTo protect themselves from the wind and\ncold, the male penguins huddle together,\nspending much of their time sleeping to\nconserve energy. In this harsh\nenvironment, survival of the chicks\ndepends on the shared warmth and\nprotection of the huddle, not the\nindividual. The group as a whole is\nmore likely to survive if each penguin\nand chick shares in the warmth and\nprotection of the collective structure,\nwhich means selective pressures exist to\npromote cooperation to maintain the\nintegrity of the huddle. More generally,\nfor species born to a period of utter\ndependency, the genes that find their\nway into the gene pool are not defined\nsolely or even mostly by likelihood that\nan organism will reproduce but by the\nlikelihood that the offspring of the parent\nwill live long enough to reproduce. As\nin the case of the Emperor penguins, one\nconsequence is that selfish genes\nevolved through individual-level\nselection processes to promote social\npreferences and group processes,\nincluding reciprocal social behaviors,\nthat can extend beyond kin relationships\n(e.g., 5). Examples of such selection\nprocesses in humans exist, as well (e.g.,\n6, 7).\n\nThe environmental challenges\nfacing Emperor penguins, as daunting as\nthey are, pale by comparison to the\n\nPage |21\n\ncomplexities facing the human species.\nIndeed, the social brain hypothesis posits\nthat the social complexities and demands\nof primate species contributed to the\nrapid increase in neocortical (1.e., the\nouter layer of the brain) connectivity and\nintelligence (8). Warfare among\nancestral hunter-gatherers appears to\nhave contributed to group selection for\nhuman social behaviors, especially\naltruistic behaviors (5). As Darwin\n(1871) noted:\n\nA tribe including many members\nwho, from possessing a high\ndegree of the spirit of patriotism,\nfidelity, obedience, courage, and\nsympathy, were always ready to\naid one another, and to sacrifice\nthemselves for the common good\nwould be victorious over most\nother tribes; and this would be\nnatural selection. (p. 166)\n\nMoreover, deducing better ways\nto find food, avoid perils, and navigate\nterritories has adaptive value for large\nmammals, but the complexities of these\necological demands are no match for the\ncomplexities of social living (especially\nin hostile between-group social\nenvironments), which include:\nrecognizing ingroup and outgroup\nmembers; learning by social observation;\nrecognizing the shifting status of friends\nand foes; anticipating and coordinating\nefforts between two or more individuals;\nusing language to communicate, reason,\nteach, and deceive others; orchestrating\nrelationships, ranging from pair bonds\nand families to friends, bands, and\ncoalitions; navigating complex social\nhierarchies, social norms and cultural\ndevelopments; subjugating self-interests\nto the interests of the pair bond or social\ngroup in exchange for the possibility of\nlong term benefits for oneself or one’s\ngroup; recruiting support to sanction\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021267",
