  "text": "Later this century giant robotic fabricators may assemble vast lightweight structures\nin space (gossamer-thin radio reflectors or solar energy collectors , for instance) —\nusing raw materials mined from the Moon or asteroids.\n\nRobotic and AI advances are eroding the practical case for human spaceflight.\n\nNonetheless, I hope people will follow the robots, though it will be as risk-seeking\nadventurers rather than for practical goals. The most promising developments are\nspearheaded by private companies. Elon Musk’s Space X, has launched unmanned\npayloads and docked with the Space Station — and has successfully recovered and\nreuseed the launch-rocket’s first stage — presaging real cost-saving. He hopes soon to\noffer orbital flights to paying customers.\n\nWealthy adventurers are already signing up for a week-long trip round the far side of\nthe Moon - voyaging further from Earth than anyone has been before I’m told they’ve\nsold a ticket for the second flight but not for the first flight.\n\nWe should surely acclaim these private enterprise efforts in space — they can tolerate\nhigher risks than a western government could impose on publicly-funded civilian\nastronauts, and thereby cut costs compared to NASA or ESA. But they should be\npromoted as adventures or extreme sports -- the phrase ‘space tourism’ should be\navoided. It lulls people into unrealistic confidence.\n\nBy 2100 courageous pioneers in the mould of (say) Felix Baumgartner, who broke the\nsound barrier in free fall from a high-altitude balloon -- may have established ‘bases’\nindependent from the Earth — on Mars, or maybe on asteroids. Musk himself (aged 45)\nsays he wants to die on Mars — but not on impact.\n\nBut don’t ever expect mass emigration from Earth. Nowhere in our Solar system\noffers an environment even as clement as the Antarctic or the top of Everest. It’s a\ndangerous delusion to think that space offers an escape from Earth's problems.\nThere’s no ‘Planet B’.\n\nIndeed, space is an inherently hostile environment for humans. For that reason, even\nthough we may wish to regulate genetic and cyborg technology on Earth, we should\nsurely wish the space pioneers good luck in using all such techniques to adapt to alien\nconditions. They'll free from terrestrial regulation and have maximal incentive to do\nso. Indeed, these spacefarers may spearhead the post-human era — evolving within a\nfew centuries into a new species\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026738",
