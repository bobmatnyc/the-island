  "text": "54022\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nII, subsection B, “Statutory Authority,”\nabove.)\n\nThe contention that the right to\nrefrain from engaging in union activity\nis ‘‘buried”’ in the list of other\naffirmative rights or that the Board is\nbiased in favor of unionization because\nof the choice of placement is without\nmerit. The list of rights in the proposed\nnotice is patterned after the list of rights\nin Section 7 of the NLRA, 29 U.S.C. 157.\nSection 7 lists the right to refrain last,\nafter stating several other affirmative\nrights before it. In addition, the Board’s\nremedial notices list the right to refrain\nlast. See Ishikawa Gasket America, Inc.,\nabove. So does the Board’s Notice of\nElection. In addition, the notice\nrequired by this rule states that it is\nillegal for an employer to take adverse\naction against an employee ‘‘because\n[the employee] choose[s] not to engage\nin any such [union-related] activity.”\nThe Board has revised the introduction\nof the notice to include the right to\nrefrain—this addition further highlights\nan employee’s right to refrain from\nunion activity. Finally, the Board\nbelieves that people understand a right\nas different from an obligation and thus\nwill, for example, understand that the\nright to organize a union includes the\nright not to do so. Accordingly, the\nBoard concludes that the notice\nsufficiently addresses the right to refrain\namong the list of statutory rights. In\naddressing the numerous comments\nquestioning the Board’s neutrality, the\nBoard points out that in Section 1 of the\nNLRA, Congress declared that it is the\npolicy of the United States to mitigate\nor eliminate obstructions to the free\nflow of commerce “‘by encouraging the\npractice and procedure of collective\nbargaining and by protecting the\nexercise by workers of full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their\nown choosing, for the purpose of\nnegotiating the terms and conditions of\ntheir employment or other mutual aid or\nprotection.” 29 U.S.C. 151. Thus, by its\nown terms, the NLRA encourages\ncollective bargaining and the exercise of\nthe other affirmative rights guaranteed\nby the statute. In doing so, however, the\nNLRA seeks to ensure employee choice\nboth to participate in union or other\nprotected concerted activity and to\nrefrain from doing so.\n\nTurning to the issues of whether the\nnotice creates the impression that the\nemployer is encouraging unionization\nand whether an employer can be\ncompelled to post the notice which\ncontains information the employer\nwould otherwise not share with\nemployees, the Board disagrees with\nboth arguments. First, the notice clearly\n\nstates that it is from the government.\nSecond, in light of the other workplace\nnotice employees are accustomed to\nseeing, employees will understand that\nthe notice is a communication to\nworkers from the government, not from\nthe employer. Finally, as discussed\nabove, NLRA Section 8(c) protects\nemployers’ right to express any ‘‘views,\nargument, or opinion” “if such\nexpression contains no threat of reprisal\nor force or promise of benefit.’’ The rule\ndoes not affect this right. Therefore, if\nan employer is concerned that\nemployees will get the wrong\nimpression, it may legally express its\nopinion regarding unionization as long\nas it does so in a noncoercive manner.\nCritics of the notice contend that the\nnotice should contain a number of\nadditional rights and also explanations\nof when and how an employee may opt\nout of paying union dues. Thus, most\nemployer groups argue that the notice\nshould contain a statement regarding\nthe right to decertify a union. A number\nof those comments state that the notice\nshould provide detailed guidance on the\nprocess for decertifying a union. Others\nsuggest that the notice should contain\ninstructions for deauthorizing a union\nsecurity clause. A majority of employers\nand individuals who filed comments on\nthe content of the notice urge the Board\nto include a notice of employee rights\nunder Communications Workers v.\nBeck. Baker & McKenzie suggests\nadding a provision informing employees\nthat for religious purposes an employee\nmay opt out of paying dues to a\nunion.1°7 A few comments also suggest\nthat the notice add any rights that\nemployees may have in “right-to-work”’\nstates. As indicated previously,\nnumerous comments suggest the\ninclusion of other rights of employees\nwho do not desire union representation.\nBaker & McKenzie suggests a list of 26\nadditional affirmative rights, most of\nwhich only affect employees in a\nunionized setting and are derived from\nthe Labor-Management Reporting and\nDisclosure Act, the Labor-Management\nRelations Act, or other Federal labor\nstatutes enforced by the Department of\nLabor. The proposed list also includes\n\n107 NLRA Section 19 provides that “Any\nemployee who is a member of and adheres to\nestablished and traditional tenets or teachings of a\nbona fide religion, body, or sect which has\nhistorically held conscientious objections to joining\nor financially supporting labor organizations shall\nnot be required to join or financially support any\nlabor organization as a condition of employment;\nexcept that such employee may be required ina\ncontract between such employee’s employer and a\nlabor organization in lieu of periodic dues and\ninitiation fees, to pay sums equal to such dues and\ninitiation fees to a nonreligious, nonlabor\norganization charitable fund exempt from\ntaxation[.]’’ 29 U.S.C. 169.\n\nsome rights covered by the NLRA such\nas “the right to sign or refuse to sign an\nauthorization card,” ‘‘the right to\ndiscuss the advantages and\ndisadvantages of union representation\nor membership with the employer,’ and\n“the right to receive information from\nthe employer regarding the advantages\nand disadvantages of union\nrepresentation.”’\n\nThe Board has determined that the\ninclusion of these additional items is\nunnecessary. As discussed above, the\nNLRA itself contains only a general\nstatement that employees have the right\nnot to participate in union and/or other\nprotected concerted activities. Section\n19 does specifically set forth the right of\ncertain religious objectors to pay the\nequivalent of union dues to a tax-\nexempt charity; however, this right is\nimplicated only when an employer and\nunion have entered into a union-\nsecurity arrangement. Because the\nnotice does not mention or explain such\narrangements, the Board finds no reason\nto list this narrow exception to union-\nsecurity requirements. In sum, the\nBoard is not persuaded that the notice\nneeds to expand further on the right to\nrefrain by including a list of specific\nways in which employees can elect not\nto participate or opt out of paying union\ndues. Employees who desire more\ninformation regarding the right not to\nparticipate can contact the Board.\n\nThe Board does not believe that\nfurther explication of this point is\nnecessary. However, because so many\ncomments argue that the notice should\ninclude the right to decertify a union\nand rights under Communication\nWorkers v. Beck, the Board has decided\nto explain specifically why it disagrees\nwith each contention.\n\nConcerning the right to decertify, the\nnotice states that employees have the\nright not to engage in union activity,\n“including joining or remaining a\nmember of a union.” Moreover, the\nnotice does not mention the right to\nseek Board certification of a union.\nIndeed, contrary to the numerous\ncomments suggesting that the proposed\nnotice is a “roadmap” for union\norganizing, the notice does not even\nmention the right to petition for a union\nrepresentation election, possibly leading\nto union certification; rather, it merely\nstates that employees have the right to\n“organize a union” and “form, join or\nassist a union.”’ The notice does not give\nany further instructions on how an\nemployee can exercise those rights.\nSimilarly, the notice states that\nemployees may choose not to remain a\nmember of a union without further\ninstructions on how to exercise that\nright.
