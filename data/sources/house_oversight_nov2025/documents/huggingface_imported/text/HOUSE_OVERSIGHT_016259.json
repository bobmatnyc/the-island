  "text": "Imagine it is 1958 and you are trying to defend the continental United States against\nairborne attack. To distinguish hostile aircraft, one of the things you need, besides a\nnetwork of computers and early-warning radar sites, is a map of all commercial air\ntraffic, updated in real time. The United States built such a system and named it SAGE\n(Semi-Automatic Ground Environment). SAGE in turn spawned Sabre, the first\nintegrated reservation system for booking airline travel in real time. Sabre and its\nprogeny soon became not just a map as to what seats were available but also a system\nthat began to control, with decentralized intelligence, where airliners would fly, and\nwhen.\n\nBut isn’t there a control room somewhere, with someone at the controls? Maybe\nnot. Say, for example, you build a system to map highway traffic in real time, simply by\ngiving cars access to the map in exchange for reporting their own speed and location at\nthe time. The result is a fully decentralized control system. Nowhere is there any\ncontrolling model of the system except the system itself.\n\nImagine it is the first decade of the 21st century and you want to track the\ncomplexity of human relationships in real time. For social life at a small college, you\ncould construct a central database and keep it up to date, but its upkeep would become\noverwhelming if taken to any larger scale. Better to pass out free copies of a simple\nsemi-autonomous code, hosted locally, and let the social network update itself. This code\nis executed by digital computers, but the analog computing performed by the system as a\nwhole far exceeds the complexity of the underlying code. The resulting pulse-frequency\ncoded model of the social graph becomes the social graph. It spreads wildly across the\ncampus and then the world.\n\nWhat if you wanted to build a machine to capture what everything known to the\nhuman species means? With Moore’s Law behind you, it doesn’t take too long to digitize\nall the information in the world. You scan every book ever printed, collect every email\never written, and gather forty-nine years of video every twenty-four hours, while tracking\nwhere people are and what they do, in real time. But how do you capture the meaning?\n\nEven in the age of all things digital, this cannot be defined in any strictly logical\nsense, because meaning, among humans, isn’t fundamentally logical. The best you can\ndo, once you have collected all possible answers, is to invite well-defined questions and\ncompile a pulse-frequency weighted map of how everything connects. Before you know\nit, your system will not only be observing and mapping the meaning of things, it will start\nconstructing meaning as well. In time, it will control meaning, in the same way as the\ntraffic map starts to control the flow of traffic even though no one seems to be in control.\n\nThere are three laws of artificial intelligence. The first, known as Ashby’s Law, after\ncybernetician W. Ross Ashby, author of Design for a Brain, states that any effective\ncontrol system must be as complex as the system it controls.\n\nThe second law, articulated by John von Neumann, states that the defining\ncharacteristic of a complex system is that it constitutes its own simplest behavioral\ndescription. The simplest complete model of an organism is the organism itself. Trying\nto reduce the system’s behavior to any formal description makes things more\ncomplicated, not less.\n\n39\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016259",
