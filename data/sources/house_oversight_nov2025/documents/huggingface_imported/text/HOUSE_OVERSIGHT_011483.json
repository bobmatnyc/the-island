  "text": "need remains what I tried to impress on my negotiators then: realism. A\nmeticulously informed, utterly unvarnished, understanding of the threats we\nface, of each altered situation after every success or a failure, and an ability to\nset aside the background noise and political pressures and chart a way forward.\n\nSo what is that way? It begins with the mindset. On more than one occasion\nin the past few years, after Prime Minister Netanyahu had warned our country\nof a nuclear Iran or the spread of Al Qaeda-style hatred and violence, as if\nprophesying the coming of Armageddon, I would say to him: “Stop talking like\nthat. You’re not delivering a sermon in a synagogue. You’re Prime Minister.”\nHaving been privileged to live my own life along with the entire modern history\nof our country, I went further. Zionism, the founding architecture of Israel, was\nrooted in finding a way to supplant not just the life, but the way of thinking,\nwhich hard-pressed Jewish communities had internalised over centuries in the\ndiaspora: in Hebrew, the galut. We would instead take control of our own\ndestiny, building and developing and securing our own country.\n\nNow, I told Bibi, he was back in the mindset of the galut. Yes, al-Qaeda, and\nmore recently Islamic State, were real dangers. The prospect of a nuclear Iran\nwas even more so. “But the implication of the way you speak, not just to Barack\nObama or David Cameron, but to /sraelis, is that these are existential threats.\nWhat do you imagine? That if, God forbid, we wake up and Iran is a nuclear\npower, we’ll pack up and go back to the shtetls of Europe?”\n\nOf course not. Israel, as my public life has taught me more than most,\nremains strong militarily. We are, still, fully capable of turning back any of the\nundeniable threats on our doorstep. Keeping that strength, developing it and\nmodernizng it, are obviously critically important. But as Israel’s founding Prime\nMinister, David Ben-Gurion, used to say, the success of Zionism, and of the\nIsraeli state, required two things: strength and “righteousness.” He didn’t mean\nthe word in purely religious terms. He meant that Israel, if it were to retain\ninternational backing and internal cohesion, must be guided by a core of moral\nassumptions as well.\n\nThat, in itself, would be reason enough to pursue every possible opportunity\nfor “end of conflict” with our neighbours. And, at home, to protect and re-\ninforce our commitment to Israel as both a Jewish and a democratic state. But\nIsrael’s simple self-interest — its hope for prosperity, social cohesion, and\ngrowth in future — makes this nothing short of imperative.\n\n12\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011483",
