  "text": "6. | had taped an interview on an electric recorder-transcriber, plus a\nbattery-operated cassette recorder as a back-up precaution, which turned\nout to be an absolute necessity when the electric recorder conked out\nright in the middle.\n\nLater on, | bought a new one to replace it, but first | had to get rid of\nthe old one. My desk consisted of a wooden door supported by a couple\nof two-drawer filing cabinets. | was just too damn lazy to take all the\nequipment and books off the desk so that | could move the desk toward\nme and pull up the wire from behind it.\n\nSo | simply cut the wire with a pair of scissors. Bzzzzzt///| was shocked, but\nnot injured. Though the recorder had conked out, | had incredibly left the wire\nstill plugged into a socket on the surge protector. Where the scissors had cut the\nwire, parts of the metal had melted away just a couple of inches from my hand. |\nmight’ ve been electrocuted. Yikes/\n\n| could’ ve been killed, and the cause would’ ve been a simple lack\nof the practice of mindfulness that | treasure so much. Instead, | had\nemptied my mind. Oops, wrong discipline. But | was still alive, and |\nthanked God for that. And then | heard a resplendent voice booming\n\nthrough the clouds: “SHUT UP, YOU SUPERSTITIOUS FOOL!“\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015456",
