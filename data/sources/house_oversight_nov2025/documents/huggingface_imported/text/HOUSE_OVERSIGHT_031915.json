  "text": "3\n\nAmerica. We have a group in this country that likes to will outcomes,\nand their track record demonstrates that that doesn’t work so well\n(unless you think, apropos Iraq, that eight years and more than\n100,000 lives later defines “well’). Obama has been more in the mold\nof George H.W. Bush and his secretary of state, Jim Baker, when the\nEastern bloc was throwing off Moscow’s shackles. Offer\nencouragement and stability, give a few speeches about freedom, but\notherwise let them do their own work. Obama took a lot of stick for\nnot being more forceful on Egypt in February, but he was right to be\ncautious—there were lots of stakeholders involved, and sorry, but the\npresident of the United States just can’t say every sweet thing\nromantics would like him to say. He then, as noted, took heat for\nmoving too slowly on Libya, but here again he was correct. The\nnature of the Libyan regime is not a direct national-security issue, so\nthere absolutely had to be a specific trigger to justify acting. That\ntrigger was Gaddafi’s threatened assault on Benghazi. That was\ncompletely the right thing to do. It was as textbook a fulfillment of\n“R2P,” or “responsibility to protect,” as one could imagine. The\nsubsequent bombing campaign took longer than advertised, but it has\napparently done the job, quickly and with far smaller loss of life\n(including zero U.S. deaths) than if we’d followed John McCain and\nLindsey Graham’s advice and gone in with ground troops. One of the\nbest things an American administration can do when big changes are\nafoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the way and not act as if\nwe can will an outcome just because we’re America. Next comes\nSyria. Conservatives are pushing Obama to take stronger steps.\nMaybe he should. I argued back in the spring, before Obama imposed\nsanctions on Assad, that he needed to be more forceful. But now he\nhas imposed those sanctions and said Assad should step down. Doing\nmuch more seems dubious. Bashar al-Assad will go. It’s a matter of\nwhen. Better to let it play out. If a true R2P situation arises, then\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031915",
