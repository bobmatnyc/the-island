Columbia University’s Nobelist in the brain\nsciences, Eric Kandel studied the neural mechanisms of habituation as a primitive,\naccessible and fundamental example of learning, the association of a nonresponse\nto a usually evocative stimulus, in Aplysia californica. The sea snails learned not to\nrespond to a local irritation with a gill-withdrawal response when exposed to it many\ntimes. They learned to stop paying attention to the perturbation. The background\nnoise appears to disappear after a little time in the Mall. Though his exploration of\nits synaptic mechanisms involved the neural circuit of the gill-withdrawal reflex in the\nmarine snail, its generality and human relevance is well established. Hundreds of\npapers can be found reporting the results of studies of habituation in normal\nhumans under all kinds of circumstances as well as in psychopathological\nconditions. That it samples something both fundamental and persistent is suggested\nby studies in children by one of Kandel’s students, Michael Lewis. He found that the\nrate of habituation of a startle response to a bright light in one-year-old human\ninfants predicted success in many kinds of learning and other cognitive functions\nwhen the children were tested again at the age of four. Pavlov’s experiments\nstudied habituation of the classically conditioned salivary response to meat powder-\ncoupled bell sounds in dogs in which the bell was followed by nothing, not only led\nto inhibition of the salivary response with unreinforced trial repetition but\ngeneralization of the inhibitory state such that dogs were observed to freeze in\nmotionless catatonic states for hours. In the language of our statistical measures,\nthe fixation of the dog’s behavior would manifest minimal entropy in the form of H7 =\nHu = 0 and the lowest complexity values for AC and srs. Entheogenic agents like\nLSD or mescaline inhibit the process of habituation and fixation, maximizing the\nentropy of behavioral measures, H7, Hy > 1 and high complexity values for AC and\nsrs.\n\nMark Geyer and David Braff, Professors at the University of California in La\nJolla and Michael Davis, a Professor at Yale’s School of Medicine, found that\nentheogenic agents, such as mescaline and LSD, as well as naturally occurring\nindoleamines, such as DMT, which occurs naturally in human brain, prevented\n\nhabituation of startle responding in mammals.
