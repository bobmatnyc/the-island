  "text": "method can often have uncanny predictive powers. But the problem is it\ndoesn’t scale very well—the market, having discerned a pattern of\nsuccessful investing, quickly copies and discounts the advantage. Epstein’s\neffort was to identify a dozen or so promising algorithms (each quant is\neffectively hawking his secret sauce algorithm) and invest up to $5 million\nwith each. I knew paltry little about this and so rather found myself\nidentifying with the young women to whom Epstein was explaining the\nbasic math and mechanics—out of my league, but grateful for the lesson.\n\nThe Epstein house/office is, by careful design, exclusive and club like,\npart hang out, part secret society. Along with the difficulty in explaining\nwhy, even after his jail term, the rich and powerful continued to beat a path\nto his door, it’s also notable in the fixed hierarchy of who comes to whose\nturf, that everybody, when they went to see Epstein, comes to him.\n\nA week in late September, U.N. week as it happened, began, on\nSunday, at Epstein’s house with a colloquial for billionaires—Gates, Mort\nZuckerman, and Peter Thiel [TK].\n\nEpstein, preternaturally responsive to both the price of oil and to the\npolitics of the middle of east, entertained that evening a delegation from\nQatar, including Sheikh Hamad Bin Jassim, the foreign minister. Hamad,\nindeed, lives across the street in a similarly furnished house—he and Epstein\nhave the same decorator. Epstein, in his relaxed and amused manner, kept\nprodding: “Why are you financing the bad guys? What do you get out of\nthat?”\n\nThe Qatarians, in some mild diplomatic discomfort, seemed most\nworried that their bid for the World Cup might be compromised by bribery\nallegations.\n\nAt 9:00 next morning, Epstein is joined for breakfast in the dining\nroom by Reid Weingarten, who’s represented among other fat cats in\ntrouble, Worldcom’s Bernie Ebbers and Goldman Sach’s Lloyd Blankfein\nand is one of attorney general Eric Holder’s closest friends. Weingarten,\nhorse, with a cold, and dejected, is just back from a failed defense of former\nConnecticut Governor John Rowland.\n\nAfter a blow by blow of the trial, there’s a discussion of the\nQartarian’s visit—Epstein is serving chocolate made from pistachios grown\non the Sheikh’s farm—and speculation about who actually controls ISIS.\n\n“Why?” I asked Weingarten, when Epstein briefly steps out of the\nroom, “do some many people keep coming back here, everything\nconsidered.”\n\n“Why we camp out here? I guess because there’s no place like it.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022751",
