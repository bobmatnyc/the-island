  "text": "grandfather was put in charge of holding the money until rebuilding plans were\nworked out. The problem was that word spread quickly about the rebuilding\nfund. On the night of September 16, 1912, two burglars burst into my\ngrandfather’s home and stole the money. They beat him and my grandmother to\ndeath with an axle wrenched loose from a nearby carriage. Their four-year-old\nson Meir — my father’s older brother — suffered a deep wound from where the\nattackers drove the metal shaft into his head. He carried a golf-ball-sized\nindentation in his forehead for the rest of his life. My father had burrowed into a\ncorner, and the attackers didn’t see him.\n\nThe two orphaned boys were raised by their paternal grandmother, Itzila. Yet\nany return to normalcy they may have experienced was cut short by the\noutbreak of the First World War, forcing her to flee with them by train ahead of\nthe advancing German army. They ended up some 1,500 miles south, in the\nCrimean city of Simferopol. Initially under czarist rule, then the Bolsheviks and\nfrom late 1917 until the end of the war under the Germans, they had to deal with\ncold, damp and a chronic shortage of food. My Uncle Meir quickly learned how\nto survive. He later told me that he would run after German supply carriages\nand collect the odd potato that fell off the back. Realizing that the German\nsoldiers had been wrenched from their own families by the war, he began taking\nmy father with him on weekends to the neighborhood near their barracks, where\nthe soldiers would sometimes give them cookies, or even a loaf of bread. Yet\nthey were deprived of the basic ingredients of a healthy childhood: nutritious\nfood and a warm, dry room in which to sleep. By the time Itzila brought them\nback to settle in Ponovezh at the end of the war, my father was diagnosed with\nthe bone-development disease, rickets, caused by the lack of Vitamin D in their\ndiet.\n\nIn another way, however, my father was the more fortunate of the boys. The\nlost schooling of those wartime years came at a less formative time for him than\nfor his brother. Meir never fully made up the lost ground in school. My father\nsimply began his Jewish primary education, cheder, a couple of years later than\nusual. He thrived there. Still, when it was time for him to enter secondary\neducation, he decided against going on with his religious education. Meir was\npreparing to leave for Palestine, so my father enrolled in the Hebrew-language,\nZionist high school. When he graduated, one of the many Brog relatives who\nwere by now living in the United States, his Uncle Jacob, tried to persuade him\nto come to Pittsburgh for university studies. But with Meir signing on as his\nsponsor with the British Mandate authorities, he left for Palestine shortly before\n\n21\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011492",
