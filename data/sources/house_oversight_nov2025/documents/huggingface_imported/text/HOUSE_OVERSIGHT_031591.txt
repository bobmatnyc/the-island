Dear Jeff,

Your name popped up again in the Press and I thought it was time to congratulate you on your wonderful
financial successes since your days as my Physics prof at Dalton!! The young, bright options trader, who
understood Black Sholes and how to use it, at Bear, made good!!

Unless your PR advisor is Donald Trump, I am not sure that current press provides you with much benefit.
Perhaps I am wrong? Not the first time!!

Anyway, middle age has brought its own unique set of challenges. Aging certainly ain’t for sissy’s.

Regards,

Ps. David Asch and I toasted to you during our Thanksgiving weekend in Amagansett in November.
