  "text": "We should note that our conviction in US preeminence and US economic growth in\n2017 is greater than our conviction in the direction of the equity markets. Just as we\nwere appropriately humble about how much further equity markets could fall when\nwe published our 2009 Outlook, we are equally humble today about our financial\nmarket outlook given the significant uncertainties ahead.\n\nHere, we are reminded of Voltaire’s famous words: “Doubt is not an agreeable\ncondition, but certainty is an absurd one.” A client with a well-diversified portfolio\nthat is fully invested at its US equity allocation is generally well positioned for these\nuncertain and probably volatile times.\n\nWe hope our 2017 Outlook is helpful as you evaluate your portfolio allocations.\nWe also wish you a healthy, happy and productive 2017.\n\nThe Investment Strategy Group\n\nOutlook | Investment Strategy Group 3\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014536",
