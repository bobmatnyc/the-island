That’: all it is. It's an\n\nindex of money laundering.”\n\n— BlackRock CEO Larry Fink, October 13, 2017\n\n= Because bitcoin is pseudonymous, not anonymous, users’ real-world identities are ascertainable once the individual\nconverts bitcoin to fiat currency.\n\n= Digital intelligence companies continually scan the blockchain to identify suspicious transaction activity.\n\n\" The Blockchain Intelligence Group estimates that illegal transactions in bitcoin fell from ~50% of total volume in 2015\nto ~20% in 2016, and represent “significantly less than that” today.\n\n= As law enforcement has become better able to track bitcoin ransom, cybercriminals have begun to favor currencies that\nallow anonymity, such as Monero and Zcash, and even Ether.\n\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Blockchain Intelligence Group, https://www.cnbc.com/201 7/08/29/dark-web-finds-bitcoin-increasingly-more-of-a-problem-than-a-help-tries-other- rl\ndigital-currencies.html.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025674",
