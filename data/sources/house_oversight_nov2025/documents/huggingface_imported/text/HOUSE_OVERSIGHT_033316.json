(The Washington Post)\n\nBob Woodward, an associate editor at The Washington Post, sought an interview with\n\nPresident Trump as he was writing “Fear,” a book about Trump’s presidency. Trump\ncalled Woodward in early August, after the manuscript had been completed, to say he\n\nwanted to participate.\n\nOver the course of 11-plus minutes, Trump repeatedly claimed his White House staff\n\nhadn’t informed him of Woodward’s interview request — despite also admitting Sen.\n\nLindsey Graham (R-S.C.) had told him Woodward wanted to talk. He also started the\nphone call by saying Woodward had “always been fair” to him, but by the end he said\nthe book would be “inaccurate.”\n\nThis is a transcript of that call, with key sections highlighted and annotated. To see an\nannotation, click on the yellow, highlighted text.\n\nTrump: Hello, Bob.\n\nBW: President Trump, how are you?\n\nTrump: How are you? How are you doing? Okay?\n\nBW: Real well. I’m turning on my tape recorder, with your permission.\nTrump: Oh, that’s okay. That’s okay. I don’t mind that at all.\n\nBW: I’m sorry we missed the opportunity to talk for the book.\n\nTrump: Well, I just spoke with Kellyanne [Conway] and she asked me if I gota call. I\nnever got a call. I never got a message. Who did you ask about speaking to me?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_033316",
