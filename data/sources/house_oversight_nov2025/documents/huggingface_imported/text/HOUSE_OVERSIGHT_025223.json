  "text": "Eye on the Market July 25, 2011\n\nJ.P Morgan\n\nTopics: US debt ceiling negotiations, a more ambitious European bailout plan (finally), and how large cap growth stocks\nand rising corporate profits are patiently waiting for both of them to end\n\nWhat the EU gave: an easing of lending conditions, and an expanded role for the EU lending facility (EFSF)\n\n* Another 109 bn for Greece, allowing the country to continue to pay off maturing debt (to those not participating in the exchanges)\n\n* Rate on new EU loans to Greece, Portugal and Ireland cut to 3.5%, maturities on new & old loans extended from 7.5 to 15-30 years\n* 10 year grace period on interest on new EU loans to Greece; the unpaid interest accumulates\n\n* EU loan facility has the ability to buy sovereign debt in the secondary markets, including a plan to purchase 40 bn of Greek debt\n(most likely including much of the Greek debt purchased by the ECB)\n\n* EU loan facility has the ability to lend to countries (even those not in an IMF program) to recapitalize their banks\n\n* Language (with no specifics) regarding the use of EU structural funds to boost growth in Greece\n\nWhat the EU gets: more austerity, Maastricht with teeth (?) and private sector involvement in Greek debt rollover\n\n* Legally binding national fiscal framework to be developed by end of 2012; fiscal deficits brought to 3% by 2013 at the latest\n\n* Private sector involvement in Greek debt rollover, committed in principle by 30 financial institutions listed in the document released\nby the Institute of International Finance; target participation rate of 90%; exchange appears to result in Selective Default credit rating\n* Voluntary participation options include exchanging existing debt into 15 or 30 year bond with AAA-guarantees of principal. Bonds\nexchanged at par will carry low coupons (4.25% effective), while bonds with higher coupons will be exchanged at a 20% discount\nSource: Eurozone draft proposal July 21, 2011, IIF press release July 21, 2011\n\nIn addition to execution risk in Greece, we are left with\n3 other concerns. First, while there’s enough in the EU-\nIMF lending facility* to deal with problems in Greece,\nPortugal and Ireland, if you include Spain, it gets tight\n(note: the chart excludes costs to recapitalize banks). If\nItaly or Belgium entered Europe’s Liquidity Hospital, a lot\nmore money might be needed from European parliaments\n\nLimited capacity at the European Liquidity Hospital\nOfficial sector lending capacity vs sovereign funding needs (including\ndeficits) through 2013 - Billions, EUR\n\n1,800\n\n1,600\n1,400\n1,200\n1,000\n\n800\n\nGreece package\n\n(in one worst-case scenario, Alliance Bernstein estimates\nthat the EU lending facility would have to increase from\n440 bn to 1.7 trillion Euros, mostly from Germany). Italy\n\nes EFSM\n\n600\n400\n200\n\nfaces a multi-notch downgrade from Moody’s, which is\nnot going to help. As we discussed two weeks ago, Italy\nhas been a model citizen in terms of running low budget\ndeficits for 20 years, but still cannot escape the confines of\nits very large existing debt stock (120% of GDP).\n\nGreece,\nPortugal, Ireland\n\nTotal lending\ncapacity\n\nPlus Spain Plus Italy and\n\nBelgium\n\n; Possible sovereign borrowing needs from official sources\nSource: AllianceBernstein, Public Filings.\n\nSecond, as shown below, Europe is now a two-speed economy, with the periphery stuck in neutral (industrial production is one\nproxy for this; there are others, such as unemployment, consumption, export shares, etc). Ifthe idea behind the EU/IMF effort\nis that austerity will boost growth and lead these countries back to the public markets, there is very little momentum in this\ndirection. If the status quo in the periphery does not change, all the EU package does is allow the current approach\n\nmore time to fail.\n\nIndustrial production\nIndex, 100 = January 2007\n110\n\n105\n100\n95\n90\n85\n80\n\n15\n2007 2009 2010 2011\nSource: INE, CSO, ISTAT, NSS, Eurostat, Bundesbank, J.P.
