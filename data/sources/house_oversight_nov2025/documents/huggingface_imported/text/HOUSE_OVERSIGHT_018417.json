  "text": "traditional thinking. Co-evolution exists as a real possibility for the two nations but\nso too does co-extinction, a problem of mis-designed complex systems that can\nrattle themselves apart. This is precisely what a confident Hard Gatekeeping\nstrategy can avoid. When we speak of the possibiltity of a new type of great power\nrelations it is because so much of future power will be decided on a topological\nlandscapes, on that nearly living surface that is marked by such different rules than\nthe older, industrial power maps. It takes a network to fight a network, as we’ve\nsaid.\n\nNetworks confront us, constantly now, with the unexpected. No one forming the IMF\nin 1949 considered digital currency. No one developing arms protocols in the 1990s\nthought about cyber weapons. Artificially intelligent weapons, migrant waves,\nincome fractures - these and other emerging puzzles were never contemplated in\nour existing international arrangements. Collectively attacking these challenges is\nnot merely more efficient; it is our only option. Yes, it’s easy enough to picture the\nUS and China battling each other over islands and protocols and technology\nstructures in the decades to come. Certainly this possibility has to be prepared for.\nBut this is to regard the world in industrial terms. Ask yourself: What, really is the\npoint of power? It is to secure stability, not to tip the world to chaos just because we\nthink we might be better off on the other side. The networks tell us what they want.\nThey want gates. Our only question - and it is the same question that lingers in\nBeijing and Washington - is: Are we smart enough to listen?\n\n5.\n\nHow will power distribute itself in the future? Just what will the network of nations\nand datawebs and insurgents finally look like when it settles into some predictable\nif still roiling order ten or a hundred years hence? Will it be made up of different\nwalled and gated systems, linked at certain moments, unplugged at others? Or might\nit collect with that “winner take all” logic we've seen firing along the most efficient\nnetworks? Most traditional foreign policy looks at history and sees the constant,\nviolent rocking of a “balance of power”. Nations thirst for security, they vie with one\nanother for influence, resources, and control. France rises. Statesmen in Berlin,\nVienna and London conspire to knock her down. This is the order that dominated\nEurope for much of the last 500 years. But history is also filled with enduring, stable\narrangements - moments where the balance settles a bit and a single power\ndominates. Asia, Europe, the Middle East, South America - each produced nations\nthat stretched mastery the system for generations, for centuries even. If you map the\nrise and fall of nations and empires over the past 4,000 years - as the political\nscientists Stuart Kauffman, Richard Little and William Wohlforth once attempted in\nan heroic statistical effort - about half of human history has been marked by this\nsort of hegemonic stability. China led East Asia’s order from 1300 to 1900, for\ninstance. The Japanese and Koreans and Vietnamese all found it was wiser to play by\nChina’s rules than to attack her. Assyrian imperial arrangements overmastered a\ndozen smaller states from the 9 to 7 centuries BCE. The Dehli Sultinate managed\nhegemony in South Asia from 12 to 14 centuries. The Mughals owned nearly two\n\n185\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018417",
