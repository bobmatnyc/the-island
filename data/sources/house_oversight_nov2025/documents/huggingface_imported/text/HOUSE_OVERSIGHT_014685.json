  "text": "Case 9:Gase-bd PaevOKS ERM cRegumenhesee of HeGOLINGLE: Ragr/AOiof Ibage 9 of 10\n\nid. at 10). Petitioners do not contend that Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4’s “participation in this\ncase” can only be achieved by listing them as parties.\n\nAs it stands under the original petition, the merits of this case will be decided based on a\ndetermination of whether the Government violated the rights of Jane Doe 1, Jane Doe 2, and all\n“other similarly situated victims” under the CVRA. Jane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 may offer\nrelevant, admissible, and non-cumulative evidence that advances that determination, but their\nparticipation as listed parties is not necessary in that regard. See Herring, 894 F.2d at 1024\n(District court did not abuse its discretion by denying amendment where “addition of more\nplaintiffs .. . would not have affected the issues underlying the grant of summary judgment.”); cf.\nArthur v. Stern, 2008 WL 2620116, at *7 (S.D. Tex. 2008) (Under Rule 15, “courts have held\nthat leave to amend to assert a claim already at issue in [another lawsuit] should not be granted if\nthe same parties are involved, the same substantive claim is raised, and the same relief is\nsought.”)” And, as to Jane Doe 4 at least, adding her as a party raises unnecessary questions\nabout whether she is a proper party to this action.®\n\nPetitioners also admit that amending the petition to conform to the evidence by\nincluding references to the non-prosecution agreement itself is “unnecessary” as the “existing\n\npetition is broad enough to cover the developing evidence in this case.” (DE 311). The Court\n\n> The Court expresses no opinion at this time whether any of the attestations made by\nJane Doe 3 and Jane Doe 4 in support of their motion will be relevant, admissible, and non-\ncumulative.\n\n° The Government contends that Jane Doe 4 is not a true “victim” in this case because\nshe was not known at the time the Government negotiated the non-prosecution agreement, and\naccordingly she was not entitled to notification rights under the CVRA. (See DE 290 at 10).\nAny “duplicative” litigation filed by Jane Doe 4 would necessarily raise the issue of whether she\nhas standing under the CVRA under these circumstances.\n\n9\n\nGIUFFRE002852\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014685",
