  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n803\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nduct of ostensible charities under the\nKingdom’s control.” Federal Opp. to Mo-\ntion to Dismiss of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia at 12° Thus, the Federal Plaintiffs\nclaim the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia aided\nand abetted the terrorists through these\ncharities. In attempting to overcome the\npresumption of the Kingdom’s sovereign\nimmunity, the Federal Plaintiffs argue the\nmerits of their claims against the chari-\nties.\" Based on news accounts that the\nKingdom has dissolved its international\ncharities and terrorist financing reports\nthat implicate certain charities, the Feder-\nal Plaintiffs urge the Court to find that the\nKingdom had previously willfully ignored\nthe charities’ support for terrorism. See,\ne.g. Federal Opp. to Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia Motion to Dismiss Ex. 2 (“Terrorist\nFinancing, Report of an Independent Task\nForce Sponsored by the Council on For-\neion Relations”), Ex. 3 (CNN.com June 2,\n2004 “Saudis reform charities as antiterror\nmeasure” (mentioning only Al Haramain\nIslamic Foundation)), Ex. 5 (Senate Sub-\ncommittee Testimony, July 31, 2003 by\nSteven Emerson with Jonathan Levin,\n“Terrorism Financing: Origination, Or-\nganization, and Prevention: Saudi Arabia,\nTerrorist Financing and the War on Ter-\nror”).\n\n30. The Federal Plaintiffs allege that each of\nthe following charities, which are all named\nas Defendants and represented by counsel in\nthese actions, are agencies, instrumentalities,\narms or organs of the Kingdom: MWL, IIRO,\nWAMY, Al Haramain Islamic Foundation, Sa-\nudi High Commission for Relief to Bosnia and\nHerzegovina, SJRC, Rabita Trust, Saudi Red\nCrescent, and BIF. The Kingdom disputes the\ninstrumentality status of MWL, ITRO, WAMY,\nAl Haramain Islamic Foundation, Rabita\nTrust, and BIF. These Plaintiffs request dis-\ncovery as to the instrumentality status of these\ncharities. The request is denied at this time\nand may be more appropriate when the Court\nconsiders each of the charities’ motions to\ndismiss.\n\nIn response, the Kingdom argues that\nPlaintiffs ignore Osama bin Laden’s public\ntargeting of the Kingdom. See, e.g., Bier-\nstein Aff. in Opp. to Prince Sultan’s Motion\nto Dismiss, Ex. 3 & 4; The 9/11 Commis-\nston Report: Final Report of the National\nCommission on Terrorist Attacks Upon\nthe United States, 48, 373 (July 2004)\n(hereinafter “9/11 Report”). The King-\ndom also submits it has worked with the\nUnited States to share information in the\nfight against terrorism. 9/11 Report, at\n115-22; Prince Turki Decl. 117, 8, 10.\nThe U.S. State Department has not desig-\nnated the Kingdom a state sponsor of ter-\nrorism. Additionally, the presidentially-\nappointed September 11 commission found\nno evidence of the Kingdom’s funding or\nsupport for the September 11 terrorists.\n9/11 Report, at 171 (““[Wle have found no\nevidence that the Saudi government as an\ninstitution or senior Saudi officials individ-\nually funded the organization.”).\n\nThe Court finds the Plaintiffs’ allega-\ntions cannot overcome the discretionary\nfunction exception to the tortious acts ex-\nception. Marchisella v. Gov't of Japan,\n2004 WL 307248, at *2 (explaining acts\nperformed at the planning, as opposed to\noperational, level of government are pro-\ntected by immunity); Robinson, 269 F.3d\nat 146 (noting conclusory nature of allega-\n\n31. Rather than pleading specific facts show-\ning that the Kingdom caused Plaintiffs’ inju-\nries, the Federal Plaintiffs focus predominant-\nly on the charities’ actions. For example,\nthese Plaintiffs argue that the Kingdom has\nwaived the defense of sovereign immunity be-\ncause certain charities, which have not been\ndesignated as instrumentalities of the King-\ndom and which are represented by separate\ncounsel, did not raise the FSIA defense in\n\nThe Court is not\n\nconvinced by this argument because the waiv-\n\ner of FSIA immunity must be explicit. See\n\nBanco de Seguros del Estado v. Mutual Marine\n\nOffice, Inc., 344 F.3d 255, 261 (2d Cir.2003).\n\ntheir motions to dismiss.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017868",
