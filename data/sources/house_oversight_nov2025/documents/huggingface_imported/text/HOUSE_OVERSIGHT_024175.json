  "text": "Hedge funds\n\nUBS View Prefer Relative value and Event-driven\n° We expect hedge funds (HF) to offer positive asymmetric returns characteristics vs. the S&P 500 due to\nactive management and stop-loss strategies. (HF were down 1.9% in May 2012 vs MSCI world at -8.5%)\n\n¢ Decelerating global growth prospects, the next leg in the ongoing Eurozone crisis, is challenging mostly\nequity long-short managers, who are net-long the market. While event-driven managers share some of\nthe performance drivers, idiosyncratic bets (event) reduce the exposure to markets. The real reason to own\nthis strategy, however, is the potential for out-sized return in distressed, high yield and other credit\ninvestments as the Eurozone crisis plays out. The inherent hedging in relative-value should remain\nappealing. Credit relative-value managers should perform well in this environment of higher fixed income\nvolatility and increasing pricing anomalies created by central bank interventions (OT2) and limited\ncompetition.\n\nA Positive scenario Prefer Equity long-short\n\n¢ A reduction of uncertainty (e.g. resolution in Europe) lowers equities' correlation and volatility. This\nhelps bottom-up fundamental analysis and equity long/short managers the most. Also, CEOs will likely\nmake more corporate transactions that can be monetized by event-driven managers, and a clearer\nmacroeconomic environment with more persistent trends would be supportive for macro managers\n\nNegative scenario Prefer Trading (Global Macro + CTA)\ne A 2011-type scenario in which hedge fund managers get whipsawed through the year with risk-on and\nrisk-off circumstances, driven by a multitude of political interventions, is difficult to anticipate. That would\nimpact long-short managers, event-driven, and to a lesser extent global macro managers.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nGlobal equity direction The outlook for global equities becomes an important HF performance driver.\n/ economic cycle The economic cycle impacts the strategies differently.\n\nCorrelation Correlation among pair-stocks; an important performance/alpha driver for\nequity long/short, the largest HF strategy by assets under management.\n\nLeverage Gross and net leverage are key to monitoring risk.\n\nVolatility The direction influences certain HF strategies (e.g. convertible arbitrage).\n\nLiquidity Particularly for large HF that are less nimble to enter and exit their strategies\n\nRegulation Volcker's rule, USCITS III/IV\n\n36 UBS\n\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\nActive risk management is instrumental for\ncapital preservation during adverse market\nconditions. At the moment, we therefore\nfavor relative value and event-driven\nstrategies, since they are less hinged to\nequity markets and other risky assets than\ntrading is.\n\nValue proposition: Hedge funds should\nachieve robust performance over an\nextended horizon, while displaying limited\nvolatility vis-a-vis equities and other risky\nassets, in general. Hedge funds minimize\ndownside losses in adverse market\nconditions (e.g. active risk management)\nand play a crucial role in wealth\nappreciation, since there is less ground to\nregain in the recovery phase and\nultimately greater chances for superior\nlong-term returns.\n\nPerformance (year-to-date)\n\nRelative value\n\nEvent driven\n\nEquity hedge\n\nHedge Funds\n\nTrading\n\n1.0% 0.5% 0.0% 05% 1.0% 1.5% 20% 25% 3.0% 3.5% 40%\n\nSource: HFRI, UBS CIO, as of 18 June 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n40\n\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Cesare Valeggia, cesare.valeggia@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024175",
