So, your Honor, I\nsubmit that to you for what it doesn't say from Ms. Maxwell\nsince they've provided that to you today.\n\nThere are a few more things that I just want to touch\n\non that I think need to be clarified, and that is, with respect\n\nto -- there was this mention about newspaper articles, and as\n\nyou know we've submitted an expert who analyzed through his web\n\nanalytics, he's the sam xpert that was in the Anders case who\n\nfollowed that video of the Fox reporter over the internet and\n\ntracked that he uses a well-accepted methodology. We've set\n\nthat forth all in our papers.\n\nBut he tracked the specific quoted statements, your\n\nHonor. And if they have an issue, if they want to say, oh,\n\nthey're proposing today that these articles related to the\n\nDershowitz matter, that's subject for cross examination of him\nif they want, but he has a very clear methodology, and those\narticles that he tracked were in that manner, your Honor, so I\njust want to make that point since they raised it. I know\nwe're not discussing the experts in detail today, but I did ask\nthat question.\n\nSo your Honor, in just summarizing on those points, I\n\nthink we made clear in our opening argument why we believe that\n\nthis shouldn't be subject to a number of mini trials ona\n\nvariety of these issues, we're hoping to streamline this\n\nmatter, and that's why we proposed this motion in limine to you\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011381",
