  "text": "| Played Thomas Jefferson’ s Violin\n\nAt a unique Heroes Convention, | met Lindsay Wagner, star of 7he\n\nBionic Woman. She was unaware that the CIA served as technical adviser\nto her series, but she spoke poignantly of the positive influence that her\nTV alter-ego had on young amputees she visited in hospitals.\n\n| also met Tom Laughlin, of Bi//y Jack movie fame. A couple of years\nlater, he and his wife Delores Taylor invited me to a large dinner party.\n\nThey were Thomas Jefferson enthusiasts. In their home, there was\nThomas Jefferson's furniture, Thomas Jefferson's silverware, Thomas\nJefferson's recipes--we started with peanut soup--and even Thomas\nJefferson's violin.\n\n| mentioned playing the violin as a child, and Laughlin invited me to\nplay this one. | hadn't held a violin for twenty-five years, not since | had\nused it as a prop when | started doing stand-up comedy, and four decades\nhad passed since that concert in Carnegie Hall. It felt like a previous\nincarnation. But now Billy Jack himself was handing me Thomas Jefferson's\nviolin. How could | resist?\n\n“I'd like to dedicate this to Thomas Jefferson's slaves,” | said.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015460",
