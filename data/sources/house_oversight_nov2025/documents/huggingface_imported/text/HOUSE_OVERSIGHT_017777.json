Sometimes the technique worked, but other times it didn’t, and the unwitting\nrecipients found themselves exiled to coach. (Epstein has claimed that he paid for the upgrades,\nand had no knowledge of the stickers.) Many of those who benefited from Epstein’s largesse\nclaim that his generosity comes with no strings attached. “I never felt he wanted anything from\nme in return,” says one old friend, who received a first-class upgrade.\n\nEpstein is known about town as a man who loves women—lots of them, mostly young. Model\ntypes have been heard saying they are full of gratitude to Epstein for flying them around, and he\nis a familiar face to many of the Victoria’s Secret girls. One young woman recalls being\nsummoned by Ghislaine Maxwell to a concert at Epstein’s town house, where the women\nseemed to outnumber the men by far. “These were not women you’d see at Upper East Side\ndinners,” the woman recalls. “Many seemed foreign and dressed a little bizarrely.” This same\nguest also attended a cocktail party thrown by Maxwell that Prince Andrew attended, which was\nfilled, she says, with young Russian models. “Some of the guests were horrified,” the woman\nsays.\n\n“He’s reckless,” says a former business associate, “and he’s gotten more so. Money does that to\nyou. He’s breaking the oath he made to himself—that he would never do anything that would\nexpose him in the media. Right now, in the wake of the publicity following his trip with Clinton,\nhe must be in a very difficult place.”\n\nAccording to S.E.C. and other legal documents unearthed by VANITY FAIR, Epstein may have\ngood reason to keep his past cloaked in secrecy: his real mentor, it might seem, was not Leslie\nWexner but Steven Jude Hoffenberg, 57, who, for a few months before the S.E.C. sued to freeze\nhis assets in 1993, was trying to buy the New York Post. He is currently incarcerated in the\nFederal Medical Center in Devens, Massachusetts, serving a 20-year sentence for bilking\ninvestors out of more than $450 million in one of the largest Ponzi schemes in American history.\n\nWhen Epstein met Hoffenberg in London in the 1980s, the latter was the charismatic, audacious\nhead of the Towers Financial Corporation, a collection agency that was supposed to buy debts\nthat people owed to hospitals, banks, and phone companies. But Hoffenberg began using\ncompany funds to pay off earlier investors and service a lavish lifestyle that included a mansion\non Long Island, homes on Manhattan’s Sutton Place and in Florida, and a fleet of cars and\nplanes.\n\nHoffenberg and Epstein had much in common. Both were smart and obsessed with making\nmoney. Both were from Brooklyn. According to Hoffenberg, the two men were introduced by\nDouglas Leese, a defense contractor. Epstein has said they were introduced by John Mitchell, the\nlate attorney general.\n\nEpstein had been running International Assets Group Inc. (I.A.G.), a consulting company, out of\nhis apartment in the Solo building on East 66th Street in New York. Though he has claimed that\nhe managed money for billionaires only, in a 1989 deposition he testified that he spent 80\npercent of his time assisting people recover stolen money from fraudulent brokers and lawyers.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017777",
