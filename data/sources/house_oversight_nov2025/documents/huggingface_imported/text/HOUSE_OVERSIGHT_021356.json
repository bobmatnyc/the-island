  "text": "Personifications of God\n\nJonathan Edwards wrote during a\ntime in which monarchs reigned\nsupreme. Writing from this perspective,\nhe argued that the universe is a cosmic\nsociety organized under the leadership of\na King of kings, a society against which\nhumans have rebelled and, as a\nconsequence, humans are at risk of\nannihilation except for the mercy of the\nKing. Judgment day will come,\naccording to Edwards, and those who\nhave failed to meet their moral\nresponsibility to the directive of the\nuniverse face eternal isolation. Clark\nGilpin notes that by conjuring up a\npersonified God — a God with emotions,\nintentions, and the capacity to act —\nEdwards instilled great fear and\ntrembling in his listeners that\npresumably motivated them to change\ntheir behaviors in the desired direction.\nIt is hard to imagine that Edwards would\nhave had comparable success had he\nresorted to simple instructions or\nexhortations to engage in certain\nbehaviors and avoid others. The innate\ntendency of people to understand divine\nentities in terms of what people do\nunderstand, namely their own thoughts,\nfeelings, and beliefs, provided the\nleverage on which Edwards relied to\ndrive his message home.\n\nTanya Luhrmann also discusses a\npersonalized construction of God — a\nGod with whom one can consult and\nwho intervenes in one’s daily life.\nPeople are intrinsically motivated to\nform social connections, and very little\nin life is more rewarding to people than\ntheir social relationships. Luhrmann,\nwho adopts the perspective of a\nparticipant observer, finds that a new\nevangelical Protestant movement, the\nVineyard Church, appeals to this\n\nPage |110\n\nmotivation to depict God as one’s\npersonal guide and friend, well within\none’s sensory reach. By conjuring up an\nanthropomorphic God with loving\nemotions, intentions, and actions, the\nVineyard Church creates a desire for a\npersonal relationship with God. But\ndeveloping a relationship with an\ninvisible God defies rationality. People\nmust learn how to transform an abstract\nconcept of an invisible God into a\nconcrete sensory presence in their lives.\nJust as the social brain can perceive\nnonhuman objects as human, the social\nbrain is also capable of selectively\nattending to sensory experiences and\ninterpreting these sensations as God’s\npresence.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021356",
