I pity those of you who lack submissive tendencies.\n\nJust because anything on the Internet can and will be misread, I will conclude this post by\nhammering down the point that this is all a thought experiment, and I do not actually\nthink vanilla people are any less wonderful than S&M people. It's okay vanilla folks.\nI love you just the way you are.\n\nte Kk ok\nThis post can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2011/06/21/sm-superpowers/\n\nS&M:\n[theory] BDSM Can Be \"Love Sex\" Too\n\nIn early 2011, my fellow sex blogger Rachel Rabbit White asked me to participate in her\ninitiative \"Lady Porn Day.\" This was the result. There's a list of relevant links at the end\nof the online version of this article.\n\nte Ok ok\n\nBDSM Can Be \"Love Sex\" Too\n\nI'm not a big porn consumer, but I have no problem with porn in itself. When I have a\nproblem with porn, it's because I have a problem with how it was made: because there are\nlabor issues, or questions of the actors' consent. Sometimes, I get frustrated with the\ncontext in which porn exists or the stereotypes it expresses -- but there, the problem is\nwith the context and the stereotypes, not with porn in itself. I tend to think that most anti-\nporn anxiety arises from irrational grossed-out reactions and stereotype-created fears, and\nI try to open up conversations about the ethics of making porn whenever I can.\n\nThis isn't to say I don't get angry because many people in our society are pressured to\nhave sex that doesn't work for them -- but that's not the fault of porn. I certainly get\nfrustrated by sexual stereotypes, but I don't think porn created those stereotypes.\n\nOne stereotype I've been thinking about a lot lately -- one that I see expressed over and\nover in BDSM porn -- is the idea that BDSMers don't love our partners, or that love can't\nbe part of a BDSM relationship. Here's a quotation from Pat Califia's Speaking Sex To\nPower that touches on this (note: contains spoilers about the endings of three famous\nBDSM novels -- Story of O, Return to the Chateau and Nine And A Half Weeks):\n\nI still remember how crushed I was when I read Story of O and Return to the Chateau\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018489",
