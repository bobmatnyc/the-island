Check\nout the website if you have a black and white book. It is an irrelevant\nquestion to ask if my red is the same as yours, since my red against one\nbackground is not even the same as my red against another.\n\nPeople generally agree on naming colors but not all languages have\nthe eleven specifically named colors of modern English: black, blue,\nbrown, gray, green, orange, pink, purple, red, white, yellow, if you are\ninterested. Ancient Celtic languages, so called ‘grw languages, recognized\nonly four colors and other languages don’t distinguish purple from blue.\nColor, or at least the naming of color, is a cultural thing.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015801",
