  "text": "17\n\n\"The number of Palestinians living west of the Jordan River is\ngrowing rapidly and fundamentally reshaping the demographic\nrealities of both Israel and the Palestinian territories,\" Obama told\nmembers of AIPAC, the pro-Israel lobbying group, on May 22. \"This\nwill make it harder and harder, without a peace deal, to maintain\nIsrael as both a Jewish state and a democratic state.\"\n\nAn eternal truth of Middle East politics is that the Palestinians never\nmiss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Lately, though, this has\nbecome an Israeli specialty. If Israel misses the chance this year to set\nthe Palestinians on a course toward independence, it will jeopardize\nits future as a Jewish democracy.\n\nA Magnanimous Vision\n\nYes, it will be dangerous for Israel to return to its 1967 borders, or\nanything close. The potential merger between Hamas and the more\nmoderate Fatah is cause for despair, but it should spur Netanyahu to\ntry to split the moderates from the radicals by offering a\nmagnanimous vision for peace. He should realize that it will be fatal\nfor Israel to maintain control over millions of Palestinians who seek\nwhat the people of Yemen and Libya and Syria seek: freedom.\nAbsent any hope of progress, the Palestinians will do what they can\nto undermine Israel. But all they have to do is wait.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023533",
