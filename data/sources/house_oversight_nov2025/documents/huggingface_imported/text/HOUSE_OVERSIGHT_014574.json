Similarly, residential\ninvestment is set to contribute, reflected in the\n\nNational Association of Home Builders (NAHB)\nhousing market index reaching a post-crisis high in\nDecember of last year (see Exhibit 37). Overall, we\nexpect this momentum to continue as the erstwhile\neasing in financial conditions provides a growth\ntailwind throughout 2017 (see Exhibit 38).\n\nA Resilient US Consumer\n\nThe stars are aligned for US consumers in 2017,\nas they enter the year with rising wages, higher\nnet worth from asset price gains, historically\nlow debt-servicing costs, ample savings and\nconfidence at a 12-year high. They also stand to\nbenefit directly from potentially lower tax rates\nand indirectly from higher fiscal spending, a\ntopic we discuss in the next section. The above-\nmentioned factors should mitigate the headwind\nfrom higher inflation. Overall, we expect private\nconsumption—a key driver of our GDP forecast—\nto expand at a pace of approximately 2.5%.\n\nSupportive Policy\n\nWhile government policy is always a source of\nuncertainty, it is even more so in 2017 given\npotential changes to tax, trade and immigration\npolicies in the wake of last year’s presidential\nelection. Nonetheless, our base case is that policy\nultimately supports growth this year, with some\nfiscal expansion and a measured pace of Federal\nReserve rate hikes.
