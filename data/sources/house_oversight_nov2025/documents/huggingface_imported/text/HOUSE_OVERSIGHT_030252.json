  "text": "few restraints about the way he deals with his adversaries. He could act\nunilaterally and shut down the investigation, forcing a legal test likely\nbefore the Supreme Court. He could order the Attorney General—even\ngiven his prior recusal—to repeal the Special Counsel regulations and\nclose down the investigation, and fire him if he refused. Or he could fire\nRosenstein and seek someone else to oversee the investigation in ways\nmore to his liking. The Mueller team continues to believe it is protected\nby political realities—the President can not know how Congress might\nrespond, and it might well respond with impeachment. At the same\ntime, it has tried to game out the uncharted legal areas of exactly what\nhappens to all of its \"work product\" and to the sitting grand juries if the\ninvestigation is in fact shut down or its mission altered.\n\nLikewise, people around the President—embracing a\nconstitutional face-off as militantly as they maintain the Mueller\ninvestigation is—say this unknown legal area that might be\nadvantageous to the President. The delays and disruption that result as\ncourts sort out the ramifications of the President's actions might well be\nthe President's legal friend—the reason some in the White House have\nbeen urging the President to end the investigation, whatever the\npolitical fallout.\n\nThe President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some\nof the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel. The\nCounsel's office believes the President will use his pardon power as an\ninstrument to undermine the investigation.\n\nAccording to present and former White House advisors, the\nPresident's recent spate of pardons are in part his way of taunting the\nSpecial Counsel. The White House, according to these sources, is aware\nthat the Special Counsel has concluded the President's pardon power is\nnear absolute: the President can certainly pardon himself, and others\ninvolved in the investigation.\n\nMost immediately, the Special Counsel's office believes that the\nPresident will pardon Michael Flynn, perhaps in the coming weeks. The\nquestion for the Mueller team is if it can build an exception to the\nPresident's pardon authority. It’s view here falls back on the\negregiousness of the President's own behavior: there is a level of\nobstruction of justice that all reasonable men might know when they\nsee it. If you pardon someone to get yourself off the hook, that's\nobstruction, and subverting the rule of law and the constitution you've\npledged to uphold.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030252",
