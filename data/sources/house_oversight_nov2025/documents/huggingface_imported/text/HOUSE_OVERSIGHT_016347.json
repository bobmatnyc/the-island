  "text": "Venki Ramakrishnan is a Nobel Prize-winning biologist whose many scientific\ncontributions include his work on the atomic structure of the ribosome—in effect, a huge\nmolecular machine that reads our genes and makes proteins. His work would have been\nimpossible without powerful computers. The Internet made his own work a lot easier\nand, he notes, acted as a leveler internationally: “When I grew up in India, if you wanted\nto get a book, it would show up six months or a year after it had already come out in the\nWest. ... Journals would arrive by surface mail a few months later. I didn’t have to\ndeal with it, because I left India when I was nineteen, but I know Indian scientists had to\ndeal with it. Today they have access to information at the click of a button. More\nimportant, they have access to lectures. They can listen to Richard Feynman. That\nwould have been a dream of mine when I was growing up. They can just watch Richard\nFeynman on the Web. That’s a big leveling in the field.” And yet... “Along with the\nbenefits [of the Web], there is now a huge amount of noise. You have all of these people\nspouting pseudoscientific jargon and pushing their own ideas as if they were science.”\n\nAs president of the Royal Society, Venki worries, too, about the broader issue of\ntrust: public trust in evidence-based scientific findings, but also trust among scientists,\nbolstered by rigorous checking of one another ’s conclusions—trust that is in danger of\neroding because of the “black box” character of deep-learning computers. “This\n[erosion] is going to happen more and more, as data sets get bigger, as we have genome-\nwide studies, population studies, and all sorts of things,” he says. “How do we, as a\nscience community, grapple with this and communicate to the public a sense of what\nscience is about, what is reliable in science, what is uncertain in science, and what is just\nplain wrong in science?”\n\n127\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016347",
