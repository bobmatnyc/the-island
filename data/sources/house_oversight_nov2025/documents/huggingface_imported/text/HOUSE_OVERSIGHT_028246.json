After all, it was\nHamas attacks that provided the spearhead of the intifada of terror launched in the\nwake of Camp David. Arafat’s own influence was also inexorably on the wane by\nthe time he passed away, in Paris, at the end of 2004, to be succeeded by Abu\nMazen. I do not know of a single senior figure in Israel with any military\nexperience who believes that we would be more secure today if we still had\nthousands of soldiers and settlers inside Gaza. Surprised though I was by Arik’s\ndecision to leave, I had no doubt that the fundamental security judgment he was\nmaking — that a disengagement was in Israel’s own interest — was the right one. I\nwas encouraged, too, by his parallel announcement of a small, token withdrawal\nfrom a few small West Bank settlements. My regret at the time was that he did not\ngo further toward the kind of major West Bank disengagement I’d been arguing\nfor, and that even in Gaza the pullout seemed insufficiently prepared or thought\nout. The model, I believed, should have been our withdrawal from Lebanon —\ninvolving detailed prior consultation with, and political support from, the UN and\nkey international allies. I also felt it was critically important to ensure that, while\nwe would obviously need offshore patrols to prevent arms and munitions from\ngetting in, we allowed and encouraged an environment in which the Gazan\neconomy could function and grow after we left. None of that happened. Though we\nleft Gaza, we effectively sealed off and blockaded one of the most densely\npopulated, economically strapped and politically febrile strips of land on the face\nof the earth.\n\nStill, I did see it as an important first step toward the kind of wider\ndisengagement that would prioritize Israel’s own security interests, and political\nand social cohesiveness, until and unless conditions allowed a for a serious new\neffort for a final peace deal. I was heartened when Shimon led Labor back into\nArik’s coalition at the start of 2005 to ensure he’d have the support necessary to go\nthrough with the Gaza withdrawal. And while I did make a brief attempt to return\nas party leader later in the year, when it was clear I wasn’t going to win, I threw\nmy support behind Shimon and against the other challenger, the longtime labor-\nunion leader Amir Peretz, who was running on a platform to take Labor out of\nSharon’s government.\n\nBut Peretz won the leadership election. He did leave the cabinet, forcing Arik to\ncall an early election for March 2006. And that, along with the most ambitious and\n\n398\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028246",
