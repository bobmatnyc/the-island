Along with your \"\npayment \"last year we agreed . no further obligations on each side. yes, i continued to moan. I realize\nthat though Ive done quite a lot this year already _, it is not your responsibility. . As you often like to\nremind me- you've paid a great deal of money to date. that being said - If you want my involvement\nmoving foward, Isuggest you pay my regular | fee of 40 m. 20 now . 20 on completion or as per the\ninvoice issues at the end of last year pay 30 all at once. -\n\nTo help out .im keenly aware of your current cash position. so I will consider an in-kind payment -\nreal estate ( Miami ), ,art , financing of my new plane (allows you to spread over years or of course the\npreferred cash. Get rid of Castrucci,it is over a year since the same story of findign the right guy at the\ntop. youentire accounting needs to be re done. , office downsized, reporting re done. meetings to\nrecitify, categlorize , the various docs re appollo , rowen , suydam, alan etc. Brad can direct investment\nguys, ( hopefully) my people will be in your office for a few months . reorganizing IF you decide not to\npay I fully understand, as Im sure you will re my no longer spending any serious time on these things.\nOf course re any non financial issues , I am always there for you and will continue to be the best friend I\ncan be.\n\nSteve jobs said that everyday he woke up , and asked himself , if he knew he was going to die tomorow ,\nwould he do the same thing that he had planned for the day- he wanted to check that he was doing things\nthat he really wanted to. after three days of getting back an answer of no, he would change what he was\ngoing to do. . he also did not believe in LONG term plans. I dont think either one of us will figure out\nwhat we want to do long term so my thinking is that we should try to have fun everyday, and welcome\nserendipity.\n\nI think another trust and estate lawyer should be brought in to deal with the issues of how not to allow\nyour family to get screwed by your partners on death.
