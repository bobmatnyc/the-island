  "text": "3. Insights and strategy counts. Discount opinions of elite. Get to the street to\nunderstand. Hire locals. Be local.\n\n4. Act while the going is good. Cost of operating KSA has gone from $12/barrel\nto $85/barrel. KSA is not financially sustainable with these expenditures.\n\n5. Governance is not fit for purpose in many countries. KSA is unable to solve\nproblems particularly where it requires cross — ministerial action. Too many\ncivil servants.\n\nCritical issues for region:\n\n1. Employment\n\n2. Education for employment\n\n3. Economic model needs to be fixed\n\n4. Housing. Huge social issue because inadequate housing means the 20-30\nyear olds stay at home and that is bad social policy.\n\nMike Froman (Dpty NSA)\nGlass half empty. Serious financial difficulty ahead. Populace policies adopted to\nquell people. This includes expenditures and that become embedded as\nentitlements. (I refrained from asking him if that sounded like another country we\nknow). MENA’s export market is Europe which means they will experience\nsoftness. All of this has the makings of a serious financial crisis in the region. We\nare seeing the beginning of a multi-decade set of issues. No beacon for success. A\nseries of fundamental issues are not resolved, including: Modernism, role of private\nsector, role of foreigners. Demographics create pressure on solutions because they\nneed to address distribution of wealth. Administration’s early contacts w Muslim\nBro (Muslim Brotherhood) are encouraging. They come from mercantile class.\nNeed to work with them. What to do?\nAdmin has a 4 pillar policy towards Egypt.\n1. Stabilization. We must, must, must avoid financial crisis. Give financial\nsupport (IMF, access to credit markets etc.)\n2. Job creation. Expand mandate of EBRD.\n3. Broaden participation in governance. Anti corruption laws and asset recovery\nprograms.\n4. Integration. Trade and investment. Trade liberal ization. Good regulatory\npractices (like Dodd Frank?)\nProblem in Egypt is that there is no one to talk to.\n\nBob Zoellick (just retired as President of World Bank)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025802",
