  "text": "every aspect of the killings — including any failings by the army, the Shin Bet,\nthe police or other authorities that might have allowed the tragedy to happen.\nThe commission interviewed dozens of witnesses, Israeli and Palestinian, in 31\nseparate sessions. I knew early on that the inquiry would throw up difficult\nissues. I was especially upset to learn that two soldiers and three border guards\nscheduled for guard duty at the mosque had shown up late on the morning of the\nkillings. By the time I testified in late March, the inquiry had heard from a range\nof senior and local commanders and individual soldiers. A picture had emerged\nof a series of security breakdowns, equipment malfunctions, oversights and\nconfusion around the site where the murders took place.\n\nI did not try to dodge the fact that security lapses around the Cave of the\nPatriarchs that day had contributed to what happened. In addition to the fact that\nthe guard unit was not at full strength until after the murders took place, several\nof the security cameras weren’t working. I acknowledged that if the cameras\nand the guards had done their job, at the very least some lives might be have\nsaved. Yet I also made the point that this specific act of mass murder was\nsomething the army could not have anticipated. I told the commissioners to\nremember that they were judging things after the fact. They knew how the\ntragedy had ended. In the context in which we were operating, the prospect of\nan Israeli settler, a reserve soldier, walking into a place of worship and\ndeliberately killing defenseless Palestinians had come as “a bolt from the blue.”\n\nThe commission’s report did not apportion blame to any of the army officers\nor commanders. But an inescapable conclusion from the testimony of the many\nwitnesses was that the way in which we’d become conditioned to viewing the\nsettlers had blinded us to the kind of crime Goldstein had committed. Even\nbefore I testified, I'd been disturbed to hear soldiers saying that even if they had\nseen him shooting a Palestinian, their orders were not to open fire on a settler,\nso they wouldn’t have intervened. When asked about this by the commission, I\nsaid it was a fundamental misunderstanding of our rules of engagement. “In no\ncase is there, nor can there be, an army order that says it is forbidden to shoot at\na settler even if he is shooting at others... A massacre is a massacre. You don’t\nneed special orders to know what to do.”\n\nYet I also knew that the soldiers’ “misunderstanding” was all too\nunderstandable. As I acknowledged to the inquiry, the army on the West Bank\nand Gaza was predisposed to see Palestinians who were carrying weapons as\npotential terrorists, especially since the outbreak of the intifada. The settlers, by\ncontrast, were assumed to be carrying arms in self-defense. One lesson I took\n\n260\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028108",
