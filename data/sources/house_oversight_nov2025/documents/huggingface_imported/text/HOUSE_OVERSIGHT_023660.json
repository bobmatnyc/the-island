  "text": "Yemen and what are your interests? How do we communicate with him ?! his logic is that the Mahdi will\ncome and he must fertile the environment for the arrival of the Mahdi and they must control the Muslim\nworld. They deprive their people for more than thirty years of development and put him in the stage of\nhunger and poor infrastructure to achieve this goal, they will not change their mind on the day and\nnight. Otherwise, their legislation will end within Iran. What are the points of convergence that can be\ndiscussed with this system! They are almost nonexistent. This system has been tested at more than one\nstage, in the time of Rafsanjani and it turned out to be just plays. After the Khomeini revolution, the\nstrategy of expansion came to anger the world and then the leader of the peace who was Rafsanjani\nuntil he gained the confidence of the world, including us, he gained our confidence. After reaching\nanother stage and a good environment, an extremist leader is sent to continue the process of expansion,\nsuch as what we saw with Ahmadinejad in Iraq, Syria and other locations. Then another leader comes to\npreserve the gains to satisfy the world. And then an extremist commander comes in order to continue\nthe deployment of expansion, this will not happen, this is over. The believer is not bitten twice from a\nhole. We have been bitten once, and we will not be bitten again. And we know that we are the main\ngoal of the Iranian regime, to access to the Muslim Qibla is the major goal of the Iranian regime. We will\nnever wait until the battle occurs in Saudi Arabia, but we will work to have the battle in Iran rather than\nin Saudi Arabia.\n\n* What do you think of the solution in Syria, how do you see?\n\n- Syria is undoubtedly a very complex situation, no doubt that former US President Barack Obama\nmissed a lot of important opportunities that could have made a big change in Syria. Today, Syria has\nbecome an international issue. Russia is present there and it is a superpower and a big country. The\nUnited States of America exists and all five major countries are there. Any friction that may occurs\nbetween these big powers could cause a crisis which is much bigger than the Middle East crisis, the\nsituation is very complex. Today we are trying to make the most gains for the interests of Saudi Arabia,\nthe interests of the Syrian people and the countries of the region.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023660",
