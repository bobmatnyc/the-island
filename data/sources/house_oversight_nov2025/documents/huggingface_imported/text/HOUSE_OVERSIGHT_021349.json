  "text": "As the classic American example\nof fire-and-brimstone Protestant\npreaching, “Sinners in the Hands of an\nAngry God” depends, for its effect, on\nanthropomorphism: ascribing human\nform and attributes—hands, emotions,\nand purposive agency—to nonhuman\nphenomena. Anthropomorphism has\nbeen a hotly debated feature of religion\nsince classical antiquity. But, in the\nmodern world, religious\nanthropomorphism has become\nespecially controversial, while, at the\nsame time, also becoming a crucial\nconcept in modern theories about the\nvery nature of religion.” Modern\nobjections to anthropomorphism have\ntaken two major forms. First, traditions\nwithin Judaism, Christianity, and Islam\nhave long opposed the worship of\n“idols,” and regarded anthropomorphism\nas a dangerous assault against genuine\npiety and properly theological\nunderstanding of existence. In the\nmodern period these religious objections\nagainst anthropomorphism have\neventuated not only in sophisticated\nintellectual polemics against\nanthropomorphic concepts of God but\nalso in popular movements of\niconoclasm, which protested against\nanthropomorphic representations of the\ndivine and sometimes physically\ndestroyed anthropomorphic images.\nSecond, the rise and development of\nmodern science has emphasized the\nregularity of the processes that structure\nthe natural world. And even when these\norderly processes were described as\nnatural “laws”—a term with obvious\nanthropomorphic connotations—they\nhave generally been understood in ways\nthat are thoroughly impersonal and\nlacking any intrinsic purpose or design.\nHence, modern science has generated\nnumerous questions about religious\n\n103\n\nPage\n\ninterpretations of influence on the course\nof nature by divine ideas and purposes.\nSince the late nineteenth century, many\ninstances of the so-called “warfare”\nbetween science and theology have\nturned on the issue of whether any\nscientific plausibility could be attached\nto concepts of a divine mind, purpose, or\nintention that guided or ordered the\nstructure of the universe.\" According to\nthe philosopher Charles Taylor, the\ntransition from perceptions of a divinely\nordered, purposive universe to an\n“impersonal order” of nature marked a\npivotal change that, especially since the\neighteenth century, has shaped “a secular\nage” among the societies of the modern\nWest.” In short, anthropomorphism has\nnot only become a source of tension\nwithin religions but also something of an\nimpasse between religious and scientific\ninterpretations of the universe.\nNonetheless, anthropomorphic\nassumptions remain vigorously present\nin many of the modern forms of\ntheology, spiritual practice, and religious\nart, a persistence that suggests the\nstrength of the psychological and social\nfunctions performed by\nanthropomorphic representation.\n\nIn light of these longstanding\ncontroversies about religious\nanthropomorphism, the graphically\nanthropomorphic, spider-dangling deity\nof Edwards’s sermon would seem to\noffer a good test case for understanding\nhow anthropomorphic religious language\nworks in the modern era. Such an\nunderstanding begins with one of the\ncentral themes of this book, namely, the\npowerful human motivation to establish\nand maintain social connections.\nAnthropomorphism extends this drive\nfor social connection beyond the\nboundaries of human societies by\nattributing human characteristics to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021349",
