We are doing everything in our power to back it.\nSPIEGEL: The Americans have threatened tough consequences...\n\nElaraby: That's an unacceptable position for us! The strongest and\nrichest country in the world is incapable of making a commitment.\nInstead, someone from Tel Aviv or Jerusalem is telling them what to\ndo.\n\nSPIEGEL: Won't this stance lead to tensions between the Arab\nLeague and the United States?\n\nElaraby: I hope it doesn't come to that. If the Americans had fulfilled\nthe promises they made many years ago and had forced the Israelis to\nengage in serious negotiations, the problem would have been solved\nalready.\n\nSPIEGEL: The German government has also announced that it will\nnot support the Palestinians’ plan.\n\nElaraby: I heard what (German Chancellor) Angela Merkel said. She\ncited the Germans' unique responsibility to the Jews. But the\nGermans also have a responsibility to the Palestinians.\n\nSPIEGEL: The radical Islamic group Hamas, which controls the\nGaza Strip, also doesn't recognize Israel.\n\nElaraby: Has Israel recognized Hamas? That sort of thing is based\non reciprocity.\n\nSPIEGEL: But the Islamists in the Gaza Strip are the ones firing\nrockets at Israeli cities.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025014",
