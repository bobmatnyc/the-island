In 2005, he\nand the agency were jointly awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for their\nnonproliferation endeavors. Doubtless the Norwegian selectors,\nalways ready to needle American hawks, also sought to reward his\nbold critique of the American-led war against Iraq, especially since\nthey drew ill-tempered ripostes from top officials in the Bush\nadministration, particularly “Dick Cheney and his faction.”\n\nIn many ways, this David-Goliath confrontation over Iraq both drove\nE|Baradei in his years atop the I.A.E.A. and also inspired this\nmemoir. The Iraq story is well known. The Bush team insisted that\nSaddam Hussein — who had cheated on nukes and chemical\nweapons once before and been caught — had or was on the verge of\nacquiring nuclear weapons, and they demanded I.A.E.A. inspections\nof Iraq to confirm it. The agency conducted 247 inspections at 147\nsites in Iraq from November 2002 until March 2003 and found no\nviolations and no nuclear weapons. Nonetheless, the United States\ninsisted on its own “evidence” and went to war. There can be no\nexaggerating the negative effects of this experience on world opinion\ntoward the United States and upon ElBaradei himself as I.A.E.A.\nchief.\n\nE|Baradei’s self-proclaimed mission became preventing another Iraq-\ntype war. To this end, he significantly upgraded the agency’s\ninspection capabilities, building on the work of his predecessor, Hans\nBlix. At the same time, ElBaradei decried American\ncounterproliferation efforts as warmongering. These campaigns\nprovided the three themes of his memoir: the need to strengthen the\nmandate and standing of the I.A.E.A., to restrain sword-waving by\nthe great powers (read the United States), and to emphasize\ndiplomacy and collective security instead.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024971",
