  "text": "IT, still desperately needed- reporting flawed cumbersome and inaccurate . all done by hand as one -off\nexercises , - airplane: re structure, (my only suggested priority in june ) is really ,no further ahead, ,consultants\nup the kazoo but nothing at all done.( the office was told that i cannot even see the proposals received without\nbrads specific authorization ) - brad has no idea even as to what questions to ask. he knows little of finance, is\nrun roughshod over by almost everyone in the office. he is a little man , using your power, to appear larger .\nEileen was self aware enough to know she was over her head , that is a huge difference. bad info is\nrampant ie 3 million in deductions Im told are taken for art space but on closer examination it turns out\nthey cannot be used at all. (ZERO benefit ) though you will be told yes they were deducted on the return they\nsaid that is the question they get asked ! \" were they deducted \"not -\"is there a benefit\" !! I asked for the\nbalance sheet and P and L for Regan arts , a basic first step in order to check your financials. \"sorry we never\ngot one?\" though 9.8 million invested, no p&l, nothing , a construction project run amok , no budget, the coo\nfired after only 3 months. , no clue. I can add that artspace financials are also a total mess.\n\nAs your friend and in order toturn the page. I will try to be constructive\nThe following is alist of things I think would be in your interest to get done asap .but definitely not by me.\n\nisuggest you form new grats. , hire a high level tax partner. use your trading accounts as they remain\n\nthe paramount requirement 16 months after i emailed to you their importance. , I suggest you\n\nconsider having the 49percent of phaidon merged into artspance and have Richard buy artspace. re-do bank\nloans. no need to pay interest at higher rates on boat or plane. . as Richard is now no longer trustee. re- do\nwill, make suydam executor , with Barry, and john as back up. pay 1 million a year for executor role. get rid\nof Judy Black trust, deal with gifts and their tax returns, . review amounts to kids at fixed ages. put more\nprotections in for Alex and Victoria. , distribute some money to kids let them make decisions. , decide art\ndivision with children in attendance . have fire drill done on estate. fill out estate returns as if you and Debra\ndied today, choose advisers - rick bronstein said the only 1040 he ever filled out was his own. ( this is brads\nchosen advisor??!) Halperin has a conflict that should be addressed., Debra should enter a tenants in common\nagreement with kids. you have airplane consultants tax consultants it consultants. plane operation consultant.\n. boat consultants. architects, lighting , art, legal, . foundation , deal with TRA , BRH, rationalize\ninvestments. cash flow. reporting, gaming disclosures. foreign, gift. . prepare tax projections for 15 and 16, .\ndeal with neg basis ( tufts gain, debt financed. art partnership, pledges. sell stock , art, deal with phaidon\n\ndebt. athene,? income, capital , foreign , exit, corporate, insurance regs, out and inbound\n\nissues, basis, appropriate discount rates. ? terminations. control. , qualified dividends. corporate\n\ntolls, inversion rules. , grat issues, short swing and other sec disclosures, Rothshcild bank, 150b they have a\ndistribution network with no products , private bank Rockefeller Rothschild. financial service. deal with UK\nvisa issue sooner rather than later. we can talk about Rowen request re Athene , 2 billion in taxes on\ntransaction. ?!\n\nthe facts as i see them\n\nin June and then again Sept, we both agreed to a 50% of phaidon payout., then after weeks of thinking about\nthe issue ( which I fully understand ) . the payout was unilaterally changed . Sm woudl be reserved for the\nfuture ? . and out of the remaining 15m ,? i would receive only 5. ( note : I'm confident that both the debt , and\nthe artspace investment will also lead to a write off of another 30 m. plus ) In my dining room ,you were\nsurprised when I said that i require most people to pay their advisory fee up front so that I am assured that I\nwill be properly compensated for my work when strategies that I devise are implemented . you may recall that\nyou appeared offended and said \" are you suggesting that i would go back on my word \" I said no , of course\nnot ! you are my closest of friends ,but my experience is that when amounts get large, people tend to get\nunhappy when it actually comes time for them to pay ,.\nFrom day zero a 50 - 60 million price was attached as the fair price of the transaction just completed .\nthough this amount was already substantially less thanour agreed and negotiated formula. - I was\nnever told that this was out of range. in fact, alternative methods of payment. plane -in-kind etc, were\ndiscussed (ie keeping the 30m portion of fee outstanding till March ) ,J provided as requested a\ndetailed step by step execution plan and reviewed all documents that 1 was given access to.
