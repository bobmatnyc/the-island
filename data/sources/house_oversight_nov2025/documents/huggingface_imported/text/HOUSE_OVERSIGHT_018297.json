  "text": "showed how groups could suck power into themselves from networks, along\ninvisible lines, and animate themselves as if by connection to electricity. The\nprotesters and terrorists understood power that existed simply because of\nconnectivity. They understood how easy it was to connect. And so they had an\ninstinct that eluded the comfortable men in the palaces. The usual reaction of\nauthorities - Round up the usual suspects - didn’t work because, as Castells noted,\n“The usual suspects were networks.” You couldn’t arrest a network.\n\n3\n\nBefore we can go much further in figuring out how network power might be used -\nto close up those six worrisome paradoxes, to create massive new companies (or\ninvest in them), to rebuild our politics —- ] think we need a picture of sorts in our\nheads of this new landscape. What does a network look like? How does it’s design\naffect its operation? Yes, it’s true you can’t arrest a network. But can you say\nsomething about howit’s different? Can you spot the parts that are dangerous?\nWhen someone like Castells says to us, “Power is moving,” what does that mean\nexactly? Where is it going? What I want to do now is begin to assemble an image of a\nnetwork, and to show what that sort of linked design tells us about where we are\nnow and where we're going. Then, with such a picture, firmly in our minds, we can\nask just what these networks are for, after all, and how they might be used.\n\nIt is an old chestnut of historians and anthropologists that power - the ability to\nmake or cause things to happen - is often determined by structure. When | say,\n“Superpower” | am painting a picture of the international system with a single word.\n“Highway,” does the same - and tells you something about logistics, trucks,\neconomic power. Or “City.” This is why “org charts” have such a decisive power.\nThink of the map of power in your family or your office or a nation. Who makes the\ndecisions? Why? The way we bottle up our lives in firms or congresses or\nuniversities flavors just about every other decision we make®®. An imperial CEO,\nprone to visions and control creates a different sort of firm than a boss who moves\namong his employees nearly as an equal. An army that moves from the top down is\ndifferent than one that lives, as Mao said of the Chinese guerilla forces that mastered\nthe country against steep odds in 1949, “as if they were fish and the people were\nwater.” Power is always packed into structures of some sort. Emperors, kings,\npresidents and congresses all reflect certain arrangements. But those arrangements\nchange; power moves. You can see leaders struggle with this constant shifting:\nThink of the “Englightened Despotism” of the 18 Century as Frederick II of Prussia,\nJoseph II of the Hapsburgs and Catherine IJ in St. Petersburg each struggled to marry\nthe then-new ideas of liberty with older instincts of control. History is, in one sense,\nnothing but the tale of the movement of power. Once the idea of an Assyrian king\nemperor was new, as was the notion of a President or a Pope. History is paced by\nthe arrival of new species of all sorts; and by the death of others. This is as true for\ninstitutions as is it for bugs. With this caveat: No one gives up power easily.\n\n88 The way we: See Venkatesh Rao, “The Amazing, Shrinking Org Chart”, on\nRibbonfarm.com, May 28, 2015\n\n65\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018297",
