From each brand/retailer, we have assumed to earn a revenue of\n$25,000 to $30,000 per year. Additional revenue will be received through providing\nconsulting services to clients, especially government sectors and political parties.\n\nIn our first three years, we are projecting $400,000 in Year 1, $850,000 in Year 2 and\n$1.6 million in Year 3 in revenue with a 100% profit margin. We expect PR and\nMarketing to be our top expense. The first 2 years’ payroll costs will be minimal as\nfounding members are not taking any salary for that period of time.\n\n| Page 13 |\n\nCONFIDENTIAL - DO NOT DISSEMINATE.
