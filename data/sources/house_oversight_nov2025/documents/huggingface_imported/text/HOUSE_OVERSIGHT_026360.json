The five core developers are like Linus Torvalds of Linux. They decide what \nchanges are made to the core code. One of the five is the lead developer, Wladimir, and one is the Chief \nScientist, Gavin. \n> Gavin, Wladimir and Cory (an important contributing developer) were being paid out of a non-profit \norganization called the Bitcoin Foundation. A few weeks ago, it \"blew up\" when one of the board members \ndeclared the foundation \"bankrupt\". ( https://bitcoinfoundation.org/forum/index.php?/topic/1284-the-truth-\nabout-the-bitcoin-foundation/ ) Many organizations scrambled to step into the vacuum created by the \nfoundation and \"take control\" of the developers. We moved quickly talking to all of the various stakeholders \nand the three developers decided to join the Media Lab. This is a big win for us. \n> According to the WSJ Blog: \n> http://blogs.wsj .com/moneyb eat/2015/04/24/bitb eat-tackling-bitcoin-pric e-swings-with-eye-on-emerging-\nmarkets/  \n>> It's official, more or less: MIT's famed Media Lab has become the principal home and funding source for \nthe small team of developers responsible for maintaining and improving bitcoin's core software. \n>> \n>> Gavin Andresen, who bears the title of Chief Scientist for the six-person core development team, \nannounced on his blog Wednesday that he and two other core developers, Wladimir van der Laan and Cory \nFields, had moved to the MIT Media Lab's new Digital Currency Initiative, ending their previous status as \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 026360 \nemployees of the Bitcoin Foundation. The three other core developers, who draw salaries from different \nemployers, will continue in that status. \n> \n> The usually rather feisty community has been overall very supportive and I think it is because of our strong \nresearch focus and our neutral position. \n> \n> The initiative has strong support from faculty across campus including crypto guru Ron Rivest and former \nChief Economist of the IMF, Simon Johnson as well as faculty at the Media Lab, Sandy Pentland and Andy \nLippman. \n> \n> More about initiative here: \n> \n> http://joi.ito.com/weblog/2015/04/15/announcing-mit-dci.html  \n> https://medium.com/@medialab/launching-a-digital-currency-initiative-238fc678aba2  \n> \n> I hired one of Megan's former colleagues from the White House, Brian Forde who was in charge of figuring \nout Bitcoin at the White House and brief the POTUS on Bitcoin to run the initiative and he is doing an \namazing job so far. \n> \n> https://newsoffice.mit. edu/2015/brian-forde-media-lab-director-digital-currency-0415  \n> \n> Fred and Reid on the Advisory Council have been super helpful in helping us navigate this. Advisory \nCouncil member Jim Pallotta is also active in this space and joined our first and very successful dinner with \nMedia Lab Member (sponsor) companies to kick off a special interest group for our companies. \n> \n> I am in discussions with Stanford, Princeton and Hong Kong UST to create an academic network for \nresearch. We are also participating in a policy network with Stanford, Harvard and Oxford. \n> \n> Happy to follow with more information for anyone interested in learning more or getting involved. \n> \n> - Joi \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
