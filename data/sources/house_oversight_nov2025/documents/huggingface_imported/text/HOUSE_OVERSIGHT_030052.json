  "text": "23\n\nhis father murdered at least 10,000 — and start thinking\nHammersmith.\n\nQuestions swirl. Who are the Libyan rebels? Who are the angry of\nLatakia? The Arab transitions will be long and bumpy — like those\nthat brought representative government to Latin America and Central\nEurope and wide swathes of Asia — but now that fear has been\novercome, they are irreversible.\n\nHere’s who the protesters are: people like Asmaa Mahfouz, 26, the\nEgyptian woman who on Jan. 18 made a video urging citizens to go\nto Tahrir Square on Jan. 25 — the demonstration that would start the\nrevolution. She said then: “We’ll go down and demand our rights,\nour fundamental human rights. I won’t even talk about any political\nrights. We just want our human rights and nothing else.” And she\nsaid people “don’t have to come to Tahrir Square, just go down\nanywhere and say it, that we are free human beings.” And: “This is\nenough!”\n\nPeople are being born throughout the Middle East. They are\ndiscovering their capacity to change things, their inner “Basta!”\nThat’s how the Arab spring began on Dec. 17 in the little town of\nSidi Bouzid in Tunisia — with a fruit peddler’s “enough” to\nhumiliation. In my end is my beginning.\n\nThree months later the genie is not only out of the bottle, it’s\nshattered the bottle. I said of Libya in an earlier column: Be ruthless\nor stay out. So now the West is in, be ruthless. Arm the resurgent\nrebels. Incapacitate Qaddafi. Do everything short of putting troops on\nthe ground. Qaddafi, as President Obama has said, “must leave.” So\nthat Libya can be an Arab country that is imperfect but open.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030052",
