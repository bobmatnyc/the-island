And it’s a little\nhard to picture how he might ever be seen as such—that is to say,\neven if he’s reelected, he’ll probably have a Republican House or\nSenate (or both) that will thwart him at every turn, so the best he’Il be\nable to say is that he presided over a slow and very difficult economic\nrecovery, which presumably will finally happen by January 2017.

Yes, of course, let’s stipulate: the war isn’t actually, you\nknow, over. And even after it is, Libya could descend into chaos or\nextremism or both (although it is heartening to read that the National\nTransitional Council, the recognized new governing body, apparently\nhas detailed governance plans in place).

The administration’s statement in June that the\nconflict wasn’t under the purview of the War Powers Act because\nbombing didn’t constitute “hostilities” was ridiculous. And many\ncritics reasonably felt back in March that Obama was a little slow to\npull the trigger on the intervention (I didn’t share that view).\n\nAll that said, the administration has already handled a lot of these\nchanges well (and in the face of absolutely constant know-it-all\ncriticism). One of the best things an American administration can do\nwhen big changes are afoot somewhere in the world is stay out of the\nway and not act as if we can will an outcome just because we’re\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031914",
