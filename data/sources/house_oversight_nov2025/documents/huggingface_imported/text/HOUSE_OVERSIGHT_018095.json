Zawahiri has experience in rebuilding broken terrorist\ngroups; his own organization in Egypt, Al Jihad, was twice wiped out\nby operational errors, and Zawahiri had to rally the demoralized\nsurvivors, even pretending to step aside from power, although he was\nnever really far from the controls. His ultimate solution was to merge\nAl Jihad with Al Qaeda, making it into an Egyptian body with a\nSaudi head. Now that bin Laden is gone, the challenge for Zawahiri\nwill be to keep non-Egyptians in Al Qaeda.
