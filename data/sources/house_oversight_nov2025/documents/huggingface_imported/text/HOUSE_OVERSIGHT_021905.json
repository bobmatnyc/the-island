These\nwere flight logs that were produced by Mr. Dershowitz to\nthe Palm Beach Police Department.\n\nWhen you wonder why did they stop in\nSeptember, you Know, why stop in September 2005? What's\nthe significance of that? Well, later on, additional\nflight logs were obtained, and sure enough, who shows up\non an October 2005 flight log with Jeffrey Epstein?\n\nMr. Dershowitz.\n\nSo that led to a suspicion that\nMr. Dershowitz had provided to the Palm Beach Police\nDepartment flight logs that, the time period of which\nfor the production had been carefully crafted to keep\nhim out of it; in other words, to not produce the\nOctober 2005 version.\n\nThe other thing I began to discover is, I\nstarted going through some flight logs. Dave Rogers,\nwho is one of I think about three pilots that Epstein\nregularly relied on to fly his -- he had very fancy --\nto use the technical term -- jets. There were about\n\nthree pilots there.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021905",
