He has served as the\nChair of the Psychology Department since 1997.\nHe has served as the editor for the International\nJournal of Speech Technology and 1s on the\neditorial board of Brain & Language, and has\nedited several books on spoken language\nprocessing. His research interests include\nspoken language use, mechanisms of learning\nand attention, and the role of sleep in learning.\nHis recent research has investigated the social\nuse of language and the evolution of language.\nIn addition, he has been working on neural\nmechanisms of reward and economic decisions.\n\nWe often think about language in terms\nof the information in newspapers or speeches or\nreports. However, language 1s basis of all our\nsocial relationships and institutions. We reward\nand praise with language and we shun and\npunish with language, perhaps more often than\nwith any other medium. In the recent election,\nDemocratic candidates actually gave speeches\noutlining different views of the importance of\nlanguage in our society. One candidate held that\nwords are simply words and only have the force\nthat we give to them by reasoning about them.\nThe other candidate argued that speech has the\npower to move people to connect and act.\nNusbaum was struck by this debate because it\nseems to him that the power of language goes\nwell beyond what linguists and psychologists\ntalk about as “meaning” and that understanding\nthe meaning of language may depend on\nunderstanding the social and emotional impact of\nlanguage. In this chapter, the idea of the impact\nof language at a distance is explored.\n\nPage | 66\n\nLanguage is one of the most\nimportant ways in which the social brain\nmakes connections, enhances\nconnections, and severs connections\namong people. Language is our primary\nmedium of social exchange, grounding\nand elaborating our selves and our\nrelationships in every conversation.\nHowever, language goes well beyond\npersonal connections to connect us\nculturally through stories, songs, and\nshared manners of speech. Language\nalso provides the formal framework that\ndefines many of our social institutions.\nLanguage gives form and substance to\nthe governance and behavior of every\nsocial institution from education to law\nto religion. Clearly there are many ways\nin which language serves to knit us\ntogether both formally and informally.\nFor a linguist, all of these uses can be\nanalyzed in terms of the structure of\nsentences and their content. However,\nstructure and content do not, on their\nown merits, provide a complete picture\nof how language can have the impact it\ndoes on our sense of social connection.\nHow does language move us to act,\nchange our feelings, and connect us to\nothers? It seems unlikely that the impact\nof language is simply the result of\ndispassionate rational inferences and\nconclusions drawn from a logical\nanalysis of sentences.\n\nIn 1976, Barbara Jordan, a\nCongresswoman from Texas, gave the\ncommencement address at Brandeis\nUniversity. Listening to her speak about\nthe importance of public service and the\nimportance of using talent and ability in\nservice of one’s country was an\nimpressive experience. Her delivery was\nclear and not particularly dramatic and\nyet the force of her speech was riveting.\nIt was sufficient to turn a graduating\nsenior’s mind from graduate school in\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021312",
