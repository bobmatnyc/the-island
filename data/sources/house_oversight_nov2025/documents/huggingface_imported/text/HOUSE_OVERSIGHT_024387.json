  "text": "The Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the government, in\nthe legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university programs that distribute\npropaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout textbooks for even younger\nstudents. It includes control over most of the nation’s mosques and local Imams guiding the mess ages engaged\nMuslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR, ISNA, MSA and others associated\nand/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly interested in “outreach” which know\nhow to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western Civilization. They have fooled a large part of\nour authorities and media due in part to their patience and willingness to chip away, one airport prayer room,\none frivolous intimidating lawsuit, one Congressman or CIA officer, one mosque, one ruling at a time.\n\nParticularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as cultural and psychological tendencies\ntoward diversity, Western guilt and expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and difficult to uproot.\nThe Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public which is completely at odds with their true\nagenda and how they deal in private. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve Emerson, Frank Gaffney,\nAndy McCarthy and others have done s o much to uncover this level of Jihad that your readers should be urged\nto review as much of their work (including Steve’s recent excellent documentary, The Grand Deception, and\nFrank’s important web video course, The Muslim Brotherhood in America) as possible.\n\nFinally, there is a third level — the International Institutional Jihad. Here the most powerful international\ninstitutions such as the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others seek to push into America\nfrom without those changes which are difficult to complete from within. The OIC is the largest Islamic\ninstitution in the world. It essentially controls the vote in the UN’s General Assembly and thus explains in part\nthe absurd and abject pro-Islamic, anti-Israel thrust of that organizat ion. This level seeks to use the power of\nIslamic nations to work fro m outside the West to force changes within the West. While there are various\nconflicts between many of the nations, being Islamic majority states, there is a great deal they agree upon which\nbecomes the focus of these efforts. Just as the Obama administration is beginning to cooperate with\ninternational efforts to control gun ownership, so has Hillary Clinton’s Istanbul Process become a dangerous\nstep in the effort to restrict speech critical of Islam by norm (or possibly even treaty) when it may not be fully\nexecutable by domestic action alone.\n\nI should point out that Stephen Coughlin, the former Pentagon officer who has an important must-see\npresentation of Islamic Law, uses different names for these same three levels — Jihad, Dawa, and Ummah. Had I\nseen his work before I wrote my book I would have conformed to his categorizations.\n\nWe must learn how powerful language has become on all three levels. Words such as “peace, $B!I\n“freedom,” ”terrorism,” and phrases such as “human rights” have different meanings for us and for our Islamic\nEnemy. To oversimplify, “peace” is not something for now but that which comes when all the earth is\nsubmitting to Islam. In the context of battles, “peace” is at best a temporary ceasefire. “Freedom” is best\nunderstood as having the freedom to fully submit to Islam, not to choose whatever beliefs one desires while\nrespecting the same right in others. We’ve all seen how “human rights” and “terror” really only apply among\nMuslims, not to non-Muslims. Our enemy fully understands these differences and uses them at all levels to\nparalyze us.\n\nLook simply at how the phrase “TIsraeli-Palestinian conflict” has equalized the two parties, making it all the\neasier to ascribe features of one to the other and view the problem as a simple-to fix division of ass ets into\nstatehoods but for personality problems among the leaders. The simple truth is that this is and has always been a\none-sided Arab war against Israel as Ruth Wisse and others have described and, as Bibi Netanyahu made clear,\nthe ONLY state truly at issue here has been the State of Israel that the Arabs have refused for over half a\ncentury. Nonetheless, the Control Factor hypnotically abuses the mind’s susceptibility to the intricacies of\nlanguage.\n\nEven the label “Peace Process” has been damaging language. While most focus upon the first word, turning this\ninto a “process” has helped ensure that peace is never obtained. It is more appropriately called the “Extortion\nProcess” because all that results is that violence is used over decades to extract concessions from Israel.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024387",
