  "text": "Trump or those around him. Priebus himself could, not too helpfully, argue only that no\none had any idea how much worse all this would have been without his long-suffering\nmediation among the president’s relatives, his Svengali, and Trump’s own terrible\ninstincts. There might be two or three debacles a day, but without Priebus’s stoic resolve,\nand the Trump blows that he absorbed, there might have been a dozen more.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nOn June 8, from a little after ten in the morning to nearly one in the afternoon, James\nComey testified in public before the Senate Intelligence Committee. The former FBI\ndirector’s testimony, quite a tour de force of directness, moral standing, personal honor,\nand damning details, left the country with a simple message: the president was likely a\nfool and certainly a liar. In the age of modern media politesse, few presidents had been so\ndirectly challenged and impugned before Congress.\n\nHere it was, stark in Comey’s telling: the president regarded the FBI director as\nworking directly for him, of owing his job to him, and now he wanted something back.\n“My common sense,” said Comey, “again, I could be wrong, but my common sense told\nme what’s going on here is he’s looking to get something in exchange for granting my\nrequest to stay in the job.”\n\nIn Comey’s telling, the president wanted the FBI to lay off Michael Flynn. And he\nwanted to stop the FBI from pursuing its Russia-related investigation. The point could\nhardly have been clearer: if the president was pressuring the director because he feared\nthat an investigation of Michael Flynn would damage him, then this was an obstruction of\nJustice.\n\nThe contrast between the two men, Comey and Trump, was in essence the contrast\nbetween good government and Trump himself. Comey came across as precise,\ncompartmentalized, scrupulous in his presentation of the details of what transpired and the\nnature of his responsibility—he was as by-the-book as it gets. Trump, in the portrait\noffered by Comey, was shady, shoot-from-the-hip, heedless or even unaware of the rules,\ndeceptive, and in it for himself.\n\nAfter the hearing ended, the president told everybody he had not watched it, but\neverybody knew he had. To the extent that this was, as Trump saw it, a contest between\nthe two men, it was as direct a juxtaposition as might be imagined. The entire point of the\nComey testimony was to recast and contradict what the president had said in his angry and\ndefensive tweets and statements, and to cast suspicion on his actions and motives—and to\nsuggest that the president’s intention was to suborn the director of the FBI.\n\nEven among Trump loyalists who believed, as Trump did, that Comey was a phony and\nthis was all a put-up job, the nearly universal feeling was that in this mortal game, Trump\nwas quite defenseless.\n\n7 OK Ok\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020068",
