  "text": "A decade later, the idea would suddenly resurface. In my first meeting, as a\nnewly promoted Major General, with our then Defence Minister Ariel Sharon,\nSharon turned to me and the army’s Chief of Staff, Rafael Eitan, and said: “Tell\nme. Why the hell is Arafat still alive?” He looked first at Raful, then at me, and\nadded: “When I was 20 years younger than you are, I never waited for someone\nlike Ben-Gurion or Dayan to ask me to plan an operation. I would plan it! Then\nI’d take it to them and say, you’re the politicians, you decide, but if you say yes,\nwe'll do it.” I smiled, telling him that I’d done exactly that, a decade earlier,\nonly to have one of his mates in the top brass say no. Sharon now said yes. But\nthe plan was overtaken: by his ill-fated plan to launch a full-scale invasion of\nLebanon in 1982, targeting not just Arafat, but with the aim of crushing the\nPLO militarily once and for all.\n\nI finally met Arafat face-to-face at the end of 1995. Although the Oslo peace\nprocess had dramatically changed things, it was clear that the real prize — real\npeace — was still far away. We were in Barcelona, for a Euro-Mediterranean\nmeeting under the auspices of King Juan Carlos, aimed at trying to re-invigorate\nnegotiations. The ceremonial centrepiece of the event was a dinner at one of the\nroyal palaces, and it was arranged for me and Arafat to meet for a few minutes\nbeforehand. | arrived first. I found myself in a breathtakingly opulent, but\notherwise empty, room. Empty, that is, except for a dark-brown Steinway piano.\nFrom childhood, I have loved music. And while I am never likely to threaten the\ncareer of anyone in the New York Philharmonic, I have, over the years,\ndeveloped some ability, and drawn huge enjoyment, as a classical pianist. I\npulled back the red-velvet bench and began to play. With my back to the\ndoorway, I was unaware that Arafat had arrived, and that he was soon standing\nonly a few feet away, watching as I played one of my favourite pieces, a Chopin\nwaltz. My old commando antennae must have been blunted. I may not have\nbecome “fat”. But, undeniably, I was now a politician.\n\nWhen I finally realised Arafat was behind me, I turned, embarrassed, stood\nup, and grasped his hand. “It’s a real pleasure to meet you,” I said. “I must say I\nhave spent many years watching you — by other means.” He smiled. We stood\ntalking for about 10 minutes. My hope was to establish simple, human contact;\nto signal respect; to begin to create the conditions not to try to kill Arafat, but to\nmake peace with him. “We carry a great responsibility,” I said. “Both of our\npeoples have paid a heavy price, and the time has come to find a way to solve\nthis.”\n\n7\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027855",
