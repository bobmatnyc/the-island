I’m in shock that it flourishes in the most visible,\nglaring spotlight of our culture, the part that worhips and presents our current idea of beauty in\nalmost everything we touch.\n\nThese victims are on the most prominent slave block ever, emulated by our children, coveted by\nour culture-makers and our society, and standing in the brightest global spotlight in the\n\nworld.

According to media\nreports, Diane Sawyer produced a segment for CBS's 60 Minutes featuring a sex scandal that\neventually led Eileen Ford (founder of renowned Ford modeling agency) to stop working with\nBrunel.\n\nBrunel's latest venture is the modeling agency MC2 based in South Beach, Fla. with satellite\noffices in New York and Tel Aviv.
