  "text": "I' m_ seventy-five. Hell, | drink at least eight glasses of water a day\nnow—just like I’ m supposed to, for my health—but then | have to pee at\nleast eight times a day. Ironically, the TV commercials warn that if you have\nto pee eight times in 24 hours, it’ s a symptom of an overactive bladder.\n\nIndeed, irony has permeated this long-running scandal, beginning\nto end. It was ironic that my sexual appetite helped put me in office—the\nGennifer Flowers allegation originally placed me in the media\nspotlight—and it was my sexual appetite that almost tossed me out of that\nsame office. And it’ s ironic that, although Kathleen Willey enjoyed our\nbrief encounter, to prove it we would have had to resort to obtaining\ntestimony from her confidant, the wonderful Linda Tripp.\n\nNow, there are things that I’ ve done as president of which I’ m\ntruly ashamed. Even before my inauguration, | made it a point to stop in\nArkansas to oversee the execution of a mentally retarded prisoner. At his\nlast meal, he said he’ d wait to have his dessert, a slice of pecan pie, until\nafter the execution—that’ s how much he understood what was going on.\nI' m ashamed of under-protecting the rights of gays and over-protecting\nchildren from the Internet. I' m ashamed of being aga/nst medical\nmarijuana and for requiring a urine test as a prerequisite to obtaining a\n\ndriver’ s license. I' m ashamed of bombing Iraq, Afghanistan and Sudan.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015140",
