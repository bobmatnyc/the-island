  "text": "peace deal are clear enough, too. But in both cases, neither side trusts the\nother, and each demands that the other go first. Instead, nobody goes\nanywhere.\n\nU.S. officials have very good reason to be wary of Iran's bona fides. In\n2009, they reached a deal with Iranian negotiators to send the stockpile of\nhighly enriched uranium out of the country -- only to see the ayatollah\nrepudiate it. As Ray Takeyh, an Iran expert with the Council on Foreign\nRelations puts it, \"Khamenei has created a politics where it's hard for him\nto compromise.\" But so has the United States. Anyone who watched\nChuck Hagel's confirmation hearing knows that it is an article of faith in\nCongress -- and pretty much a bipartisan one -- that Iran is a faithless,\nillegitimate terrorist state that will be deterred from building a bomb only\nby the threat of massive attack. Had Hagel been foolish enough to suggest\nthat the United States offer to reduce sanctions in exchange for Iranian\nconcessions, the White House would have had to find a new candidate for\ndefense secretary.\n\nIt's the U.S. Congress that arguably holds the high cards, though the White\nHouse put them in its hands. The most potent sanctions are legislated, and\nhave been written in such a way that they will be very hard to unwind.\nObama can waive them for up to six months. But the ayatollah is not about\nto make irreversible decisions in exchange for six months of relief.\n\nThe White House is thus stuck between Tehran and Capitol Hill. And it\ncan't live long with the current stalemate. After all, Obama has said that\n\"containment\" is not an option. He is hoping that the combination of\neconomic pain and fear of military action will bring Tehran to its senses. If\nit doesn't, the president has said that he is prepared to use force. Perhaps\n\nhe feels that just as spurned engagement served as the predicate for tough\nsanctions, so would failed negotiations lay the predicate for a broadly\nsupported strike against Iran's nuclear facilities. Iran left us no choice, he\nmight say, as the bombers fly.\n\nThat would constitute a diplomatic triumph ... if a strike against Iran's\nnuclear facilities is a good idea. If in fact it's a dreadful prospect -- worse,\nperhaps, even than containment -- then it would constitute a failure that\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028733",
