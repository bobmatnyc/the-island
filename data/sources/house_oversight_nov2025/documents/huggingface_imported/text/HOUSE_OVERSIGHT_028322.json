James Simpson, a partner at\nKnight Frank, says: “The interplay\nbetween luxury art and property sales has\nalways existed, but it’s only now, starting\nwith Cornwall Terrace, that we are\nformally doing launches and activities»\nthat bring together the two.”\n\nBeth Dean, the sales and marketing\ndirector at Oakmayne, agrees: “Even at\nthis top end of the property market, sales\nneed to be ‘worked’ [tis no longer\nenough to do a basic stand-alone launch\nwith a residential product. You need to.do\nsomething unique, stylish and very\n® special to differentiate your brand.”\n\nSimpson says that there are more\nDamien Hirst works in the residences\nsurrounding Regent's Park than in any\nother London location: “The marriage of t\nthe classic Regency properties and }\ncontemporary art works really well.”\ncornwallterrace.co.uk, knightfrank.\nco.uk, christiesgreatestates.com\n\n.\n\nIt is no longer\nenough to do\na stand-alone\nlaunch, even\nat the top end\nof the market\n\nMain picture: The interior of a Cornwall Terrace mansion;\n\nRegent's Park, above, is just on the doorstep; and the art collector\nClaudia Schiffer, below, at this year’s Frieze art fair in London\n\nures from\n\nfest run.

Culture Label recently\nopened an online art shop, with work\nfrom.550 artists costing between £100\nand £2,000. The shop is a collaboration\nwith Own Art, an Arts Council\ninitiative, through which you can pay in\ninterest-free instalments.\n\nMeanwhile, the website easyart.com,\nwhich tailors its artworks to buyers\nwith interior decoration in mind, has\nlaunched an iPhone app that lets you\ntest 50,000 prints, in different frames,\nina picture of the room that you wish\nto decorate.\n\nNol everyone recommends buying\nonline, however, as we discovered by\nasking top interior designers for their\ntips on purchasing art for yourhome.\n\nJoanna Wood, head of the eponymous\nloxury interior design firm, firmly\nstates that buying online is never a good\nidea for original artworks. “For a series\nof prints that you have seen before,\nonline could be an option. But don't buy\nan original painting from a website\nbecause so much of it is about texture.\n\n| feel'and perspective.”\n\nWood shops for works in the streets\n\n' off Piccadilly, but also recommends\n\nthe Art London fair for affordable\n\n| pieces, as does Anita Kohn, of the\n\narchitectural firm Living in Space,\nwho also loves the Affordable Art Fair.\n“The atmosphere is buzzy, the gallerists\n\n! are friendly and no piece costs more\n\nthan £3,000,” she says. “1 used to buy\nrandomly, but now I am more focused\nand collect works on paper — Old\nMaster drawings or Impressionist\nworks, often from sale rooms.”\nKamini Ezralow, of the international\n\n: design company Intarya, recommends\n\nscouring markets and galleries when\ntravelling to pick up local art and craft\npieces: “If you see a work in a gallery\nthat you like closer to home, go back\nand ask to see more by the same artist.\nYou can then build a relationship with\nthat gallerist and use them as a regular\nsource for pieces that suit your taste and\n\n: price capacity.”\n\nKohn recommends starting with\n\n: prints and advises shopping with an\n\nopen mind “so that you don't buy\nsomething purely because it fits with\n\n: your self-imposed criteria. The vital\n: thing is to buy something that you love,\n| because you will be looking at it every\n\ningle day”.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028322",
