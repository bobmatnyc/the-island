  "text": "geometries” are not related to each other essentially, either in the mathematical or\nphysiological domain, but are often made vaguely equivalent on the basis of their\n\nlexical similarity.\n\nAn experimentally meaningful relationship between fractal statistics (hazard),\ndynamical fractals (dimension) and fractal geometries (form), has to be proven ona\ncase by case basis and not assumed from their common designation. Among the\ninformal attempts to do this have been those that involve the branching pattern of\nnerves and the associated reductions in their diameter-dependent characteristic\nconduction velocities yielding a multiplicity of “arrival times.” There is, however, a\nmore central idea common to these concatenated meanings of fractal: the\nstatistical, dynamical and geometric expressions of “scaling,” a word which is not\nmentioned in Mandelbrot’s book titles. The cluster of theories, theorems and\nmethods associated with the idea of scaling (and renormalization) have led to Nobel\nPrizes for Flory (1971), Wilson (1975) and de Gennes (1979) and the (equivalent\nmathematical) Field’s Medal for McMullen (1994). There is speculation that the last\ntwo awards were supported by the inspiration and interest given their research by\n\nMandelbrot’s intuitions and books.\n\nScaling laws take the place of (unknown causal) physical laws by indicating\nthe proportion by which observables of a system can be changed in relationship to\neach other such that some statement about them, “this varies with that,” still holds.\nIn a cross species comparison, as the average weight of a mammalian body, called\nlb, increases, the skeletal weight, called w, increases at an exponentially greater\nrate: w goes like Ib'°® where Ib'° would indicate that they grew across species at\nthe same rate. Plotting log (Ib) on the x axis and log (w) on the y axis in a log-log\nplot results in a straignt line with a slope that indicates the power law scaling\nrelationship between body weight and skeletal weight across mammals. The slope\nof the scaling exponent of 1.08 is a little over 45 = 1. In contrast, the metabolic rate,\n\n0.75\n\nr, goes like (Ib)°”, r ~ (Ib)°”°. Larger animals (relative to their weight) have lower\n\nbasal metabolic rates (Schmidt-Nielsen, 1984). We don’t completely know the chain\n\nof intervening mechanisms that relate these variables to each other but we do know\n\n225\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013725",
