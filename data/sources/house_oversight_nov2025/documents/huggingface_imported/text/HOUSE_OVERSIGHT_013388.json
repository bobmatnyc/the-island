  "text": "IV. EDWARDS IS ENTITLED TO ADVERSE INFERENCES FROM\nEPSTEIN’S INVOCATION OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT AND\nTHEREFORE TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON EPSTEIN’S CLAIM,\n\nEdwards is entitled to summary judgment on the claim against him for a second and\nentirely independent reason: Epstein’s repeated invocations of the Fifth Amendment raise\nadverse inferences against him that leave no possibility that a reasonable factfinder could reach a\nverdict in his a In ruling on a summary judgment motion, the court must fulfill a\n“paldkeeping function” and should ask whether “a reasonable trier of fact could possibly” reach\na verdict in favor of the plaintiff. Willingham v. City of Orlando, 929 So.2d 43, 48 (Fla. 5\" Dist.\nCt. App. 2006) (emphasis added). Given all of the inferences that are to be drawn against\noe no reasonable finder of fact could conclude that Epstein was somehow the victim of\nimproper civil lawsuits filed against him. Instead, a reasonable finder of fact could only find that\nEpstein was a serial molester of children who was being held accountable through legitimate\n‘suits brought by Edwards and others on behalf of the minor girls that Epstein victimized.\n\n“[I]t is well-settled that the Fifth Amendment does not forbid adverse inferences against\nparties to civil actions when they refuse to testify in response to probative evidence offered\nagainst them.” Baxter v. Palmigiano, 425 U.S. 308, 318 (1976); accord Vasquez v. State, 777\nSo.2d 1200, 1203 (Fla. App. 2001). The reason for this rule “is both logical and utilitarian. A\n_ may not trample upon the rights of others and then escape the consequences by invoking a\ncoristitutional privilege — at least not in a civil setting.” Fraser v. Security and Inv. Corp., 615\nS0.2d 841, 842 (Fla. 4\" Dist. Ct. App. 1993), And, in the proper circumstances, “’Silence is\n\noften evidence of the most persuasive character.’” Fraser v. Security and Inv. Corp., 615 So.2d\n\n19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013388",
