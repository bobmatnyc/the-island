  "text": "Page 33 of 52\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *890\n\nalternative way is via the probation officer. If there is any doubt about whether the right \"to be heard\" covers communications\nto the probation officer, the right \"to be treated with fairness\" comfortably covers such a requirement.\n\nThe proposed rule requires that the probation office affirmatively seek out the victim. It is unlikely that a probation officer\ncould properly prepare a thorough presentence report without obtaining the victim's views. Indeed, the rules already require the\nofficer to include victim information in the report. 773 Because there is no way [*891] to know in advance whether the victim\nwill have relevant information for the report, the probation officer should be required to investigate that possibility. Of course,\nnothing in the proposed rule change would require the probation officer to include irrelevant or argumentative information in\nthe report.\n\nRule 32(d)(2)(B) - Presentence Report To Contain Victim Information\nThe Proposal:\n\nRule 32(d)(2)(B) should be amended to refer directly to victims in describing the content of the presentence report and to\nconform to the style used for information about defendants as follows:\n\n(2) Additional Information. The presentence report must also contain the following information:\n\n(A) the defendant's history and characteristics, including:\n\n(i) any prior criminal record;\n\n(ii) the defendant's financial condition; and\n\n(iii) any circumstances affecting the defendant's behavior that may be helpful in imposing sentence or in correctional treatment;\n\n(B) verified information, stated in a nonargumentative style, that assesses the financial, social, psychological, and medical\nimpact on any individual against whom the offense has been committed any victim of the crime ...\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nAs discussed at the outset of this article, 734 Rule 32(d)(2)(B) typifies the victim's absence from the current federal rules by\nfailing to use the word \"victim\" in describing what information belongs in a presentence report. In addition, the rule should be\namended to conform to the style used in describing the presentence report's information about the defendant. The rule dealing\nwith the [*892] defendant's background 7° contains no requirement that information be \"verified\" or stated in a \"non-\nargumentative style.\" As a matter of even-handedness, no such requirement should be listed for victim information. Of course,\nwell-trained federal probation officers will no doubt attempt to verify all information in the presentence report and phrase all of\nthe report in a non-argumentative style. The peculiarity in the current rule is that, among the numerous subjects covered by the\nrules, the verification and non-argumentative style requirements apply to victim information alone.\n\nRule 32(e) - Prosecutor To Disclose Presentence Report to Victim\nThe Proposal:\nThe prosecutor should be required to disclose relevant parts of the presentence report to victims as follows:\n\n(ec) Disclosing the Report and Recommendation.\n\n233 See supra notes 10-13 and accompanying text (discussing Rule 32(d)(2)(B)).\n\n234 See supra notes 10-13 and accompanying text.\n\n235, Fed. R. Crim. P. 32(d)(2)(A).\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017747",
