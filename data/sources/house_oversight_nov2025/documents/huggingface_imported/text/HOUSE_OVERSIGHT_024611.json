If not,\nwe must find a way to balance our clear interest in defeating al-Qaeda\nand the Taliban against Pakistan’s continued stability—including our\nrelationship with Pakistan’s government, military and citizens.\nDennis Blair, forced to resign last year as director of national\nintelligence, has suggested coordinating drone strikes much more\nclosely with Islamabad.\n\nIn the longer run, China’s rise will clearly be a historic challenge to\nthe United States. Yet, while administration officials talk frequently\nabout China in domestic contexts, the president’s policy toward\nBeijing is fundamentally incoherent.\n\nTwo recent books, Henry Kissinger’s On China and Aaron\nFriedberg’s A Contest for Supremacy: China, America, and the\nStruggle for Mastery in Asia, suggest two very different\ninterpretations of Chinese conduct and propose alternative American\nresponses. Kissinger views China as a rising but thus far moderate\npower and warns against creating a self-fulfilling prophecy that could\nlead to zero-sum competition between Beijing and Washington. He\nargues that such rivalry could lead to a pre-World War I situation\nwith potentially devastating consequences for both nations and for\nthe rest of the world. Friedberg ridicules this approach, arguing that\nthe United States should seek to democratize China and, if this does\nnot succeed, should practice assertive containment. In his view, if the\nWorld War I analogy has any value, it is in demonstrating that the\nBritish were too timid in responding to Germany’s rise.\n\nKissinger and Friedberg offer coherent proposals that are mutually\nexclusive. Kissinger’s is much more persuasive to me, but there is a\nchoice—and America must make a decision. Accordingly, it is quite\ntroubling to see the Obama administration trying to have it both\nways: building a cooperative relationship with Being while visibly\nsiding with China’s neighbors in every dispute.
