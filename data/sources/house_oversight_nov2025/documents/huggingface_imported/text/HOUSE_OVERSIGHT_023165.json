During the course of\nthe conversation, he surprisingly asked what I would do with the peace process if I were\nhim. I had just re-read his autobiography, Warrior, and answered: “Both as a soldier\nand as a politician, you have a history of being bold, daunting, daring and making\nsurprise moves. In that spirit, 1 would suggest that you dismantle the settlements and\npull your troops completely out of Gaza.” For a minute I worried that this would anger\nhim, but he answered very calmly. “I cannot do it.” I asked why. He said: “Because of\nthe harbor.” I replied, rather perplexed: “But there is no harbor in Gaza.” He said:\n“That’s not the point. They could build one if we left Gaza.” Then I realized that,\ncontrary to common opinion, Sharon had no ideological inhibitions about leaving\nGaza. His concerns were only about security. This gave me high hopes that he would\neventually do it. Three years of stalemate were to follow. And then in December 2003,\nout of the blue, Sharon made the sweeping and stunning pronouncement that Israel\nwould leave Gaza and end its occupation of the Strip.\n\nAriel Sharon deserves praise for withdrawing from Gaza. But his unilateral move\nundermined the possibility of peaceful relations between the inhabitants of the Gaza\nStrip and Israel. The PLO and the Palestinian Authority were sidelined. They could not\nclaim credit for the move, and thus had scant motivation for supporting it. Instead,\nmilitants in Gaza and the West Bank harvested all the benefits. The Disengagement\nplan undermined those on the Palestinian side who claimed that the negotiating table\nwas a more efficient tool than the barrel of a gun in order to resolve the conflict.\n\nON PART II: PEACE PROPOSALS AND IDEAS\n\nThe formal agreements covered in Part I represent the conclusions of long and complex\ndiplomatic processes. Part II encompasses proposals and ideas that contributed to\nbreaking taboos and changing opinions that paved the way for precedent-setting\nagreements.\n\nIn the late 1970s and 1980s several plans and initiatives were put forward which\nmaintain relevance for the future of the peace process. One idea was a comprehensive\nand unified Arab approach which was first proposed in the Fahd Plan (1981), and later\nrefined in the Arab Peace Initiative of 2002. The latter peace proposal promoted by\nthen Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah al-Saud represented a unified shift in the Arab\nStates’ approach to Israel. Where there was once rejection, the Arab peace initiative\ncreated the possibility of universal recognition of the State of Israel. All 57 countries of\nthe Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC) endorsed the initiative.\n\nThe aftermath of the Gulf War of 1991 opened new opportunities to address the\ncomplex issue of peace in the Middle East. This was the backdrop for the groundbreak-\ning Madrid Peace Conference, convened by the United States and the Soviet Union. It\nraised new hopes for peaceful resolution to the enduring conflicts of the region. The\nconference created an unprecedented platform for peace talks, based on the principle of\n“land for peace”. The Israelis would have to cede land to their Arab adversaries in\nreturn for peace and security. The Madrid formula for organizing such talks followed a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023165",
