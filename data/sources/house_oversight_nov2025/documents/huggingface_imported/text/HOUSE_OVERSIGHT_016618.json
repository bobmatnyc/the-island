VAN BUREN\n\nMOTION PASSED UNANIMOUSLY\n\nE. Case # 08-2514, 235 Sunrise Ave., C8, C.J.’s Simply Gourmet, Inc.\nViolation of Chapter 46, Section 46-68 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of\nOrdinances, annual fire and life safety inspection fees not paid\n\nCode Enforcement Officer Gerry presented the facts of the case and recommended\na finding of non-compliance, administrative costs in the amount of $150.00 and\npayment of the fire inspection fee in addition to any late penalties by July 21, 2008.\nMr. Gerry said he also tried, with negative results, to make contact with the owner\nof this business as it is the same owner as the other case at this location. Mr.\nOchstein remarked that this was the same business which had been before the\nBoard previously and had even “bounced a check” to the Town and wanted to\nknow if there was something more that could be done other than the standard\n$150.00 costs. Mr. Gerry said he could review the case further to see if it could be\nbrought back for additional fines. Mr. Hoffman asked if these cases were brought\nto Code Enforcement by the Finance Department and Mr. Gerry said they came\nfrom the Fire Prevention Bureau who handles their own billing and explained the\nprocedure for that. Mr. Hoffman said it seemed like a year was a long time for\nthese cases to be in arrears. Mr. Gerry said the cases were coming over quicker\nnow from Fire Prevention and he thought it would improve in the future.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016618",
