The combined\ntechnology and health-care sectors constitute about\n40% of S&P 500 earnings today, almost three\ntimes as high as their 15% share in the late 1980s.\nBecause these faster-growing, higher-margin sectors\nare generally accorded premium valuations, their\nhigher representation in the index today justifies a\nhigher S&P 500 P/E multiple.\n\nExhibit 50: ISG S&P 500 Forecast—Year-End 2017\n\n2017 Year-End\n\nEnd 2017 S&P 500 Earnings\n\nGood Case (25%)\n\nOp.

Our\ncentral-case equity view for 2017 acknowledges\nthis, calling for some contraction in P/E multiples\ngiven the uncertainty associated with a new\nadministration and continued Federal Reserve\ninterest rate hikes. Even so, that headwind will be\nmore than offset by the 6-10% earnings growth\nwe forecast, resulting in a 1-5% total return for US\nequities this year (see Exhibit 50).\n\nInvestors might rightly ask whether it is worth\nbearing equity risk for such meager returns. Our\nread of the evidence suggests it is. The linchpin\nof this view is our expectation of a continued\n\nCentral Case (60%)\n\nOp. Earnings $125-130\nRep. Earnings $113—-117\nTrend Rep.
