The Non Prosecution Agreement stipulated that they would not be\ncharged. According to police reports and sworn statements in the civil suits, all four women, among their other duties,\nworked to ensure that an appointment book for twice- or thrice-daily “massages” was stocked with fresh recruits.\nGhislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late Czechoslovakian-born press baron Robert Maxwell, who was for many years\nEpstein’s live-in partner, also recruited young girls.\n\nSince his 13-month sentence for soliciting prostitution with a minor, Epstein has settled more than a dozen lawsuits\nbrought by underage girls. Seven victims reached a last-minute deal last week, days before a scheduled trial; each\nreceived well over $1 million—an amount that will hardly dent Epstein’s $2 billion net worth.\n\nThe victims told police they waited in the kitchen to be called upstairs for a massage, and the house chef often gave\nthem a bite to eat. House manager Alfredo Rodriguez said in his sworn statement that a maid named Lupita, who was\na devout Catholic, wept when she complained to him about cleaning up after the massage sessions, picking up soiled\ntowels and putting away the sex toys. And she was upset that a photo of Epstein with the pope hung next to one of\nhim with a young girl.\n\nIronically, Rodriguez, who ran the house on EI Brillo Way in 2004 and 2005, ended up being sentenced to more jail\ntime than his boss as a result of the complex investigation into Epstein’s activities. He was fired, he says, for\ninadvertently drawing police attention to one of the girls when she arrived at the house unannounced to collect money.\nHe saw an unfamiliar “beater” in the driveway one evening and called 911. When he left Epstein’s employ, Rodriguez\ntook away some notes and emails about massage appointments as “protection” against his own prosecution, and\nfailed to produce them during the Palm Beach Police Department’s initial investigation.\n\nUnable to get work as a house manager elsewhere in South Florida, he says, Rodriguez later tried to sell this “golden\nnugget’—his term—for $50,000, to be used in the victims’ civil suits. Unfortunately, he made the offer to an\nundercover cop, and was subsequently charged with “obstruction of official proceedings” for withholding information\nthat could have advanced the criminal investigation of Epstein—which by that point had been settled in a plea deal.\nRodriguez was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison (Epstein was allowed to serve 13 months in the Palm Beach\ncounty jail), and now awaits an additional sentence on Aug. 24 in federal court in Miami for transporting firearms,\nanother deal he says he made to pay the bills after he lost his job.\n\nIn a deposition given for the civil suits, Rodriguez testified that he was instructed to always have $2,000 in cash on\nhand, so that he could pay both the girls who gave massages and recruiters such as Haley Robson who brought them\nto the house. He also testified that Epstein made large contributions to the Palm Beach Police Department, and in\nreturn was given PBPD baseball hats to put on the dashboard of his various cars to avoid being stopped or ticketed by\nlocal police. Retired Police Chief Michael Reiter, in his own deposition, acknowledged that, in addition to earlier\ndonations to the police department (which are fairly common in well-heeled Palm Beach), Epstein had recently given\nthe department $100,000 for some sophisticated equipment. The police were still researching the purchase when\nEpstein came under suspicion, and Reiter ordered the money returned. (Guy Frostin, one of Epstein’s local attorneys,\ntold police that Epstein also gave $100,000 to the Florida Ballet for massages, because he was “very passionate”\nabout massages being “therapeutically and spiritually” beneficial. Yet victims told police they had no massage\ntraining.)\n\nPerhaps most disturbing, in terms of possible sex trafficking, was Epstein’s relationship with Jean Luc Brunel, owner\nof the MC2 modeling agency. According to a complaint filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of\nFlorida, an alleged victim said that Epstein, Maxwell, Brunel, Rodriguez, and Marcinkova “deliberately engaged in a\npattern of racketeering that involved luring minor children through MC2, mosily girls under the age of 17, to engage in\nsexual play for money.” (Which would amount to trafficking.)\n\nBrunel is a 50-plus French playboy who was formerly part owner of Karin, a Paris-based modeling agency. He lives in\nNew York and South Beach, Florida, and owns 85 percent of MC2, which has offices in New York, Miami, and Tel\n\nhttp://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-07-22/jeffrey-epstein-pedophile-billi... 7/23/2010\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021667 —",
