  "text": "phase portrait of the motion of this “harmonic oscillator,” is composed of a\n\n(continuous) series of points representing its location, graphed along x, its rate of\nmotion graphed along , y= = x and = co-localize the circular orbit as it speeds\n\nup and slows down while it bobs up and down. The transition from a fixed point (the\nmass at rest) to a circle (the bobbing mass), a bifurcation in phase space, results in\nthe loss of topological equivalence. That is, the phase space geometries before and\nafter the bifurcation cannot be smoothly distorted into each other. Continuity and\nconnectedness of the space is lost. For topological equivalence, stretching, bending\nand warping are allowed but not tearing apart and/or gluing together. Following the\nbifurcation of a fixed point into a circle, even limitless shrinking of the ring leaves a\nhole. The appearance or disappearance of an equilibrium fixed point (called a\n“saddle-node” bifurcation), splitting into two (“period doubling” bifurcation), its\nexploding into a circle (“Hopf’ bifurcation to a limit cycle), a circle splitting into two or\nmore incommensurate cycles (“secondary Hopf’ bifurcation) and these multiperiodic\n(“quasiperiodic”) dynamics breaking down into a recursive spirals (“homoclinic\nbifurcation to chaos”) are among the common bifurcations in nonlinear dynamical\n\nsystems, and all of them have been observed in many neurobiological settings.\n\nIn the forced-dissipative (energetically driven and energy consuming)\ndynamical systems relevant to the neurosciences---this characteristic contrasts with\nthe dissipation free momentum of the classical mechanics of astrophysical bodies---\nthere are four “most generic” bifurcation scenarios as a parameter changes that\nmay, but need not, lead to chaos (see below for definition) (for early and physically\noriented treatments see Eckmann, 1981; Ott, 1981; Berge’ et al, 1984, Kaneko,\n1983). These scenarios are: (1) Fixed point or cycle splittings into twice-as-long\nperiod lengths 1>2—>4-—8->16...called the subharmonic or “period doubling route”;\n(2) The transformation of fixed points to one and then more periodic orbits, multiple\nindependent (nonharmonic, incommensurate) frequency oscillations, their mode\nlockings and then breakdown called the “quasiperiodic route”; (3) Fixed point or\ncyclic equilibria metamorphosed into irregular bursting patterns called the\n\n“intermittency route”; and (4) In the context of quasiperiodic dynamics, adjacent\n\n195\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013695",
