  "text": "190 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nrepeat. To create the random number in my example above I went to www.\nrandom.org, a website that uses fluctuations in atmospheric quantum\nnoise to generate random numbers. As far as we know quantum effects\nare truly random and have neither rhyme nor reason.\n\nNumbers are more complex than they first appear. They are infinite,\nyet there are different infinities, and they have meaning. The smallpox\nexample above and the Turing numbers we will discover shortly suggest\nnumbers do have meaning independent of culture and language. The\nnext two chapters will show us what happens when we think about the\nmeaning of numbers. We will also explain one more ‘super infinity’ and\nthis will be the key to understanding creativity.\n\n“There are known knowns; there\nare things we know we know.\nWe also know there are known\nunknowns; that is to say we\nknow there are some things we\ndo not know. But there are also\nunknown unknowns - the ones\nwe dont know we don't know.”\n\nDonald Rumsfeld\nUnited States Secretary of Defense\n(2001-2006, 1975-1977)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015880",
