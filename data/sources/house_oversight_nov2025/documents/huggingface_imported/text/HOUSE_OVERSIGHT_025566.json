We believe that at cur-\nrent share prices, the market is valuing fee-related earnings 15.Ox.\nThis represents an 1.8x turn premium or +13% premium to current\ntraditional multiples on 2018e EPS of 13.2x. Using this as a starting\npoint, we see the market valuing performance fees at 7.5x on\naverage using a sum of the parts framework. If we assume C-corp\nconversion with a higher 24% tax rate, and believe alts@ee related\nearnings can re-rate from 15x to 22.5x, then we see the market valuing\n\nperformance fees at just 6.1x on average today.\n\nWhere should performance fee-related earnings trade? Given\nthat carry earnings (performance fees) are cyclical and historically\nvolatile, we look to Goldman Sachs as a comp for this earnings\nstream. On average since 2010 (post crisis) the FY2 price to earnings\nmultiple at GS has been 9.5x, with a standard deviation of 14x.\nWe see a range of multiples of +6.7x to +12.3x using two standard\ndeviations above and below the average. We see this as reasonable\nstarting point for valuing performance fees. The group average\nimplied future carry multiple of 7.5x is 1.4 standard deviations away\nfrom GS FY2 P/E multiple. If alts convert, we believe this multiple\nshould be able to move upward but will likely remain at a steep dis-\ncount to the FRE multiple given the volatile nature of the perform-\nance fees. In our upside case scenario, we bake in two turns of\nmultiple expansion from current implied rate for each company. This\nresults in median performance fee multiple across the group of 8.5x,\nabout slightly less than one standard deviation from GS FY2 multiple\nsince dating back to 2010.\n\nOn acash basis, the volatility of performance fee earnings (net\ncash carry) for the alts on a TTM basis has been fairly similar to\nthe volatility of Goldman Sachs@© operating earnings. For\nGoldman, we look at operating earnings both with and without\ninvestment management revenues to isolate the more volatile busi-\nnesses. The following bar graph looks at the standard deviation of\nthe year over year % change of the trailing twelve months earnings.\nThe alts average is 1.2 about double the volatility of GS (ex invest-\nment management) of 0.6. This suggests even further upside and\ngreater conviction in our multiples for performance fee multiples,\n\nespecially for those companies with less volatility (Carlyle and KKR).\n\nExhibit 24:\nWith a 24% tax rate on all earnings and a 22.5x FRE multiple, we\nsee future performance fees valued at and implied 6.1x multiple\non average.\n\nImplied Future\nCarry Multiple\n\nImplied Future\nCarry Multiple\nusing a 22.5x\nFRE multiple\n\nusing a 15.0x\nFRE multiple\n\nAPO 5.1x 2.0x\nARES 11.6x 8.4x\nBX 9.5x 9.3x\nCG 6.0x 7.1x\nKKR 7.0x 5.4x\nOAK 5.5x 4.5x\nAvg. 7.5x 6.1x\nMed. 6.5x 6.2x\n\nSource: Company Data, Morgan Stanley Research\n\nNote: We use a 18.4x multiple for ARES as the stock has already priced in much of the potential\nvalue of C-corp conversion Note 2: Scenario using 15x FRE does not use fully taxed net accrued\ncarry and future carry while the scenario using a 22.5x FRE multiple assumes C-corp conversion\nand full 24% effective tax rate on both net accrued carry and future carry earnings\n\nExhibit 25:\n\nGoldman sachs has historically traded at an average FY2 P/E of 9.5x\nand a standard deviation of 1.4x\n\nGS FY2 P/E Multiple\n\n14.0x\n13.0x\n12.0:x [RRR ey\nOO er le\n10.0x\n9.0x\n8.0x ee ee\n7.0x\n6.0x\n\n5.0x_ ; 1 1 1\nJan-10 Jan-12 Jan-14 Jan-16\n\nSource: Thomson Reuters, Company Data , Morgan Stanley research\n\n+2 St. Dev 12.3x\n\nj----| -1 St. Dev 10.9x.\n\nooo Avg 9.5x\n\naan nnn ne nn nnn nnn -1 St. Dev 8.1x\n\nSSeS eS ea ee eee. -2 St. Dev 6.7x\n\nJan-18\n\nNote.: Data includes daily FY2 P/E ratios to calculate standard deviation of P/E ratios using data begin-\nning January 2010\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025566",
