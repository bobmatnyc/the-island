He even went so far as to describe to\nthese journalists the secrets that he had taken as a “single point of\nfailure” for the NSA. And aside from the documents he had copied,\nhe claimed that the secret knowledge in his head, if he disclosed it,\nwould wreak havoc on U.S. intelligence. “If I were providing infor-\nmation that I know, that’s in my head, to some foreign government,\nthe US intelligence community would ...see sources go dark that\nwere previously productive,” he told the editor of The Guardian in\nMoscow.\n\nIn short, he advertised possessing priceless data that the Rus-\nsian intelligence services had been seeking, with little success, for\nthe past six decades. These electronic files could provide it with the\nkeys to unlock the NSA’s entire kingdom of electronic spying. Could\nany world-class intelligence service ignore such a prize? To miss the\nopportunity to get its hands on such a potential espionage source\nwould be nothing short of gross negligence.\n\nIn fact, this golden opportunity was not missed in Hong Kong.\n\n© Even if the Russian intelligence service had not previously had ®\nhim in its sights—which, as discussed earlier, appears to me to be\nextremely unlikely—he made contact with Russian officials in Hong\nKong, and Putin personally approved allowing Snowden to come to\nRussia.\n\nThis decision made it possible for Snowden, without an entry\nvisa to Russia, or, for that matter, any other country, to check in\nand board an Aeroflot flight to Moscow. We also know that a special\noperation was mounted to take Snowden off the plane once it landed\nin Moscow. Such an operation could not have been executed without\nadvance planning. Nor would he be removed from the plane without\na plan for his stay in Russia. Once Putin approved it, there is little\nreason to doubt that the plans to get Snowden to Moscow, and what-\never cover stories were deemed necessary to obscure them, had been\ncarried out professionally by Russia’s special services.\n\nWhen an intelligence service makes such elaborate preparations\nfor extracting a foreign intelligence worker, it presumably also\nexpects to debrief him or her on arrival.
