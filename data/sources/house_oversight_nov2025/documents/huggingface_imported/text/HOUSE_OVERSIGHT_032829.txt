Claims are ludicrous and self-serving, media is working with the other side’s lawyers, this is all about Donald

He never tries to explain. He denies, blames media, denigrates someone else.

At this point I don’t think you can go legalistic. They’ve won the high ground—young, vulnerable, poor

This thing as model journalism is one more element that could give it legs--so another danger. I don't
think it's a question now of directly debunking this. That's going against virtue itself. What I'd like to do
is game out everything, creating a structure for thinking this through. Definitely not a piecemeal
response. Figure out where we want to be and where we can reasonably get and work backwards.
Maybe we do agree to a big interview with you--Landon Thomas or something like that. But this has to
be war gamed out. Obviously I can contribute, Kathy can, would be great to get SB input, but this needs
a structure, that's why I think Hiltzig or somebody assembling a plan would be helpful. Even if in the
end you decide to do nothing, at least you've come up with a structured way to think about it.
