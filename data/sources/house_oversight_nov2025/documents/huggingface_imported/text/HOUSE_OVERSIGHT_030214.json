I've been spending lots of time with Irwin Corey and his family past two weeks especially.\nHe was in hospital until the last week and then He died a few hours ago peacefully at home in bed. Last\nnight he told me Trump will be assassinated soon. He was eager to learn the news each day. I asked him\nif he would join the anti Trump rallies when he gains strength. Doctors thought he might live many\nmonths. Alas he was laughing and smiling till the end and frowning about Trump.\n\n>> Warm and loving regards\n\n>>\n\n>> Jim Drougas\n< |\n>>\n\n>> My friend Alana, a young comedian, was here with him most nights. Irwin used to say he will live to\n147. Alana explained that 102 is 147 in comedian years.\n\n>>\n\n>>\n\n>\n\n>\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030214",
