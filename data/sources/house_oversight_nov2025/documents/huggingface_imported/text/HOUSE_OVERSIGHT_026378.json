It goes without saying that any move\nwould need to make economic sense. My assumption has been that your comp would fall outside of our \"bell\ncurve\", but that is not an issue for us as long as the potential contribution also falls outside. You would not be\nthe only partner outside the curve, and I am comfortable with expanding that group for people who can\ngenuinely move the needle while embracing the culture that makes us who we are.\n\nOne benefit of having Michael in the mix is that he can provide a global perspective, and he would be\nimportant for explaining the case outside the US if we moved forward.\n\nJust let me know when and how you want to speak next.\nBest,\n\nSteve\n\nStephen Immelt\nPartner and CEO\nHogan Lovells US LLP - Washington, DC office\nColumbia Square\n\n555 Thirteenth Street, NW\n\nWashington, DC 20004\n\nwww.hoganlovells.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026378",
