  "text": "Defining Intelligence 139\n\nThe premise here is that she isn’t actually stupid but was just con-\nfused by the moment and that she is intelligent because she is on the\nhonor roll at school, can explain lunar eclipses, and could answer the\noriginal question coherently, given sufficient time to do it (and maybe\nwith some help).\n\nThe media, for reasons of their own, decided to make this a feel-\ngood story and get people to feel better about Miss South Carolina.\nShe has continued to work in the media in various ways since the\noriginal interview.\n\nIam not concerned here with Miss South Carolina’s intelligence,\nbut with what it means to be seen as being intelligent. My premise is\nthat while native intelligence is certainly genetic, the perception of\nintelligence and what might be described as intelligent behavior can\nbe altered. (Perhaps this seems as incoherent a position as Miss South\nCarolina’s position on education.)\n\nThe curious thing about her second response is that it doesn’t\nanswer the original question at all. The question was about why she\nthought Americans were ignorant about geography, and she respond-\ned by saying that they weren’t but that maybe there should be more\neducation about reading maps, which in no way addresses the ques-\ntion about why Americans can’t locate the United States on a map.\n\nSo her answer is still awful even after she was given time to work\non it. It is simply unintelligent.\n\nThe question is: Could we make Miss South Carolina more intel-\nligent somehow? Clearly school hasn’t done it. (She was an honor\nstudent!) How might one do it?\n\nOf course, we really aren’t concerned with Miss South Carolina\nin particular. Consider the following interviews conducted at a Sarah\nPalin book signing in November 2009, in Columbus, Ohio. The\ninterviewees were all in line waiting to meet Sarah Palin and to buy\nher book:\n\nInterviewer: Tell us why you are here today.\n\nOlder woman: She stands for what America is.\n\nInterviewer: What do you mean by that?\n\nOlder woman: Freedom, liberty, right to speak . . .\n\nInterviewer: What are the particular issues you would like to see\nher bring to office?\n\nOlder woman: Oh, geez, help me out here, guys.\n\nSecond woman: Fairness. Realness.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023885",
