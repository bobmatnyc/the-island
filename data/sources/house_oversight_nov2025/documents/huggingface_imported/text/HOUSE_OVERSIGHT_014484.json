GBP is down 16% vs USD and\n11% on a trade weighted basis. In fact, a simple post-Brexit strategy of going equal\nweighted long UK-listed sectors with above market international sales exposure vs\nsectors with below market sales exposure would have delivered ~110% returns in USD.\n\nChart 52: GBP and sales exposure have been the key determinants for post-Brexit UK equity\n\nreturns\n3% UK MATERIALS $\n.\n20%\nm UK FD/STAPLES\noe = _ a CAP GDS$ ee\nUK INSURANCES UK}US K ENERGY $\n\n10% —r9\nOHGREAL ESORETAKNEISTES 8 UK DIV FINS\n$ a\n\n-30% / U\n\nUK PHIBIO L SCI$\nUK TICMBVS $ ees RS\n\nTRANSPT $\n\nPerformance since Brexit (%$ in USD)\n\n40%\n0% 10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90% 100%\n% International Sales exposure\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Factset.

To date, UK growth which has\nheld up better than many expected; policy uncertainty has fallen following a sharp spike;\ngilts are only 2bp higher than June 23” (although this masks a 85bp rally then 87bp sell-\noff); and the UK cost of equity is now down ytd.
