  "text": "Similarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In\nturn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and thus\nseemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy McCarthy\nentitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer than we are\naware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they must out\nmaneuver our conscious thinking.\n\nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of\nAmerica’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of hand\n(e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons, have had\nvirtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting on this\npoint).\n\nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a film,\nthere is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know there is\na threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc. This threat\nis typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial exposition\nshows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain it in\nfamiliar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The next\nstage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it, to\nappease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to not\nadequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes instead.\nThe final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters remain alive. I\nnamed this the “turnaround moment” when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as the threat. That\nchange in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for whichever\ncharacters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the threat.\n\nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny\nthat which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we\nstill have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.\n\nI said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid where\non the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of maneuvers the\nmany ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial, demonization, deflection,\ndeletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered upon these are moves such\nas projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in them or introject traits from\nthem into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve a mixing of identities where\nwe actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and introjection are active almost\nacross the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy accuses us of is more\nappropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be liked, and o ther\npsychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies.\n\nAs these narratives (“Our courts will never allow that,” “As a superpower we will always be able to win any\nfight we put our minds to,” “Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized” ...) gain consent from others\nthey tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship we\ntake with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this\nrelationship is the “transfer of responsibility” in which we assume responsibility for the enemy’s behavior who\nis addicted to transferring it away from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship and\nmakes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And just as\nan addict needs to devote serious effort and con sciousness to his addiction, so must we devote great energy to\nunders tanding how the Control Factor ultimately sabotages us.\n\nFP: Describe the threat we face in our Islamic enemy. And you talk about the three levels of jihad against us.\nWhat are they?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024397",
