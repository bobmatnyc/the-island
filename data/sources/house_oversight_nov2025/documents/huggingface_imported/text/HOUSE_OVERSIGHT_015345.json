  "text": "On ABC’ s Women’ s Murder Club, a medical examiner directs her\ngaze to the crotch of a female corpse and says, “That’ s not your\nmama’ s bikini wax.\" On 7he View, Joy Behar said, “No pubic hair\ncreates a wind tunnel.” And in a hysterical episode of HBO’ s dark\ncomedy series, Curb Your Enthusiasm, former Se/nfe/d producer Larry\nDavid performed oral sex on his wife, and in the process he sort of\nswallowed one of her pubic hairs. The next day, he was still choking on it,\nlike a cat trying to get rid of a hairball.\n\nA psychologist at Harvard Medical School and author of Survival of\nthe Prettiest: The Science of Beauty, Nancy Etcoff, writes that “There’ s\nalso an erotic, sexual component to hairlessness because your skin is more\nsensitive when it’ s more exposed. Women today are emulating porn stars\nwho have no pubic hair, and | think men like it.”\n\nMy own resistance to the plethora of bald pussies stems from my\npre-adolescent days when pubic hair was such a big taboo that | became\nobsessed with it. In those pre-bikini days, | would go to Coney Island and\nstroll around the sand, sneaking glances at ladies in the hope of finding a\nfew stray curlicues of forbidden pubic hair peeking out from their various\nand sun-dried crotches. And if | was able to discover any, why, it felt as\n\nthough | had experienced a really productive afternoon.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015345",
