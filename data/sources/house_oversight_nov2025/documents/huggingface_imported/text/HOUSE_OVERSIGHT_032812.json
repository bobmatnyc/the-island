The\n\ninvestigation is focused on Rubenfeld’s conduct, particularly with female law students. Students have also\nraised related concerns to Yale authorities about Chua’s powerful influence in the clerkships process. The\ninvestigation was initiated before Kavanaugh was nominated by Donald Trump to serve on the high court.\n\nRubenfeld said in a statement to the Guardian: “In June, Yale University informed me that it would conduct\nwhat it terms an ‘informal review’ of certain allegations, but that to preserve anonymity, I was not entitled to\nknow any specifics. As a result, I do not know what I am alleged to have said or done. I was further advised that\nthe allegations were not of the kind that would jeopardize my position as a long-tenured member of the faculty.\n\nplease note\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
