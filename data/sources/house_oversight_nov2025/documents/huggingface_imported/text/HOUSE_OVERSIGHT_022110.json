  "text": "CHAPTER 36\n\n2002\n\nlary editor of Vanity Fair, likes to\nyell before the rest of his staff\n\nyerate at a leisurely pace—three\nassigning articles, and shooting\non followed by one frantic week\ns done. But this isn’t the case at\nitting investigative pieces along-\n;. There are also parties to plan\nus parties, including the annual\n\ne fun and far more exclusive than F\nny itself.
