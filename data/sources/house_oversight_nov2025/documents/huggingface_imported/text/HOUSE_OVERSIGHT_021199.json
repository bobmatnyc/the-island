  "text": "side of the fence where the grass wasn’t so green. Fortunately for me and\nin some ways not, | was mostly expected to attend to only Jeffrey’s\ninsurmountable of sexual desires. Whereas the other girls who came one\nday and went the next were promised a multitude of open doors just for\nthere meager participation in sexual acts with random men, only to be\ndisappointed when they realized they were nothing more than a single\nnight out for these geriatric senior citizens who most likely due\nAlzheimer’s would sooner forget the entire experience let alone their first\nname.\n\nSurrounded by those in our world who many looked up too but not\nseeing them from where | was standing, | didn’t have the highest of\nstandards in humanity. Then I met Al Gore and his lovely wife during\none of those many weekends away in the Caribbean. I was blown away\nby the amount of attention Al doted on his wife, it was so sweet to watch.\nThey sat next to each other at the dinner table gazing into one another’s\neyes having an intimate conversation between them. Among the many\nguests visiting that night and many of them young beautiful women, not\nonce did Al’s eye’s stray elsewhere, to them they were the only ones\nthere. He was up for a presidential election that year and he definitely had\nmy vote. Anyone that could show that much devotion and passion\ntowards his loved ones could have the same devotion towards running a\ncountry, or at least I thought so. He only left his wife’s side to have a\nwalk down to the beach with the host of the weekend, Jeffrey. The\nweather was still warm in the evening when I decided to break away from\nthe idle chat around the table and take a stroll too.\n\nNot wanting to interrupt the conversation between Jeffrey and Al, I\nwalked in the opposite direction plucking the washed up sea shells\nimbedded in the sand along the way. I enjoyed the serenity in the solitude\nof the island. So many nooks and crannies to get lost in, I could imagine\nthat I actually disappeared from the entire world for a moment. By the\ntime I came back to the main house majority of the small crowd had been\nlong gone retired to their cabanas. Even Jeffrey had gone off to bed but\ntrust party animal Ghislane to still be up entertaining the remaining guests\nleft at the table, regaling her wild stories of people and places she has\nembarked on. Trying not to make eye contact as I walked past them on\nmy way back to my cabana carrying my seashells inside my curled up\nblouse, I wasn’t up for anymore pointless talking tonight. Emptying out\nmy seashells into a plastic bag, I went over my new treasures one by one.\nI loved collecting odd things, shells being one of my favorites.\n\nGhislane and I shared that interest together. We would enjoy walk\nabouts around the island searching for lost pieces of the remnants that\npirate’s had left behind centuries ago. It was mostly broken plates or\nsmashed glass from bottles of ale, and even occasionally getting lucky\n\n109\n\nenough to find some old coins here and there. It wasn’t easy though, both\nloving a challenge it was perfect for us. Enduring many scratches from\nthe bushes we would be searching through and then the soar arms from\ndigging all day, but it was worth it in the end. After nearly two years of\ncollecting items and saving them, we made Jeffrey a mosaic table out of\nthe remaining pieces left from the era of the pirate’s day. Upon\ncompleting it we were both astounded in our creation, it was such an item\nof rarity and an interesting piece of work. When we presented it to Jeffrey\nhe was even impressed not only in our amazing finds but what we did\nwith them. The table became an important work of art that Jeffrey\nshowed off inside the main house’s lounge room, sparking a much\nintrigue and table conversation by many of the visiting guests to his\nisland.\n\nThe next moming was good-bye for most of the visitors, leaving just\nthe usual behind. Soaking in the sun and living it up in the lap of luxury is\nhow the next few weeks were spent before having to get back to the\ndredge of the city. Sometimes we'd have to go to St. Johns island for\nJeffrey to do some work in the office. It was so boring for me to sit in\ntheir listening to him on the phone or coming down on some poor\nemployee for something stupid like not answering the phone correctly. If\nI knew he was going to be awhile I would excuse myself for a bit of\nshopping. Not that the Caribbean had much to offer in the world of\nfashion but there was never an amount of bikinis one girl could own and I\nloved all the little knick knacks one could find there. Flying back on a\nprivate jet was the best part because I could transport just about anything\nI wanted back to my apartment, which was already filled with an\nassortment from my shopping ventures and collection of seashells from\nthe Caribbean.\n\nThe next big dinner party on the island had another significant guest\nappearance being, the one and only, Bill Clinton. He is the only president\nin the world to be dismissed from his role as a world leader because he\nwas caught with his trousers around his ankles and had the stain to prove\nit. Publicly humiliating his wife and himself he retired from his title but\nnot from his lifestyle. This wasn’t a big party as such, only a few of us\neating at the diner table. There was Jeffrey at the head of it all, as always.\nOn the left side was Emmy, Ghislane and I. Sitting across the table from\nus was Bill with two lovely girls who were visiting from New York.\nBill’s wife, Hillary’s absence from the night made it easy for his apparent\nprovocative cheeky side to come out. Teasing the girls on either side of\nhim with playful pokes and brassy comments, there was no modesty\nbetween any of them. We all finished our meals and scattered in our own\ndifferent directions.\n\n110\n\n(1 Copyright Protected Material (0 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004242 CONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004243\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021199",
