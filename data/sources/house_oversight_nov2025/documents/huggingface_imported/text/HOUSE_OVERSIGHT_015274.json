  "text": "Swimming in the Dead Pool\n\nWhen Ken Kesey’ s son Jed was killed in an accident--the van\n\ncarrying his University of Oregon wrestling team had skidded off a cliff--I\nimmediately flew to Oregon. “You were his favorite,” Kesey said as we\nembraced, sobbing. “I feel like every cell in my body is exploding,”\n\nA few days later, several of us old friends were sitting around the\ndining-room table there, and someone mentioned that the Dead\nKennedys were on tour.\n\n“| wonder if Ted Kennedy is gonna go see’ em,” | remarked.\n\nKesey, standing in the kitchen, responded, “That’ s not funny.”\n\n“You' re right. | apologize. It’ s not very abstract right now.”\n“It' s never abstract.”\n\n| recalled that little dialogue as | began to explore The Game, now in\nits 34th year [2004], the longest-running dead pool in America, currently\nwith 125 players. Before January 1st everyone submits 68 names of people\nwho might die that year. (Dr. Death, co-founder of The Game, liked to\nwork on a legal pad--34 lines, two columns, hence 68 names.) Points are\nawarded according to the age of each dead person--anybody in their 50s\n\nis worth five points; 60s, four; 70s, three.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015274",
