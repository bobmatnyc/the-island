  "text": "32\n\nAdvisory Opinion.\n\nOne can give an example of the fruits of such good investment by\nreferring to what the prominent Israeli leading newspaper Ha'aretz\nwrote in June 2011.\n\nIt referred to what several Israeli jurists and international law experts\nwere aware of: \"Palestine adhering to the Rome Statute of 1998 (the\nICC Statute), thus becoming a member of the ICC capable of\ninvoking its jurisdiction in cases of Israel committing war-crimes of\nother similar crimes\".\n\nSuch membership 1s possible if many states and/or members of the\nICC Statute are finally convinced that Palestine is a state which is\nworth becoming a member of the said convention. In this regard, it\nmust be highlighted that the ICC Statute does not provide for states to\nbecome members of the ICC but that they should be members of the\nUNO. It only demands in all its Articles that Member States should\nbe \"States\".\n\nIf support for Palestine is very high, it constitutes great pressure on\nseveral states and may be a turning point in their attitude towards\nPalestinian Statehood.\n\nAbdullah Abu Eid is a professor of international law and human\nrights at Birzeit University\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024623",
