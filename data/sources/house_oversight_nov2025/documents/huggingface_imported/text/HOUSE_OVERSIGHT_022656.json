[jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSubject: Re: off the record \nImportance: High \nLets have a chat -- you do need to fight back some how. Present evidence that she is lying AND show \nthe world that you are no longer that guy. You have made changes -- and that this is the past. My \nsense is that its TV type thing where you just talk honestly about this/present evidence that its not \ntrue/ and focus on what you have been doing for past five years. Charlie Rose? \nBut you cant just sit there taking punches like this -- especially wen the British tabs are driving this. \nMaybe you go on British TV.... \nCall me any time. \nOn Fri, Jan 9, 2015 at 1:08 PM, jeffrey E. <jeevacation@gmail.com> wrote: \nLandon. the story teller , crafted much of it out of whole cloth. . part of her story, is that \nshe was at multiple orgies with clinton and speciifically, the minute details of a dinner had on the island with \nhim, \" he sat on my left. came by black. heli. flown by ghislaine. clinton was NEVER EVER \nthere, never, it punches a hole in the dershowitz , andrew allegation. making it all apparent that it was \nfantasy. and delusional. thoughts. who should break the story. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
