  "text": "54024\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nindividual provisions in this section of\nthe notice received numerous comments\nand suggestions for improvement. The\nvast majority of the comments about the\nspecific provisions are from\nrepresentatives of employers. Those\ncomments generally contend that the\nprovisions are overgeneralizations and\ndo not articulate the legal standard for\nevaluating allegations of unlawful\nconduct or indicate factual scenarios in\nwhich certain employer conduct may be\nlawful.\n\nAfter reviewing all of the comments,\nthe Board has decided to revise one of\nthe examples of unlawful employer\nconduct contained in the NPRM. The\nBoard concludes that the other\nprovisions, as proposed, are accurate\nand informative and, as with the notice\nas a whole, strike an appropriate\nbalance between being simultaneously\ninstructive and succinct.\n\nFurthermore, the Board sees no reason\nto add or subtract from the employer or\nunion illegal activity to make the two\nsections contain an equal number of\nparagraphs. The comment that argues\nthat no imbalance exists in the statute\nis correct, but the majority of violations\nunder Section 8(b) concern union\nconduct vis-a-vis employers, not\nconduct that impairs employees’ rights.\nThe notice of rights is intended to\nsummarize employer and union\nviolations against employees;\naccordingly, there is no need to alter the\nlist to include unlawful union activity\nagainst employers.\n\ni. No-Solicitation and No-Distribution\nRules\n\nThe Board received a few comments\nthat were critical of the proposed notice\nlanguage stating that an employer\ncannot lawfully prohibit employees\nfrom “soliciting for the union during\nnon-work time or distributing union\nliterature during non-work time, in non-\nwork areas.”’ The Service Employees\nInternational Union comments that\n“solicitation” has a narrow meaning and\ninvolves asking someone to join the\nunion by signing an authorization card,\nwhich is subject to the restrictions\nsuggested in the notice. The comment\nsubmits that the notice should state that\nan employer cannot prohibit employees\nfrom “talking” about a union. The\ncomment suggests that ‘“‘talking” is both\nmore accurate and is easier for\nemployees to understand than\n“soliciting.”\n\nThe remaining comments criticize the\nprovision for failing to note any\nlimitations on employees’ rights to\nsolicit and distribute, such as the\nlimited rights of off-duty employees,\nand limitations in retail and health care\n\nestablishments. One comment, in\nparticular, suggests the notice should\nadvise healthcare employees that they\ndo not enjoy a protected right to solicit\nin immediate patient care areas or\nwhere their activity might disturb\npatients. See Beth Israel Hosp. v. NLRB,\n437 U.S. 483 (1978). The comment\nproposes to include a qualification that\na hospital or other health care employer\nmay prohibit all solicitation in\nimmediate patient care areas or outside\nthose areas when necessary to avoid\ndisrupting health care operations or\ndisturbing patients. Another comment\nsuggests that the law in this area is so\ncomplex that no meaningful but\nsuccinct provision can be constructed,\nand therefore recommends deleting it\nentirely.\n\nThe Board disagrees with those\ncomments. The Board appreciates that\nunder case law, employees’ right to\nengage in solicitation and distribution of\nliterature is qualified in certain settings\nand accordingly that employers may, in\nsome situations, legally prohibit\nsolicitation or distribution of literature\neven during employees’ nonworking\ntime. Given the variety of circumstances\nin which the right to solicit and\ndistribute may be limited, however, the\nBoard has determined that limitations\non the size and format of the notice\npreclude the inclusion of factual\nsituations in which an employer may\nlawfully limit such activity. As stated\nabove, employees may contact the NLRB\nwith specific questions about the\nlawfulness of their employers’ rules\ngoverning solicitation and literature\ndistribution.\n\nTurning to the suggestion that the\nnotice should be modified to remove the\nreference to union solicitation in favor\nof a reference only to the right to engage\nin union talk, the Board agrees in part.\nThe Board distinguishes between\nsoliciting for a union, which generally\nmeans encouraging a co-worker to\nparticipate in supporting a union, and\nunion talk, which generally refers to\ndiscussions about the advantages and\ndisadvantages of unionization. Scripps\nMemorial Hosp., 347 NLRB 52 (2006).\nThe right to talk about terms and\nconditions of employment, which\nwould necessarily include union talk, is\nencompassed more specifically by the\n“discussion’’ provision in the\naffirmative rights section of the notice.\nThat provision indicates that employees\nhave the right to “‘discuss your terms\nand conditions of employment or union\norganizing with your co-workers or a\nunion.” In order to maintain\nconsistency and clarity throughout the\nnotice, the Board agrees that some\nchange is necessary to the solicitation\n\nprovision. Accordingly, the final notice\nwill state that it is illegal for an\nemployer to ‘‘prohibit you from talking\nabout or soliciting for a union during\nnon-work time, such as before or after\nwork or during break times; or from\ndistributing union literature during non-\nwork time, in non-work areas, such as\nparking lots or break rooms.”\n\nii. Questioning Employees About Union\nActivity\n\nThe Board received one comment\nconcerning this provision, suggesting\nthat it was confusing. The Board\nbelieves the existing language is\nsufficiently clear.\n\niii. Taking Adverse Action Against\nEmployees for Engaging in Union-\nRelated Activity\n\nThe Board did not receive any\nspecific comments regarding this\nprovision.\n\niv. Threats To Close\n\nA few comments from employer\ngroups criticize the perceived\novergeneralization of this provision.\nThose comments note that, as with\nunlawful interrogation, a threat to close\nis evaluated under a totality of\ncircumstances, and that an employer is\npermitted to state the effects of\nunionization on the company so long as\nthe statement is based on demonstrably\nprobable consequences of unionization.\n\nThe Board agrees that the law in this\ngeneral area is complex and that\npredictions of plant closure based on\ndemonstrably probable consequences of\nunionization may be lawful. NLRB v.\nGissel Packing Co., 395 U.S. 575, 618\n(1969). However, the example in the\nproposed notice is not such a\nprediction; rather, the notice states that\nit is unlawful for an employer to\n“threaten to close your workplace if\nworkers choose a union to represent\nthem.” Such a statement, which clearly\nindicates that the employer will close\nthe plant in retaliation against the\nemployees for choosing union\nrepresentation, is unlawful. Jd. at 618-\n619. Thus, the Board finds it\nunnecessary to modify or delete this\nprovision of the notice.\n\nv. Promising Benefits\n\nThe Board received one comment\naddressing this provision. The comment\nargues that the provision is “troubling”\nbecause it may be interpreted by a\nreader to mean “anytime their employer\nseeks to make such improvements it\ndiscourages union support because\nimproved wages and benefits may\nreduce employee’s interest in a union.”\nThe Board does not think such an\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022295",
