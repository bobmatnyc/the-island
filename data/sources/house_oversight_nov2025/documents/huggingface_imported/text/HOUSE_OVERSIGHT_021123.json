  "text": "XII AUTHOR’S NOTE\n\n4 4%\n\nI am joined in my train-wreck fascination with Trump—that certain\nknowledge that in the end he will destroy himself—by, I believe, almost\neveryone who has encountered him since he was elected president.\nTo have worked anywhere near him is to be confronted with the most\nextreme and disorienting behavior possible. That is hardly an overstate-\nment. Not only is Trump not like other presidents, he is not like anyone\nmost of us have ever known. Hence, everyone who has been close to him\nfeels compelled to try to explain him and to dine out on his head-smacking\npeculiarities. It is yet one more of his handicaps: all the people around\nhim, however much they are bound by promises of confidentiality or\nnondisclosure agreements or even friendship, cannot stop talking about\ntheir experience with him. In this sense, he is more exposed than any\npresident in history.\n\nMany of the people in the White House who helped me during the\nwriting of Fire and Fury are now outside of the administration, yet they are\nas engaged as ever by the Trump saga. I am grateful to be part of this sub-\nstantial network. Many of Trump’s pre-White House cronies continue to\nboth listen to him and support him; at the same time, as an expression both\nof their concern and of their incredulity, they report among one another,\nand to others as well, on his temper, mood, and impulses. In general, I\nhave found that the closer people are to him, the more alarmed they have\nfound themselves at various points about his mental state. They all spec-\nulate about how this will end—badly for him, they almost all conclude.\nIndeed, Trump is probably a much better subject for writers interested in\nhuman capacities and failings than for most of the reporters and writers\nwho regularly cover Washington and who are primarily interested in the\npursuit of success and power.\n\nMy primary goal in Siege is to create a readable and intuitive narrative—\nthat is its nature. Another goal is to write the near equivalent of a real-time\nhistory of this extraordinary moment, since understanding it well after\nthe fact might be too late. A final goal is pure portraiture: Donald Trump\nas an extreme, almost hallucinatory, and certainly cautionary, Amer-\nican character. To accomplish this, to gain the perspective and to find\n\nAUTHOR’S NOTE XIII\n\nthe voices necessary to tell the larger story, I provided anonymity to any\nsource who requested it. In cases where I have been told—on the prom-\nise of no attribution—about an unreported event or private conversation\nor remark, I have made every effort to confirm it with other sources or\ndocuments. In some cases, I have witnessed the events or conversations\ndescribed herein. With regard to the Mueller investigation, the narrative\nI provide is based on internal documents given to me by sources close to\nthe Office of the Special Counsel.\nDealing with sources in the Trump White House has continued to\noffer its own set of unique issues. A basic requirement of working there\nis, surely, the willingness to infinitely rationalize or delegitimize the truth,\nand, when necessary, to outright lie. In fact, I believe this has caused some\nof the same people who have undermined the public trust to become pri-\nvate truth-tellers. This is their devil’s bargain. But for the writer, interview-\ning such Janus-faced sources creates a dilemma, for it requires depending\non people who lie to also tell the truth—and who might later disavow the\ntruth they have told. Indeed, the extraordinary nature of much of what\nhas happened in the Trump White House is often baldly denied by its\nspokespeople, as well as by the president himself. Yet in each successive\naccount of this administration, the level of its preposterousness—even as\nthat bar has been consistently raised—has almost invariably been con-\nfirmed.\nIn an atmosphere that promotes, and frequently demands, hyperbole,\ntone itself becomes a key part of accuracy. For instance, most crucially,\nthe president, by a wide range of the people in close contact with him, is\noften described in maximal terms of mental instability. “I have never met\nanyone crazier than Donald Trump” is the wording of one staff member\nwho has spent almost countless hours with the president. Something like\nthis has been expressed to me bya dozen others with firsthand experience.\nHow do you translate that into a responsible evaluation of this singular\nWhite House? My strategy is to try to show and not tell, to describe the\nbroadest context, to communicate the experience, to make it real enough\nfor a reader to evaluate for him- or herself where Donald Trump falls on a\nvertiginous sliding scale of human behavior. It is that condition, an emo-\ntional state rather than a political state, that is at the heart of this book.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021123",
