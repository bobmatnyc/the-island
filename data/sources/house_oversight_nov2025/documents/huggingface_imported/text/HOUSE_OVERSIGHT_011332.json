Defendant's purported\nexpert's evaluation of this is wholly flawed, as explained in\nMs. Giuffre's motion in limine on the same.\n\nSimilarly, Ms. Giuffre's taxes are wholly irrelevant\n\nto this case. Even actions brought by the government, your\n\nHonor, where the cause of action is centered on nontax\n\ncomplianc xclud vidence of prior tax noncompliance when it\n\ntakes the case too far afield of the issue being tried.\n\nCourts also exclude this evidence under 403 if there's\n\nno substantial nexus between the alleged tax noncompliance and\n\nthe matter at hand. Here, defendant fails to show any type of\n\nsubstantial nexus to this defamation claim. None whatsoever.\nAdditionally, resolving Ms. Giuffre's tax compliance,\nthis is a point that's in dispute among the parties, and\n\nresolving such an issue would also involve another mini trial\n\nwhere Ms. Giuffre would put on evidence of her tax compliance\nand, at the end of that mini trial, the jury would have no more\ninformation whether or not defendant defamed Ms. Giuffre when\nshe called her a liar about being sexually abused. Trying to\nmake this an issue, this is simply a device for putting the\n\nsettlement agreement and the amount between Ms. Giuffre and\n\nJeffrey Epstein into evidence.\n\nAs has been briefed extensively, such a settlement\n\npayment is tax exempt under the United States law, but that's\n\nall this is, it's a device to try to get an improper admission\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011332",
