  "text": "of direct payments for tuition and medical expenses are subject to GST but for this special exclusion.\nAlso, although HEETs have been written about in planning publications, it is unclear how often they are\nactually implemented: donors who use their GST exemption for multi-generational trusts often feel that\nthey've done “enough” for those lower generations, and may lack the charitable intent necessary for the\nHEET to work. In addition, given life’s uncertainties, trust creators may be reluctant to limit trust\ndistributions to tuition and medical expenses only.\n\nTax “carried” (profits) interests as ordinary income. In exchange for their services on behalf of\nhedge funds and private equity funds, managers of these entities are often compensated with what are\ncalled “carried interests,” or profits from the entity. Because these profits interests are structured as\npartnership interests, they pass through long-term capital gain to the partners/managers, and are\ntherefore taxed at preferential rates. The proposal would not recharacterize the treatment of a partner’s\ninvestment in the entity, but would tax as ordinary income what is viewed as compensation for the\npartner’s investment management services for the partnership. Thus, a partner’s share of income in an\n“investment services partnership interest” (ISPI), regardless of how the income is characterized at the\npartnership level, would be taxed as ordinary income, and would also be subject to self-employment tax.\nAn ISPI is an interest in future profits of an “investment partnership”; an investment partnership is one in\nwhich substantially all of the entity’s assets are investment-type assets, such as certain securities, real\nestate, interests in partnerships, commodities, cash or cash equivalents, or derivative contracts related\nto those assets.\n\nTighten up conservation easements. Donors of conservation easements typically get a charitable\ndeduction for the permanent restrictions they put on property that will be used exclusively for\nconservation purposes. Recent court decisions have upheld large deductions for easements preserving\nrecreational amenities, including golf courses, surrounded by upscale homes. These contributions have\nraised concerns that the deductions claimed are excessive and seem to promote private interests rather\nthan bona fide conservation activities. The proposal would prohibit a deduction for a conservation\neasement on a golf course. A second proposal would address historic preservation easements, and\nwould disallow a deduction for restricting the “upward development” of an historic building, since such\ndevelopment is typically already restricted under local ordinances. In addition, conservation easements\non buildings listed in the National Register would need to comply with the same (more stringent) rules\napplicable to buildings in a registered historic district.\n\nLimit protracted payout for non-spouse beneficiaries of IRAs and retirement plans. Under current\nlaw, a non-spouse beneficiary of an IRA or a retirement plan (such as a 401(k)) must begin taking\n“required minimum distributions” (RMDs) from the account the year after the account owner’s death, but\ncan spread those distributions out over her life expectancy. Thus, if widowed Mom names Child as\nbeneficiary of her IRA, for example, and Child is 40 when Mom dies, Child’s RMDs can last over 40\nyears, assuming those are the only distributions Child takes from the account. The proposal would\nchange this rule, and in general would require that non-spouse beneficiaries withdraw the balance of the\nretirement account within five years after the owner’s death. (Certain exceptions would apply for\n“eligible” beneficiaries, such as those who are disabled, chronically ill or a child under the age of\nmajority.) The reason for the proposed change is that retirement accounts were intended to benefit\nowners and their spouses, and not heirs such as children and grandchildren.\n\nComments. It is not surprising to see this proposal, as last year, something similar was in a highway\nbill, but was then pulled. Given the need for revenue, limiting the generous protracted payouts currently\n\npermitted for non-spouse beneficiaries seems like low-hanging fruit. If enacted, the proposal would\npotentially make it less attractive for owners of substantial traditional IRAs to convert that IRA into a Roth\n\nTax Topics 04/29/13 4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022364",
