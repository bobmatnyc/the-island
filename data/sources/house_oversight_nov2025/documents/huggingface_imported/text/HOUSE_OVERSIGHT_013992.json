  "text": "Last but Not Least\n> THE BEST OF THE BLOG\n\nThe Art of Letting Bad Things Happen\n\n[AFTER 3 WEEKS OFF OF THE BLOG]\n\nLoong time no see! I just landed back in California from a long overdue mini-retirement through\n\nLondon, Scotland, Sardinia, the Slovak Republic, Austria, Amsterdam, and Japan. Some unpleasant\nsurprises awaited me when I checked in on the evil e-mail inbox. Why? I let them happen.\n\nI always do.\n\nHere are just a few of the goodies that awaited me this time:\n\ne » One of our fulfillment companies had been shut down due to the\nCEO’s death, causing a 20%+ loss in monthly orders and\nrequiring an emergency shift of all web design and order\nprocessing\n\ne» Missed radio and magazine appearances and upset would-be\ninterviewers\n\ne » More than a dozen lost joint-venture partnership opportunities\n\nIt’s not that I go out of my way to irritate people—not at all—but I recognize one critical fact:\nOftentimes, in order to do the big things, you have to let the small bad things happen. This is a skill we\nwant to cultivate.\n\nWhat did I get in exchange for temporarily putting on blinders and taking a few glancing blows?\n\ne » I followed the Rugby World Cup in Europe and watched the New\nZealand All Blacks live, a dream I’ve had for the last five years.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013992",
