  "text": "10\n\nIn policy terms, this has been enormous mission creep far beyond our\nnational interests. The current U.S. counterinsurgency strategy\nappears likely to fail. Washington and its allies will not defeat the\nTaliban militarily. President Hamid Karzai’s corrupt government is\nunlikely to improve significantly. The Afghan National Army cannot\ntake over combat missions from the U.S. in southern and eastern\nAfghanistan in any realistic time frame. And the Pakistan army will\nnot move against Afghan Taliban sanctuaries in Pakistan.\n\nDe facto Afghan partition offers the Obama administration the best\nalternative to strategic defeat. The administration should stop setting\nwithdrawal deadlines and instead commit the United States to a long-\nterm combat role in Afghanistan, with roughly 35,000 to 50,000\ntroops, for the next seven to 10 years.\n\nWashington should also accept that the Taliban are likely to control\nmost of the Pashtun south and east. The price of forestalling that is\nfar too high for Americans to continue paying. Washington and its\npartners should let the local correlation of forces take its course in the\nPashtun homeland — while deploying U.S. air power and Special\nForces to ensure that the north and west of Afghanistan do not\nsuccumb to the Taliban.\n\nIn Libya, the president has gotten us militarily into the middle of a\ncivil war in a country of little importance to the United States. And he\noffers no clear strategy to reach his ambitious objectives. The\nadministration’s inconsistent, even incoherent, statements on the\nLibya war wrestle each other for dominance in the daily news cycle,\nwhile NATO predictably founders without robust U.S. leadership.\nThe U.S. should quickly end its military role in the Libyan civil war.\nWe should leave that to the European allies — if they want to take it\nup — and return to issues of far greater importance to our country,\nlike our fiscal problems.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030039",
