  "text": "Polygraph shows he didn’t know girls’ ages, lawyer says\n\np> EPSTEIN fom 1B\n\nusing the name “Pimpin’\nMade EZ.” Robson, who was\nnot charged in the case, is a\npotential prosecution wit-\nness.\n\nAccording to Recarey,\nprosecutor Lanna Belohlavek\noffered Epstein attorneys\nDershowitz and Guy Fronstin\na plea deal in April. Fronstin,\nafter speaking with Epstein,\naccepted the deal, in which\nEpstein would plead guilty to\none count of aggravated as-\nsault with intent to commit a\nfelony, be placed on five\nyears’ probatton and have no\ncriminal record. The deal al-\nso called for Epstein to sub-\nmit to a psychiatric and sex-\nual evaluation and have no\nunsupervised visits with mi-\nnors, according to Recarey’s\nreport. The plea bargain was\nmade in connection with only\none of the five alleged vic-\ntims, the report states.\n\nFronstin — who declined\nto comment on the case —\n‘was subsequently fired and\nveteran defense attorney\nJack Goldberger was hired.\nHe denies there was any\nagreement by any of Ep-\nstein’s attorneys to a plea\n\ndeal.\n\n“We absolutely did not\nagree to a plea in this case,”\nhe said. Neither Belohlavek\nnor a4 state attorney’s\nspokesman could be reached\nfor comment.\n\nThe parent or parents of\nalleged victims who com-\n\nplained of being harassed by\nprivate investigators provid-\ned license tag numbers of two\nof the men. Police found the\nvehicles were registered to a\nprivate eye in West Palm\nBeach and another in Jupiter,\naccording to Recarey’s re\nport.\n\n“I have no knowledge of\nit,” defense attorney Gold-\nberger said.\n\nThe report also says a\nwoman connected to the Ep-\nstein case was contacted by\nsomebody who was still in\ntouch with Epstein. That\nperson told her she would be\ncompensated if she didn’t\ncooperate with police, Re\ncarey’s report says, Those\nwho did talk “will be dealt\nwith,” the woman said she\nwas told. Phone records\nshow the woman tallxed with\nthe person who allegedly in-\ntimidated her around the\ntime she said, Recarey re-\nported.\n\nPhone records also show\nthat the person said-to have\nmade the threat then placed a\ncall to Epstein’s personal as-\nsistant, who in turn called a\nNew York corporation affilt-\nated with Epstein, the report\nstates.\n\nThe issue in the Epstein\ncase is not whether females\ncame to his waterfront home,\nbut whether he knew fheir\nages,\n\n“He’s never denied girls\ncame to the house,” Gold-\nberger said. But when Ep\nstein was given a polygraph\n\ntest, “he passed on knowl-\nedge of age,” the attorney\nsaid.\n\nAfter the indictment\nagainst Epstein was unsealed\nthis week, Police Chief Reiter\nreferred the matter to the\nFBI. “We've received the re-\nferral, and we're reviewing\nit,” said FBI spokeswoman\nJudy Orihuela in Miami.\n\nThe chief himself has\ncome under attack from Ep-\nstein’s lawyers and friends in\nNew York, where he has a\nhome, The New York Post\nquoted Epstein’s prominent\nNew York lawyer, Gerald\nLefcourt, as saying his client\nwas indicted only “because of\nthe craziness of the police\nchief.”\n\nReiter has declined to\ncomment on the case. ,\n\nProsecutors have not\npresented a sex-related case\nlike Epstein’s to a grand jury\nbefore, said Mike Edmond-\nson, spokesman for the state\nattomey’s office. “That's what\nyou do with a case that falls\ninto a gray area,” he said.\n\nThe state attorney's office\ndid not recommend a partic-\nular criminal charge on\nwhich to indict Epstein, Ed-\nmondson said. The grand ju-\nry was presented with a list of\ncharges from highest to low-\nest, then deliberated with the\nprosecutor out of the room,\nhe said.\n\n“People are surprised at\nthe grand jury proceeding,”\nWest Palm Beach defense\nattorney Richard Tendler\n\nsaid. “It’s a way for the pros-\necutor’s office to not take the\nfull responsibility for not fil-\ning the (charge), and not do-\ning what the Palm Beach Po-\nlice Department wanted. I\nthink something fell apart\nwith those underage wit-\nnesses.”\n\nDefense attorney Robert\nGershman was a prosecutor\nfor six years. “Those girls\nmust have been incredible or\nuntrustworthy, I don’t know,”\nhe said.\n\nOther attorneys said Ep\nstein’s case raises the issue of\nwhether wealthy, connected\ndefendants like Epstein ~\nwhose friends include former\nPresident Clinton and\nDonald Trump + are treated\ndifferently from others. Once\nhe knew he was the subject of\na criminal probe, Epstein\nhired a phalanx of powerful\nattorneys such as Dershowitz\nand Lefcourt, who is a past\npresident of the National As-\nsociation of Criminal Defense\nLawyers.\n\nMiami lawyer Roy Black\n— who became nationally\nknown when he successfully\ndefended William Kennedy\nSmith on a rape charge in\nPalm Beach — also was in-\nvolved at one point.\n\nSaid defense attorney\nMichelle Suskauer: “I think\nits unfortunate the public\nmay get the perception that\nwith power, you may be\ntreated differently than the\naverage Joe,”\n\n© lany_keller@pbpost.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019368\n\n4\na\na\n\n03956-68",
