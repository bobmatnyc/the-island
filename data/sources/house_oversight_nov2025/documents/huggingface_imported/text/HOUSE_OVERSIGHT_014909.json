Instagram feedback was notably positive,\nwith many suggesting the demand is additive (not reallocation from core Facebook).\n\nEstimates vs Consensus\n\nOur 1Q17 and 2Q17 revenue and EBITDA estimates are ahead above the Street. We\nassume ~800bps of advertising growth deceleration in 3Q and another ~400bps in 4Q,\nand our 2017 estimates are also slightly above consensus. On that premise, we are\ncomfortable that Street estimates sufficiently reflect potential impact of News Feed ad\nload deceleration in 2H17.\n\nTable 15: Facebook Estimate Summary\n\n1017 2017 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofA ML est. $7,905 $9,303 $38,546 $48,882\nGrowth Y/Y% 47% 45% 39% 27%\nStreet $7,798 $8,993 $37,774 $48,103\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\nEBITDA\nBofA ML est. $4,886 $5,844 $24,358 $30,905\nStreet $4,743 $5,638 $23,775 $30,409\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\nEPS\nBofA ML est. 1.14 $1.37 $5.67 $7.01\nStreet 1.11 $1.30 $5.43 $6.75\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\nGAAP EPS\nBofA ML est. 0.94 $1.17 $4.86 $6.02\nStreet 0.86 $1.06 $4.45 $5.76\nBofA ML vs Street Above Above Above Above\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\n\nOur $165 price objective is based on 24x our non-GAAP 2018E EPS and 27x GAAP EPS,\nmultiples equal to about 1x 2018E revenue growth, mostly in-line with its social and\nonline media peers.
