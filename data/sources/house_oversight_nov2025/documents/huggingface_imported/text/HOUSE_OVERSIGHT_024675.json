Production services companies that invest in the necessary equip-\nment and facilities should see strong demand for high-margin specialized services from cultivators\nand other production intermediaries. We expect opportunities will expand for companies that provide\nextraction services (particularly those who professionally manage hazardous processes such as hydro-\ncarbon extraction) or develop proprietary infused-product manufacturing processes.\n\nEnergy-efficient, Integrated Cultivation Components. We anticipate continued design and con-\nstruction of sophisticated indoor cultivation facilities, which should present a significant opportunity\nfor suppliers of advanced cultivation components that improve yield and reduce energy costs. We\nbelieve companies that provide all-in-one integrated systems for automation, monitoring and control\nof the production process are more likely to succeed than companies that merely offer a single-point\nsolution.\n\nBranded Laboratory Test Certification. Given the importance of product testing, we believe that\nleading providers of high-quality testing services have an opportunity to establish an industry recog-\nnized “certification,” and that such a certification may become a key factor in influencing consumer\nconfidence and demand.\n\nEfficiencies in Cannabis Cultivation. We believe that certain segments of the market will become\nincreasingly commoditized and that cultivators with low production costs and high yields will have\nsignificant competitive advantage. Cultivators with operations in regions conducive to low-cost nat-\nural production should benefit as laws are changed to facilitate interstate and international cannabis\ncommerce.\n\nProduction Challenges\n\nChallenges in this segment include:\n\nScaling Cultivation Operations. Current laws typically force cultivators to build, and obtain licenses\nfor, potentially redundant, capital-intensive cultivation facilities in each jurisdiction they serve. The\ncapital requirements and uncertainty around licensing present serious challenges to cultivators seeking\nto scale their operations.\n\nDownward-pricing Pressure on Cannabis Flower. Cannabis wholesale prices are declining as large-\nscale cultivators begin to commoditize cannabis flower. Small and inefficient cultivators (including\nhigh-cost indoor producers) may struggle to produce cannabis at effective margins as cannabis cultiva-\ntion migrates to global regions with conditions that support low-cost, sustainable production.\n\nLack of Standardized Testing. Currently, it may be difficult or impossible to reliably compare test\nresults between providers of testing services because the cannabis industry has not yet developed uni-\nform testing standards. Until the industry adopts uniform standards that address testing procedures\nand. reporting for a broad variety of flower, concentrates and infused products, providers of testing\nservices may struggle to develop an industry-wide brand and reputation for quality.\n\nAccess to Capital. Participants in this segment generally engage in capital-intensive operations.\nIn particular, cultivation, contract manufacturing and testing facilities require significant capital\ninvestment. Emerging companies in this segment may struggle to raise sufficient capital to compete\neffectively.\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 39\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024675",
