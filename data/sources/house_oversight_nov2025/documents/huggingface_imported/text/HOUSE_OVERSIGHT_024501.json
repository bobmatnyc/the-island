According to Harris Nesbitt Research, industry experts estimate that the $21.8\nbillion in revenues generated by for-profit education providers in 2004 will increase to over $29.7 billion in\n2010, 5.3% annual growth. 7° However, these estimates reflect only spending by institutions on\neducational material and do not reflect the growing segment of direct to consumer educational materials,\nwhich represented roughly an additional $20 billion in 2004.\n\nFor-Profit K-12 Education (2004 — 2010E\n\n$30\n$25\n$20\n$15\n$10\n\n$5\n\n$0\n\n(in billions)\n\n2004 2005 2006E 2007E 2008E 2009E 2010E\n\n= Professional Development & Print Publishing © Supplemental Services © Technology = Assessment = School Management\n\nSource: Harris Nesbitt estinates based on Eduventures’ “The Education Industry: Learning Markets and Opportunities 2004”\nreport (December 2004).\n\nStandards and Accountability. Due to the unsatisfactory performance of American students in grades K-\n12, parents and lawmakers are demanding increased standards and accountability in schools. This\ndemand has focused on establishing guidelines for every school and every subgroup of students and\nthen holding the school (and its staff) accountable to students’ performance relative to those standards.\nThe Company expects continued focus on academic standards, assessments, and accountability in the\nnear future. Despite this increased attention on standards and accountability, many parents continue to\nremain concerned with the overall effectiveness of the public school system and are increasingly relying\non for-profit education providers.\n\nCharter Schools and Virtual Academies. There has also been a significant rise in the number of charter\nschools in the U.S. in the past decade. Since Minnesota first enacted legislation in 1991, 40 states and\nthe District of Columbia have passed charter school legislation. Under the typical charter school statute,\nan identified entity, such as the state, a state university or local school district board of education, is\nauthorized to grant a specified number of charters to community groups or non-profit entities to create a\npublic charter school. A growing number of charter boards, in turn, contract with private sector\norganizations to manage the schools. In return for a large measure of autonomy from normal public\nschool regulation, the charter school is accountable for student academic performance. Currently, the\nCompany estimates that there were nearly 2,700 charter schools in operation nationwide, as of January\n2003, with an estimated enrollment of over 685,000 students. Moreover, the federal No Child Left Behind\nAct (“NCLB”) recognizes charter schools as a viable alternative for students who want to transfer from\nneighborhood schools that are failing.\n\nTo capitalize upon the increasing number of parents who are willing to educate their children at home and\nstill want to be part of the public system, there are a growing number of virtual schools, where much of\nthe learning is home-based. Most current charter school legislation either explicitly authorizes virtual\npublic schools or does not directly prohibit them. Because virtual schools usually offer a comprehensive\ncurriculum, easy-to-use learning and performance evaluation technology assistance and instructional\nmaterials, the Company believes that a growing number of families will pursue virtual public schools as an\nattractive alternative to traditional schools and a more cost-effective, better organized approach to home\nschooling. The large and scalable platform that exists at k12 is designed to capitalize on this trend as the\nnumber of charter schools has grown on average nearly 13% annually, while charter school enrollment\n\n*8 Source: Harris Nesbitt, Education and Training, September 2005.\n\n68\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024501",
