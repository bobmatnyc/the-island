Hi Jeff

About time for our actions to turn into theatre and movie pieces.
Shall we talk? Any news from BC/AdR?

Hi Jeff

I'm in Serengeti, Tanzania

No real communication. Cannot open the NYT article. But to judge from the article's title they are at least
exaggerating if not totally wrong. This attack will not change strategy in a major way on either side. It will
however raise respect for DJT in Moscow and few other capitals. That's not necessarily bad, if the WH won't
read this change as a precedent which calls to be repeated too often.
