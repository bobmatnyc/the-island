  "text": "In the early years of the Iranian Revolution, an obscure cleric named Ayatollah Gilani\nbecame a sensation on state television by contemplating bizarre hypotheticals at the\nintersection of Islamic law and sexuality. One of his most outlandish scenarios -- still\n\nmocked by Iranians three decades later -- went like this:\n\nImagine you are a young man sleeping in your bedroom. In the bedroom directly below,\nyour aunt lies asleep. Now imagine that an earthquake happens that collapses your floor,\ncausing you to fall directly on top of her. For the sake of argument, let's assume that you're\nboth nude, and you're erect, and you land with such perfect precision on top of her that\nyou unintentionally achieve intercourse. Is the child of such an\n\nencounter halalzadeh (legitimate) or haramzadeh (a bastard)?\n\nSuch tales of random ribaldry may sound anomalous in the seemingly austere, asexual\nIslamic Republic of Iran. But the \"Gili Show,\" as it came to be known, had quite the\nfollowing among both the traditional classes, who were titillated by his taboo topics, and\nthe Tehrani elite, who tuned in for comic relief. Gilani helped spawn what is now a virtual\ncottage industry of clerics and fundamentalists turned amateur sexologists offering\nincoherent advice on everything from quickies (\"The man’s goal should be to lighten his\nload as soon as possible without arousing his woman\") to masturbation (\"a grave, grave\n\nsin which causes scientific and medical harm\").\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026552",
