In\nthis scenario, China replaces the US and the global hegemonic power\nsooner or later. As we study these America-is-finished-and-China-\nrules-the-world forecasts, it is important to recall that not so long ago\nmany of the same pundits and futurologists were anticipating that\nglobalisation and the Internet would lead to the collapse of the nation-\nstate and the end of the business cycle, or that the US would\ndominate a unipolar international system and bring about the triumph\nof democracy and free markets worldwide.\n\nThat many of the same experts who were celebrating US\ntriumphalism in the aftermath of the fall of the Berlin Wall and the\nFirst Gulf War have now been transformed into the prophets of\nAmerican gloom and doom, should encourage us to embrace a certain\nsense of scepticism about the notion that China and the rest of the\nRest are about to take charge and that Washington will turn out to be\nnothing more than a tourist attraction for Chinese and Indian tourists\nin the coming years.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029947",
