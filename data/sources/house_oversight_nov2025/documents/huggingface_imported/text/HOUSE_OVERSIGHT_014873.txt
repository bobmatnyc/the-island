Hess Corp.
Inflection point: adding Hess to BofAML’s

US 1 ‘best ideas’ list

Reiterate Rating: BUY | PO: 80.00 USD | Price: 49.97 USD

Short interest ratio: catalyst for recovery

Over the past six months Hess has been one of the most volatile stocks in the sector, facing
headwinds from a significant increase in short interest that has exaggerated volatility. From
discussions with investors, the arguments against Hess seem to begin and end with a
combination of declining production and an expanding balance sheet — all part of the
deliberate portfolio choices that favored completing major projects at the expense of short
cycle production. We expect this to end in 2Q17 with a rebound in oil and gas production
starting in 2H17 and critically, an inflection in free cash flow that we expect will return Hess
to free cash flow with the flexibility to re-up investment in the Bakken. We thus would view
Hess as a dangerous ‘short’ for investors seeking to hedge other portfolio risks.

Inflection point on multiple levels right around the corner

We believe Hess’ investment case is approaching an inflection point on multiple levels.
We expect oil and gas production to trough in 2Q17, with a rebound of 60,000 boepd or
22%, by 4Q17 marking the single biggest sequential change in production of any
company in the sector. This is likely to kickstart an extended period of growth in
2018/19 but with the contribution from Guyana driving a step change in Hess’ growth
trajectory through 2025. Near term, we think Hess is also poised for an inflection in free
cash flow that is reasonably $1bn annualized, with $700mm irrespective of oil prices.
Versus consensus operating cash flow of ~$1.9bn in 2017, this stands out as the biggest
swing in free cash of any company in the sector.

Adding Hess to US 1 ‘best ideas’ list

After a year of waiting, we believe the inflection point in Hess’ investment case is just around
the corner, with the broader sector pullback positioning the shares with amongst the highest
upside in the sector as implied by our price objectives. At current levels, Hess ‘discounts’ strip
oil prices. Under our base case, which assumes a rebound in oil prices towards $70 from 2020
fair value is reasonably ~$80 per share. If non-producing asset value from Guyana is included
we estimate this would be closer to $90. BofAML’s US1 list is a collection of the firm’s best
investment ideas managed with the goal of providing superior investment performance over
the long term. For Hess, we believe the combination of catalysts, short interest and absolute
value can drive a period of strong relative outperformance vs peers. For this reason, Hess
replaces DVN as the energy stock on BofAML’s US 1 list.
