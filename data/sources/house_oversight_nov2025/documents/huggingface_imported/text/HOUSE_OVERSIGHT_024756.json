As shown in the chart, the stock price performance of cannabis-\nrelated companies trading on Canadian markets received a boost from the announcement of the pro-\nposed recreational cannabis legislation in Canada by Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and, more recently,\nfrom Constellation Brands investment in Canopy Growth. Similarly, the continuing positive price per-\nformance of cannabis-related companies trading on U.S. markets has not been slowed by the election of\nDonald Trump as President and the selection of Jeff Sessions as Attorney General of the United States\n(two events that were viewed by many as potentially having a negative impact on the U.S. cannabis\n\nindustry).\nGlobal Cannabis Stock Price Performance\n1500%\n1300%\n1100% Canadian Prime Minister\n° ' announces plans to\nSessions confirmed legalize recreational\n900% as U.S. Attorney cannabis Constellation Brands’\n\nGeneral investment in\n700% Canopy Growth\n\nTrump\né elected as\nae U.S. President\n\n300%\n\n100%\n\n-100%\n\nSep 16 Nov 16 Jan 17 Mar 17 May 17 Jul 17 Sep 17 Nov 17\n—— S&P 500 Nasdaq/NYSE Cannabis Index —— OTC Cannabis Index\n—— TSX/TSXV Cannabis Index —— CSE Cannabis Index —— ASX Cannabis Index\n\nSource: S&P Global Market Intelligence\n\nCapital Raised by Publicly Traded Cannabis-Related Companies\n\nThe following table shows the amount of capital (equity and debt) raised by cannabis-related compa-\nnies traded on the U.S., Canadian and Australian stock markets in the twelve months ended Septem-\nber 30, 2017. While more than $1.3 billion was raised, the data indicates that relatively few companies\nwere able to raise capital, given the aggregate number of publicly traded cannabis-related companies,\nand the amount raised per transaction was small, supporting the assertion that the market is still driven\nprimarily by retail investors.\n\n120 © 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024756",
