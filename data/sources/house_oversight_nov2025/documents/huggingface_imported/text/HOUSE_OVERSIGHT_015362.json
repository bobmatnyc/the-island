  "text": "Lenny was writing an autobiography--How to Talk Dirty and\nInfluence People--which Playboy planned to serialize, then publish as a\nbook, and they hired me as his editor. We met in Atlantic City, where he\nwas taking Delaudid for lethargy, and he sent a telegram to a contact, with\na phrase--DE LAWD IN DE SKY--as a code to send a doctor's prescription.\n\nAt a certain point he was acting paranoid and demanded that | take\na lie-detector test, and | was paranoid enough to take him literally. |\ncouldn't work with him if he didn't trust me. We got into an argument, and\n| left.\n\nHe sent a telegram that sounded like we were on the verge of\ndivorce. “WHY CAN'T IT BE THE WAY IT USED TO BE?” he wrote. | agreed\nto try again, and in 1962 | flew to Chicago. Lenny was performing at the\nGate of Horn, where he was asking the whole audience to take a lie-\ndetector test.\n\nLenny was intrigued by the implications of an item in 7he Realist, an\nactual statement by Adolf Eichmann that he would have been “not only a\nscoundrel, but a despicable pig” if he hadn't carried out Hitler's orders.\nLenny wrote a piece for 7he Realist “Letter From a Soldier's Wife,”\nnamely Mrs. Eichmann pleading for compassion to spare her husband's\n\nlife.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015362",
