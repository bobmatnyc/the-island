Three US universities have developed campuses in China (Johns\nHopkins, Duke, NYU), more than one hundred universities participate in cooperative-\neducation programs in China, and countless US faculty members participate in\ncollaborative projects with Chinese colleagues (principally in the sciences). These\nrelationships have not been easy to establish or maintain, but they have generally\nbeen successful. A 2016 report by the Government Accounting Office, which reviewed\nthe cooperative programs of twelve American universities, found that the universities\n“generally indicated that they experienced academic freedom,” while noting that\n\nself- and internet censorship remains a problem.\n\nIn recent years, the outlook for these collaborations has deteriorated in line with\nbroader restrictions on academic freedom on Chinese campuses. In 2013, and\ncommensurate with CCP Central Committee Document No. 9, universities were\nreportedly instructed to avoid discussing topics including “universal values” and civil\nrights,?” and admonitions against teaching of Western values have continued. Since\n2017, foreign university collaborative institutions have been required to institute\nCommunist Party committees and place a Party secretary on their management\nboards.*8 In July 2018, the Ministry of Education ended 234, or one-fifth, of its\ninternational university partnerships. More than twenty-five programs with\nAmerican universities were among them.”\n\nThe Chinese government has demonstrated a penchant for turning to these\ncollaborations as points of leverage when US universities have hosted the Dalai\n\nLama or held other events deemed politically sensitive or offensive to the Chinese\ngovernment. In such instances, existing collaborative exchange programs have been\nsuspended or put on hold, planned visits of university administrators have been\ncanceled, programs between university institutes and centers have been suspended,\nand Chinese students wishing to study at these US institutions have been counseled\nto go elsewhere. Such punitive actions resulting from campus visits by the Dalai Lama\nhave been taken against Emory University, the University of Maryland, the University\nof California-San Diego, and others. In the case of the University of Maryland, which\nhosted the Dalai Lama in 2013, there was temporary fallout, and then following the\n2017 graduation incident the Chinese government again halted cooperation, seriously\ndamaging one of the most extensive exchange programs with China.\n\nSection 4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020506",
