  "text": "The Elusiveness of Meaningful\nConnection\n\nKathryn Tanner’s chapter has\ndeveloped the classical Christian idea\nthat God is the creator and sustainer of\nthe world, in order to suggest the ways\nin which this notion of the creator might\nbe one factor providing persons with a\nsense of social connection and a hopeful,\ngenerous, and caring disposition toward\nthe world that assuages the adverse\nhealth consequences of loneliness. In\nthis classic interpretation of God as\ncreator, the idea refers not to the origins\nof the universe but rather to the all-\ninclusive dependence of life upon God at\nall times. This sense of a sustaining\ndivine presence spanning the whole time\nof one’s life thus contributes a deep\nsense of one’s connection to the whole\norder of creation. However, as Tanner\nnotes, people may become inattentive to\na presence so pervasive, just as people\ncan become inattentive to the forces of\ngravity holding them to the surface of\nthe Earth as they go about their everyday\nlife. In more extreme versions of this\ninattention, the person understands\nhumanity as “alone” in the universe, a\nsort of metaphysical loneliness that\nmight exacerbate more concrete feelings\nof loneliness.\n\nPerhaps surprisingly, Chris Masi,\nfrom the perspective of a physician and\nmedical researcher, casts a fascinating\nand fresh perspective on the theological\nnotion that we live in a sustaining\nconnection to creation as a whole. After\ndescribing the negative health\nconsequences of loneliness, Masi\nproceeds to describe a cycle of\nloneliness in which a person’s sense of\nisolation frustrates well-intended efforts\nto make social connections. Masi finds\nthat efforts to intervene and break this\n\nPage |129\n\ncycle are not notably successful, in large\npart because the preconscious\ndisposition of lonely people toward the\nworld is difficult to change. Like Tanner,\nalthough using different terminology,\nMasi’s review of the scientific literature\nsuggests both that the character of one’s\ngeneral disposition toward the world is\nprofoundly important for one’s\nconnections to others, and that the\nprocesses by which these general\ndispositions change are complex and\nwarrant further scientific attention.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021375",
