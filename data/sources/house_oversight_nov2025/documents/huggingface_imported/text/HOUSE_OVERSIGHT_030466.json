  "text": "In fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful\npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl\nissues, and moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You\ndon’t tend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett\ndidn’t quite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he\nhas been open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her\nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she'll be out and about as always. Look\nat Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up for\nall sorts of blemishes.\n\nBS Df DIS 2S DIS Ig OIC BIS DIS 2S ik DIS IC 24C BIS DIS 54S 2k DIS ig DIC BIS DIS DIC 2k DIC Ig 24S BIC DIS 3S DC DIC Ok DIC BIS DIC SIC 2g DIC 2g 24C IS OIC 51S Df DIC 2k 24K IS 2IK 2S 2fe DIC 2k OIC Ik 2k 2k\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
