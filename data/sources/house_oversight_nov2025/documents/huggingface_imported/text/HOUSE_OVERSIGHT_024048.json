  "text": "development stage companies as an important source of innovation and new products to\nsupplement R&D pipelines and drive future growth. Strong growth potential is critical for\nthese companies to support their valuation metrics, especially in light of expected patent\nexpirations on their commercial products. In total, over $290 billion of revenue is at risk from\npatent expirations between now and 2018.29 The large and mid-sized companies are addressing\nthis strategic need to a large extent through increased acquisitions and partnerships with\ndevelopment stage companies that have maturing assets. The Fund Managers expect this\ndynamic to increase competition between the larger strategic players in the industry as they vie\nfor the most interesting companies with maturing development stage assets. The development\nstage companies should have strong negotiating leverage in these deal discussions, which\nshould drive premium valuations on acquisitions and attractive terms on partnerships.\n\nThe increased strategic need for acquisitions and partnerships comes at a time when the large\nand many of the mid-sized companies in the industry are in a strong financial position to\ncomplete high value deals. The top ten pharmaceutical companies have a total of $140 billion in\ncash on their balance sheets today and have a combined market capitalization of over $1.3\ntrillion.*° A relatively new set of well funded potential acquirers and/or partners has emerged\nover the last decade, as many of the mid-sized biotech companies have seen their commercial\nbusinesses thrive, and now have strong revenue and profit growth. Since 2002, the number of\npublic biotech companies with annual profit (EBIT) over $100 million has doubled to 16, and the\ncombined annual profit of these companies has increased 4.5 times to $16.6 billion.*!_ This has\nsignificantly increased the number of companies in the industry with the financial wherewithal\nto complete large cash transactions. At the same time, the industry’s R&D productivity has\nbeen disappointing in terms of new products generated by massive internal R&D budgets. To\naddress the gaps created in their R&D pipelines, most large and mid-sized players have shifted\na large percentage of their R&D budgets away from internal R&D projects and have increased\ninvestment in “externalizing” a large portion of their R&D. These companies have slashed\ninternal R&D budgets, closed major R&D facilities, and made large cuts to headcount. It is\nestimated that the pharmaceutical industry cut R&D spending by 5.7% in the U.S. and 2.2%\nglobally in 2012 alone,*? and this trend has continued in 2013. Most large and mid-sized\nbiopharmaceutical companies now have large internal groups that include a combination of\nbusiness and scientific resources that are dedicated exclusively to external search and\nevaluation, and are tasked with finding opportunities for mergers, acquisitions, and\npartnerships that will bring in new technology. Some have taken this strategy even further and\nhave set up their own internal venture capital investment groups with the belief that by co-\ninvesting with more experienced institutional venture investors they can improve their\nvisibility into the latest innovations and improved access to the best opportunities. The Fund\nManagers believe that this combination of financial strength and strategic need to source more\nproducts than internal R&D efforts can produce will lead to a significant increase in deal\nactivity, creating a strong exit environment for smaller development stage companies for the\nforeseeable future.\n\n29 eValuatePharma\n3° Burrill Biotech 2012 Report\n\n\" New Leaf Analysis of public company financial data as provided by Bloomberg\n» Battelle R&D Magazine Annual Global R&D Funding Forecast\n\n37 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024048",
