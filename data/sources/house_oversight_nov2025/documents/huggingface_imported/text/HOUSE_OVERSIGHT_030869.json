FOLLOW RAW STORY!\n\nAfter just three weeks on the job, President Donald Trump is reportedly frustrated with the realities of trying to\nrun the U.S. government the way he manages his family-owned business.\n\nPolitico interviewed nearly two dozen people who have spent time with the former real estate developer and\nreality TV star since his inauguration — and they said Trump’s “mood has careened between surprise and anger\nas he’s faced the predictable realities of governing,” according to the report.\n\n“The interviews paint a picture of a powder-keg of a workplace where job duties are unclear, morale among\nsome is low, factionalism is rampant and exhaustion is running high,” Politico reported. ‘““Two visitors to the\nWhite House last week said they were struck by how tired the staff looks.”\n\nTrump would like to shake up his White House staff less than a month into the job but knows it’s too soon, the\nwebsite reported, and aides joke that the president would like to spend even more time golfing at his Mar-A-\n\nLago resort.\n\nSources close to Trump said he’s infuriated by the profusion of leaks revealing his confrontational phone calls\nwith world leaders and the herky-jerky inner workings of the White House.\n\nThe White House has launched an investigation of those leaks that appears to be focused on the National\nSecurity Council, based on the Politico report.\n\nNSC staffers have been instructed to cooperate with the inquiry, and the administration may tighten the inner\ncircle of aides who have access to the calls and their transcripts, the website reported.\n\nA culture of fear and paranoia is developing, pitting the president and his allies against career NSC staff\nassigned from other agencies.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030869",
