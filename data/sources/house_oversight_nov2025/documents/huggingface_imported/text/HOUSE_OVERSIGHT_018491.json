  "text": "[theory] Body Chemistry and S&M\n\nThis was originally published in 2011. I don't normally write basic \"how-to\" posts like\nthis, but every once in a while I see a gap I just have to fill.\n\n*\n\nBody Chemistry and S&M\n\nI often think that good physical health is a widely-ignored element of good sex. I am\nobviously not saying that people in poor health can't have good sex (and in fact, I\ncertainly hope they do -- more power to 'em). But it consistently amazes me how much\nmy physical health factors into my sexuality, especially S&M. I am by no means an\nexpert on this topic, but here are some examples:\n\n* Food. I am both less interested in sex and in S&M when I'm hungry; ensuring that I've\neaten well before I take some punishment is especially crucial. I try to eat well in general,\nbut if I'm planning to have a heavy S&M encounter, I don't cut myself any slack. I try to\nspecifically ensure that I eat enough protein before the date and I try to include some\nvitamin-heavy foods like beets, leafy green vegetables, etc. Eggs are a good source of\nprotein; nuts, beans and tofu are my primary protein sources. If I don't have enough\nprotein available for whatever reason, I at least eat enough food that I won't be hungry\nwhen I see my partner.\n\nPart of the reason I'm writing this right now is that I've had trouble finding useful\nresources on the Internet for what people recommend as good pre- or post-S&M food,\nespecially during aftercare. \"Aftercare\" is an S&M term for how people end their S&M\nencounters. One excellent page on aftercare describes it thusly:\n\nAftercare is the last act of the SM drama. It is the culmination, the pulling together of all\nloose ends, the finishing touches, the final communion between sharers of the SM ritual,\nthe phase where the participants (usually the tops) formally give the fantasy scene a\ncontext in everyday reality. Its technical purpose is to transition both players from the\nelevated states created in a scene [i.e., an S&M encounter] back into normalcy,\nreturning to the motor control and awareness they will need to drive home once the\nscene is over. But as any good SM practitioner will tell you, it's much more than that. It\nis the time after the action when the participants come together in mutual affirmation\nthat something special was created and shared. It is when affection and closeness is\noffered and sought. It is, at very least, the proper time to express thanks to the person\nwho has shared this tiny segment of your life with you. It can be, and often is, the most\nbeautiful part of a scene, and it is part of the scene. To skip it altogether is as rude as\nhaving dinner at a friend's house and then bolting once you've eaten your fill.\n\nA lot of tops keep food and water on hand to give bottoms at the end of a scene, which I\nthink is probably a good idea. (Eating post-scene doesn't feel necessary for me as a\nbottom, but it might if I weren't so careful about what I eat beforehand.) Some people say\nthat fruit or fruit juice is the way to go -- and indeed, it will give the bottom's system a\nsugar boost and may make them feel better for that reason -- but I would personally rather\neat a protein bar, and I have some friends who feel the same way. Dungeons usually serve\nsnacks, although the snacks aren't always very healthy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018491",
