  "text": "designer to craft a spindly “male” apparatus of hinges and rods, set up to communicate\nwith bulbous “female” fiberglass entities nearby. Whether anyone could actually map the\nquiddities of the program (or glean its reactionary gender theater) without reading the\ncatalog essay is an open question. What is significant is Pask’s focus on the behaviors of\nhis automata, their interactivity, their responsiveness within an artificially modulated\nenvironment, and their “reflection” of human behaviors.\n\nThe ICA’s “Cybernetic Serendipity” introduced an important paradigm: the\nmachinic ecosystem, in which the viewer was a biological part, tasked with figuring out\njust what the triggers for interaction might be. The visitors in those London galleries\nsuddenly became “cybernetic organisms’”—cyborgs—since to experience the art\nadequately, one needed to enter a kind of symbiotic colloquy with the servomechanisms.\nThis turn toward human-machine interactive environments as an aesthetic becomes\nclearer when we examine a few other artworks from the period, beginning with one\nconstituting an early instance of emergent behavior—Senster, the interactive sculpture by\nartist/engineer Edward Ihnatowicz (1970), celebrated by medical robotics engineer Alex\nZivanovic, editor of a Web site devoted to Ihnatowicz’s little-known career, as “one of\nthe first computer controlled interactive robotic works of art.” Here, “the computer”\nmakes its entry (albeit a twelve-bit, limited device). But rather than “intelligence,”\nThnatowicz sought to make an avatar of affective behavior. Key to Senster ’s uncanny\nsuccess was the programming with which Ihnatowicz constrained the fifteen-foot-long\nhydraulic apparatus (its hinge design and looming appearance inspired by a lobster claw)\nto convey shyness in responding to humans in its proximity. Sensfer’s sound channels\nand motion sensors were set to recoil at loud noises and sudden aggressive movements.\nOnly those humans willing to speak softly and modulate their gestures would be\nrewarded by Senster’s quiet, inquisitive approach—an experience that became real for\nThnatowicz himself when he first assembled the program and the machine turned to him\nsolicitously after he’d cleared his throat.\n\nIn these artistic uses of cybernetic beings, we sense a growing necessity to train\nthe public to experience itself as embedded in a technologized environment, modifying\nitself to communicate intuitively with machines. This necessity had already become\nexplicit in Tsai’s “Cybernetic Sculpture” show. Those experiencing his immersive\ninstallation were expected to experiment with machinic life: What behaviors would\ntrigger the servomechanisms? Likely, the human gallery attendant would have had to\nexplain the protocol: “Clap your hands—that gets the sculptures to respond.” As an early\ncritic described it:\n\nA grove of slender stainless-steel rods rises from a plate. This base vibrates at 30\ncycles per second; the rods flex rapidly, in harmonic curves. Set in a dark room,\nthey are lit by strobes. The pulse of the flashing lights varies—they are\nconnected to sound and proximity sensors. The result is that when one\napproaches a Tsai or makes a noise in its vicinity, the thing responds. The rods\nappear to move; there is a shimmering, a flashing, an eerie ballet of metal, whose\napparent movements range from stillness to jittering and back to a slow,\nindescribably sensuous undulation.”\n\n“° Robert Hughes, Zime magazine (October 2, 1972) review of Tsai exhibition at Denise René gallery.\n\n176\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016396",
