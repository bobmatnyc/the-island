L. & Criminology 59, *89\n\nCVRA protections - i.e., victims of misdemeanor offenses prosecuted by way of complaint - will never have proper venue to\nassert those rights because, according to OLC's strained argument, no prosecution ever started in their cases.\n\nEven limiting the focus to felony cases, OLC misleadingly describes the Sixth Amendment case law. It is not immediately\nclear why one would look to the right to counsel to determine the breadth of the term \"prosecution\" in the Sixth Amendment.\nThe right to counsel is not the only right found in that Amendment. The Amendment also extends, for example, a right to a\nspeedy trial in all criminal \"prosecutions.\" !’* The case law on the speedy trial right makes clear that the right \"may attach\nbefore an indictment and as early as the time of arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge.\" 174\n\nIn any event, the right to counsel cases are quite clear in providing that a Sixth Amendment \"prosecution\" can (and often does)\nbegin well before an indictment. !’4 The Supreme Court has directly held that the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel attaches\n\"at or after the time that judicial proceedings have been initiated against [a person] - \"whether by way of formal charge,\npreliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment.\" !7° Thus, under this controlling precedent, some earlier point in\ntime before indictment is the triggering point of a Sixth Amendment \"prosecution.\"\n\nThe cases that OLC cites are not to the contrary. It is true that some federal appeals courts have stated that the mere filing of a\ncriminal complaint does not trigger a Sixth Amendment right to counsel. '’° But there is a split of authority on this question,\nas OLC acknowledges in a footnote. '77 More importantly for purposes of this Article, the cases holding [*90] that the mere\nfiling of a complaint does not start a Sixth Amendment prosecution also make clear that a later court hearing would start such a\nprosecution. For instance, in the Fourth Circuit case cited by OLC, United States v. Alvarado, the court reasons that \"the main\nreason a law enforcement officer files [] a complaint is to establish probable cause for an arrest warrant. The criminal process is\nstill in the investigative stage, and the adverse positions of government and defendant have yet to solidify.\" !78 Relying on that\nreasoning, the Fourth Circuit refused to find that the right to counsel had attached merely because a police officer had filed a\ncomplaint to get an arrest warrant. But the Fourth Circuit distinguished that situation from \"the initiation of adversary judicial\nproceedings against the defendant.\" '7? An initial appearance would be such an adversary proceeding - i.e., it would be a\n\"prosecution\" under the Sixth Amendment. In light of this, OLC's position that the CVRA's venue provision's \"no-prosecution-\nunderway\" reference covers proceedings, such as an initial appearance, does not work.\n\nThe only sensible way to construe the CVRA's venue provision is to read it as conveniently dividing criminal cases into two\nphases: a prosecution phase and an earlier investigative phase when \"no prosecution is under way.\" !8° Senator Kyl, for\n\n72 U.S. Const. amend.
