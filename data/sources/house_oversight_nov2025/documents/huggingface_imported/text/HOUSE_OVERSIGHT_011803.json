  "text": "/ BARAK / 46\n\nviewed Hafez al-Assad as a natural partner for peace. For years, he’d been a\nconstant, sneering presence on our northern border, denouncing not only Sadat but\nany Arab leader who’d shown willingness to engage or negotiate with Israel. Amos\nOz, one of our finest writers and a cultural icon for Labor Zionists, probably put it\nbest. He said the Syrians seemed to think that “we will give them the Golan, and\ntheyll send us a receipt by fax.” The consensus was: forget Assad. Keep the\nGolan. In fact, before I left for the US, the Knesset voted on whether it supported\nmy attempt to negotiate an agreement with Syria. We could muster only 47 votes,\n14 short of a majority. An opinion poll found only 13 percent of Israelis favored a\nfull withdrawal from the Golan.\n\nThe message I drew from this was not that we should give up on the chances of\na peace agreement. After all, before Begin and Sadat went to Camp David in 1978,\nan almost equally tiny minority of Israelos had been in favor of withdrawing from\nthe Sinai. Yet once they had seen the other side of the equation — full, formal peace\nwith our most powerful neighbor — the opposition all but evaporated. The problem\nI saw was that if we and the Syrians couldn’t find a way to insulate our\nnegotiations from leaks, speculation and a swirl of opposition to our efforts at\nhome, we’d never gef to the key issues of substance.\n\nI’d been making that point to the Americans for weeks. At first, I tried to\npersuade them to hold the talks at Camp David, ensuring the same, media-free\nisolation that had yielded the historic Israeli-Egypt agreement. But Dennis Ross\nreplied that the very association of Camp David with that breakthrough meant it\nwould be a non-starter for President Assad. I then suggested we consider sites\noutside of the US: NATO’s Incerlik air base in Turkey, for instance, a British base\nin Cyprus, an American naval ship in the Mediterranean. Even, half-jokingly, an\nabandoned missile silo in South Dakota. Yet the point I was making was serious, in\nfact critical, I believed, if the talks were going to have a chance.\n\nIn the end, the Americans settled on a beautiful, and undeniably remote, town in\nWest Virginia called Shepherdstown. But from the outset, I was worried it couldn’t\nprovide the kind of environment we needed. As soon as our plane landed at\nAndrews Air Force base outside Washington, I got a call from the head of our\nadvance team. He told me the news media were already there and that reporters —\nIsraeli, Arab, American and European — could be seen chatting with American,\nIsraeli and Syrian officials in the town’s coffee shops. I knew the press would have\nto publish something about potential concessions as the negotiations proceeded.\n\n332\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011803",
