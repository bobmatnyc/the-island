While\nrecognising the significance of Xi as\nthe core was correct, conjuring up\nvisions of an emerging dictator was\nnot.\n\nT recalled my meeting with Xi\nyears earlier, when he wasstill party\nsecretary of Zhejiang (‘#f71) prov-\nince. Even then he was criticising\n“empty talk” and advising, “We\nshould never overestimate our\naccomplishments or indulge our-\nselves in our achievements”.\n\nI took note of how Xi stressed,\n“We need to assess ourselves objec-\ntively”. Hardly, in retrospect, the\nruminations ofa gestating dictator.\n\nTounderstand why Xiis nowthe\ncore, one must appreciate the\ncomplex challenges of our times.\nChina is now facing multiple chal-\nlenges: domestically -slow growth,\nindustrial overcapacity, endemic\npollution, imbalanced develop-\nment, income disparity, social\ninjustice, social service demands;\nand, internationally—wars, regional\nconflicts, sluggish economies, vola-\ntile markets, trade protectionism,\nethnic clashes, terrorism, geopoliti-\ncal rivalries, and territorial disputes\nin the South and East China seas.\n\nMost critically, because China\nmust deepen its reforms to achieve\nits oft-promised goal of a “moder-\nately prosperous society” by 2020,\nthe resistance of entrenched inter-\nest groups must be overcome. More\nthere is what some call a\npervasive “soft resistance” - local\nofficials who do not do their job and\neconomic elites who migrate.\n\nIf reform had been progressing\nsmoothly, then why strengthen\ncentral authority by investing Xi\nwith the status of core leader? Xihas\nencountered obstacles; if there\nwere no obstacles, there would be\nno need fora core leader.\n\nThave been speaking to party\nofficials and theorists about Xi as\ncore leader. In fact, the necessity of\nhaving a leadership core to main-\ntain stability and expedite reform is\nthe first and foremost of what I\nfound to be four factors relating to\nXi's elevation.\n\nAsecond factor is that not only\ndoes Xi have the responsibility for\nChina’s transformation, he is also\naccountable forit. Moreover, he has\nshown courage in confronting and\ndismantling a vast, corrupt system\nof bribery, patronage and illicit\nwealth accretion.\n\nAthird factoris thatXias the core\ndoes not end, and even may not di-\nminish, the cardinal principle of\n\nXi Jinping as\n\ncore leader is\nmore a ratification\nof reality than\nashift of\nfundamentals\n\n§ he pee\n\n“democratic centralism”. The party\nbolsters each of the concepts:\nencouraging the democratic sclici-\ntation of input and feedback from\nmembers, lower-ranked officials,\nand the public; and strengthening\ncentralism through Xi’s leadershi)\nof the principal levers of power (his\npositions as party general secretary,\nhead of state, chairman of the\nCentral Military Commission, and\nhead of the “leading groups” on\nreform, national security and inter-\nnet security)\n\nA fourth factor is that a core is\nrequired to manage the party more\nstrictly and thereby give members\nand the public more confidence.\nWitness Xi’s relentless and unprec-\nedented anti-corruption campaign,\nwhich is altering how government\nofficials and industry managers\nwork and even think. Let no one\nassume that Xi’s battle against\ncorruption has been risk-free.\n\nSignificantly, these four factors\nundergirding Xi as the core leader\nmap onto his overarching political\nframework, his strategic blueprint\ncalled “The Four Comprehensives”\n—a moderately prosperous society,\nreform, rule of law, party discipline.\n\nXi’s core status arises, we're told,\nthrough the collective will of the\nparty and the people. Becoming\nparty core is not an automatic\nconsequence of being general sec-\nretary; a core leader must fit the\ntimes and the status must be\nearned.\n\nSpeaking at a press conference\nfollowing the 18th Central Commit-\ntee's sixth plenum last month,\nHuang Kunming (#!#%), executive\nvice-minister of the committee's\nPublicity Department, said that the\n“central and local departments as\nwell as the military all expressed\ntheir support” for Xi’s position as\nparty core, adding that this decision\n\nwas “based on the valuable experi-\nence of the party and we feel keenly\naboutit”.\n\nHuang explained that “a core is\nneeded to ensure that the party will\nbe the governing party”, describing\nit as significant for upholding the\nCentral Committee’s authority and\nmaintaining the central, unified\nleadership of the party and for its\n“staying true to its mission”.\n\nTherefore, party theorists\nexplain, Xi as core leader is more a\nratification of reality than a shift of\nfundamentals.\n\nWhat does Xi as core mean ina\nhistorical context? It was Deng\nXiaoping (9/7) who introduced\nthe concept when he designated\nJiang Zemin (1) as “core of the\nthird generation” of central leaders,\nbolstering Jiang’s stature following\nhis unexpected appointment as\nparty leader in 1989. At the time,\nChina was facing the dual impedi-\nments of economic stagnation and\nsocial uncertainty at home, and\neconomic quarantine and diplo-\nmatic isolation abroad. As Deng\npointed out: “Any leading group\nshould have a core; a leadership\nwith no core is unreliable.”\n\nOnly then did Deng retrospec-\ntively apply the novel term to Mao\nZedong (84) and to himself, as\ncore of the first and second gener-\nations, respectively. (Of course,\nMao was so utterly dominant that\ncalling him core during his lifetime\nwould have seemed a demotion.\nDeng remained core even when he\nno longer held any official position.)\n\nToday's world is more complex.\nChina faces threats at home and\nabroad. Volatility grows and uncer-\ntainty abounds ~ the Middle East\nand Donald Trump are offered as\nevidence. The need to secure\nChina’s stability is more essential\nthan ever, and thus to strengthen\n\nXi’'s authority is a primary reason,\nI’m told, for designating Xi as core\nleader. Party theorists say China\n“urgently” requires a political nucl-\neus that is sophisticated and\nnuanced, attuned to contemporary\ntimes. Though conditions now\ndiffer from those in 1989, Deng’s\nadmonition rings timelessly true.\n\nHowever, that a core leader is\nneeded now does notmean one will\nalways be needed. When China\nbecomesa fully modernised nation,\nperhaps by mid-century, condi-\ntions may change again.\n\nTrue loyalty is\ntelling leadership\nin private what\none really\nbelieves is in their\nbest interests\n\nThear frequently of the “painful\nlessons of China's century of blood\nand tears” and that for China not to\nhave a tested and authoritative\nleadership core would be “unthink-\nable”, Party inner talk says “Xi\nJinping has passed the test of the\npeople” to be China's political core,\nleadership core, and a core of the\ntimes.\n\nChinese scholars argue that\n“core” is a unique characteristic of\nChinese political theory — however\ninapplicable (even inexplicable) in\nWestern political theory. They call\nWestern concerns that Xi as core\nleader means that “a new emperor\nis born” wildly unfounded, even\nparanoic. In feudal society, the\nemperor ruled unconditionally\n\nwith arbitrary imperial power, and\ninsucha“command-obey’ system,\ngoes the argument, there is simply\nnoneed foracore.\n\nRather, given today’s party polit-\nical structure, the concept ofa core\nboth strengthens cohesion and\nserves to prevent a personality cult,\nnot to promote one. Having a core\nmeans acknowledging that the\nparty system is not the “emperor\nsystem\" —absolute poweris rejected\n—and that the optimum system, at\nleast for the foreseeable future, is a\ncombination of concentrated cen-\ntralism and democratic collective\nleadership.\n\nCorroborating this functional\nbalance, in the communiquéissued\nfollowing the sixth plenum, the\n“collective leadership system” is\nreconfirmed. It states: “The imple-\nmentation of collective leadership\nand personal division oflabouris an\nimportant component of demo-\ncratic centralism and must always\nbeadhered to.” And itstresses: “Any\norganisation or individual shall,\nunder any circumstance, not be\nallowed to violate this system for\nanyreason.” Thethree “any’s” seem\nno accident.\n\nSome analysts see contradic-\ntions. On the one hand, the\ncommuniqué calls for democracy\nand constructive criticism internal-\nly within the party. On the other,\ndisobeying the central leadership is\nforbidden, backed by vigilant\nsupervision and tough discipline.\n\nYet to read these statements as\ncontradictory is to misunderstand\nwhat is happening here. Xi appreci-\nates the complex and arduous tasks\nthat lie ahead. He told me so a\ndecade ago, and it is obviously truer\ntoday than it was then. The state-\nments are harmonised, first, by the\nparty's motivation toseekoptimum\npeices forthecountry, and second,\n\ny keeping most of the divergent\nviews internal.\n\nTrue loyalty is telling leadership\nin private what one really believes is\nin their bestinterests, not pandering\nand fawning by repeating what one\nthinks leadership wants to hear.\nThough there are concerns, no one\nhere worries that Xi will become\nMao.\n\nChina is now the world’s largest\ntrading nation and its second-larg-\nest economy. China's diplomacy is\nexpanding and its military is grow-\ning. Fromits Belt and Road initiative\nbuilding infrastructure and facili-\ntating trade in over 60 developing\ncountries to its leading role in the\nUN peacekeeping forces, China, the\n“Middle Kingdom’, is involved in\nevery meaningful matter of interna-\ntional affairs.\n\nSo, what kind of China do we\nwant? Certainly not one with weak\ncentral leadership and fragmented\ncitadels of power. With its huge and\nimbalanced population, and its\ndiverse culture and traditions,\nChina today requires a leader with\nsufficient strength and prestige to\nsecure social stability, drive eco-\nnomic reform, and guide it in being\na responsible world power. Xi as\ncore leader should be good for\nChina and, thus, for the world.\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn isa public\nintellectual, political/economics\ncommentator, and an international\ncorporate strategist.

Kuhn, a weekly show\non CCTV News produced by Adam Zhu\n\nBring down the curtain on this idiotic political drama\n\nfeel you. It’s draining, to say the\n\nleast, especially when the\nmelodrama in Hong Kongis\ndragging out; it has become\ndownright dreadful when we know\nthere is no respite in sight.\n\nWe were supposed to havea\nbrief break after last September's\nLegislative Council polls, before the\nnext big event. Even though a large\nnumber of people will be unable to\ncasta vote in the Election\nCommittee subsector elections,\nless than a month away, and in the\nchief executive election, scheduled\nfor late March next year, the city\nshould by now be focusing on\nwhat's ahead.\n\nBut, thanks to the two recently\ndisqualified lawmakers, who lacked.\nthe necessary knowledge, ability\nand respect for oath-taking, our\n(albeit dystunctcnal) legislature\nhas basically been shut down fora\nmonth. The ugly politics that\nshould have been insulated within\n\n[ee ofall the politics, 1\n\nAlice Wu has had enough of the brouhaha over the\noath-taking by two lawmakers. Now that they’ve\nbeen disqualified, HK must focus on battles ahead\n\nthe chamber once again spilled out\nonto our streets.\n\nAnd what should have been\ndecided and concluded on\nSeptember4 isnow dragging on\nindefinitely, with two or possibly\nmore by-elections added to the\nelection overload.\n\nHell-raising politics is not going\naway any time soon, but the sheer\nstupidity of the localist pair's\nactions really is one for the books—\nMacbeth, in fact:\n\nTomorrow, and tomorrow, and\ntomorrow, / Creeps in this pet e\nfrom day today, - pape\n\nTo the last syllable of recorded\ntime, /Andallour yesterdays have\nlighted fools\n\nThe way to dusty death. Out, out,\n\nbriefcandle!/ Life's buta walking\nshadow, a poor player\n\nThatsthutsdnd pets ‘his hour\nupon the stage/And then is heard\nno more. Itisa tale\n\nTold byan idiot, fullofsound\nand fury, / Signifying nothing.\n\nhey wet tee hlloound\nand fury, and they did nothing for\nthecommon good.\n\nWhat they did opened the door\nfor an invitation to the courts to\nintervene. What they did presented\nan opportunity foran\ninterpretation of the Basic Law by\nthe National People’s Congress\nStanding Committee.\n\nWhat they did, oltenatey may\nwell become the precedent for\nother legislators to be similarly\n\nbarred. And that is why the duo's\npledge to spend every penny—and\nlest we forget, this also means the\nmounting cost to the public purse—\nto “appeal atall costs” isbeyond\nrich, coming from them.\n\nClearly, they have yet to wrap\ntheir heads around the concept of\n“personal responsibility”. Sixtus\nBaggio Leung Chung-hang is\nwrong in believing that their\ndisqualification from Legco\nrendered the election meaningless.\nThey have no one but themselves\nto blame for their defenestration. It\nistheywho made the election\nmeaningless.\n\nAnd, to add insult to the grave\ninjury they brought on the rest of\nus, they are asking for donations. At\nsome point—ifwe're not there\nalready—we must take serious\noffence to be taken as fools, again\nand again. The curtain must now\nbe drawn on this overly played-out\nsecond act.\n\nThe irony may be lost on the\n\npat butit's pretty obvious who has\neen played for total fools. In case\ntheyhaven’tnoticed, the\nlawmakers who served as the duo's\nchaperones have stopped\nbabysitting them because there is\nno value in being their keepers any\nmore. Escorting the duo's Legco\ngate-crashing attempts served their\npurpose: to usher the two straight\nto their political end, and the votes\nthe two rendered meaningless are\nnow political spoils.\n\nThe two took the toxic brewand\nthere will be no stay of execution\nthat could stop those ready to\ncontest their seats.\n\nWemust fight our political\nfatigue. We can ill afford to be\ndistracted by those who\ncontinuously try to foolishly make\ntheir own stupid mistakes our\ncollective problem.\n\nAlice Wu isa political consultant and\na former associate director of the\nAsia Pacific Media Network at UCLA\n\n> CONTACT US: Agree or disagree with the opinions on this page?

Perhaps neglected in the process has\nbeen a different but relevant concept: the law of\nunintended consequences, whereby an action gives\nrise to outcomes unforeseen by the instigator.\n\nHong Kong's tortuous path towards political reform\nisacase in point. The first reference to the idea of\nuniversal suffrage for selection of the chief executive\ncomes in Article 45 of the Basic Law, promulgated back\nin 1990. Looking towards 1997, its purpose was to\nreassure. Naturally, attention turned to the subject in\nthe early part of this century. While people understood\nthat the move towards universal suffrage had to be in\naccordance with the “principle of gradual and orderly\nprogress”, the reform package put forward in 2014 was\nwidely perceived as disappointing; the plan to stick\nwith an unrepresentative nominating committee\ndeciding who could enter the race was unpalatable.\n\nThe State Council's white paper on the governance\nof Hong Kong, intended to set things straight, only\nstirred things up and led to the Occupy Central\nprotests. The governmentlet the action linger, hoping\npublic anger would pay dividends in the 2016\nLegislative Council election. While the 79 days of\ndisruption did bring the protesters momentary\nopprobrium, memories quickly faded. In the election,\nthe pro-government share of the vote actually fell, and\nthe attack on the idea of independence led directly toa\nnear 20 percent share of the vote for a localist faction.\nThis was surely not the objective.\n\nNow the government is trying to overturn the\nelection outcome. The practice of banning some\npotential candidates from standing, then using all\nmeans at hand to unseat some of those elected, is a\ntactic more usually associated with third-world\ncountries following a military coup.\n\nHas something been lost in\ntranslation here? Perhaps\nwe need an interpretation\nof the interpretation\n\nIn the short term, the judicial review sought by the\nchief executive against the decision by Legco president\nAndrew Leung Kwan-yuen to give Sixtus Baggio Leung\nChung-hang and Yau Wai-ching another opportunity\nto take the oath has been successful. Mr Justice\n‘Thomas Au Hing-cheung ruled in the High Court that\ntheir oaths were invalid, they should notbe given a\nsecond chance and their positions should immediately\nbe vacated, Many observers thought he might decline\ntoruleatall, and simply refer the matter back to the\nLegco president. The problem with one arm of the\nadministration delving too deeply into the processes of\nanotheris thatit inevitably generates more requests to\ndoso. And, sure enough, we now have legal challenges\nagainst more legislators, plus. challenge against the\nchief executive himself.\n\nGiven that, in the past, other Legco members who\nhad politicised their swearing-in and then done it\nproperly second time round were permitted to take up\ntheir seats, did Leung and Yau havea “legitimate\nexpectation” that they would enjoy similar treatment?\nThe Legco president certainly thought so, hence his\norigin: ruling Nowitis for ahigher court to decide.\n\nMeanwhile, the National People's Congress\nStanding Committee has sought to clarify Article 104 of\nthe Basic Law, which requires all people concemed to\n“swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong\nspecial administrative region of the People’s Republic\nof China and swear allegiance” to it. But the\ninterpretation is different: it talks of “a legal pledge ... to\nthe People’s Republic of China and its Hong Kong\nSpecial Administrative Region” (emphasis added). Has\nsomething been lost in translation here? Perhaps we\nneed an interpretation of the interpretation.\n\nIf, atthe end of the day, there are two (ormore)\nvacant Legco seats, then we are in by-election territory.\nIdon’t think the people are fooled for one minute\nabout whatis going on. In each constituen\nimpeccable opposition candidate will stand, wina\nmajority, and take the oath impeccably. Unfortunately,\nthis tragedy - or farce —will continue until the\ngovernment starts to address the underlying\ngrievances over the lack of meaningful political reform\ninstead of just hammering the symptoms, which\ngenerates new grievances in the process.\n\nr | here has been a considerable focus recently on\n\nMike Rowse is the CEO of Treloar Enterprises and an\nadjunct professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.\nmike@rowse.com.hk\n\nAyellow umbrella, a symbol of the Occupy movement,\nis used ina recent protest against Beijing.
