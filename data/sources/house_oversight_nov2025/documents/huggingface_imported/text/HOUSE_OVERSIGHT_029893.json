I have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please \nhave Jane Doe sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form. \nAlso, will you agree to one more week on Responses to Net Wirth ROGS?? \nPlease let me know. \nJess — \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029896 \nfeJath &dwelt, e?, cia' \nCertified Paralegal \nFlorida Registered Paralegal \nBURMAN CRITTON LUTTIER & COLEMAN, LLP \n515 N.
