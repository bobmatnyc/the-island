Last\nyear’s modest 3.2% decline actually masked a\nmuch larger 10% drop from the euro’s intra-year\npeak, half of which came in the weeks following\nthe US elections in November. Needless to say, the\ncombination of potentially expansionary fiscal\npolicy put in place by the new administration\ncoupled with tighter US monetary policy represents\na stiff headwind to the euro, particularly since\n\nWe should not lose sight of the fact\nthat after such persistent weakness\nversus the US dollar, the euro is\nundervalued and investors are now\npositioned for further weakness.\n\nthe ECB just extended quantitative easing until\nDecember 2017.\n\nWe expect these transatlantic policy divergences\n\nto persist, driving European investors to continue\nseeking higher-yielding, non-euro-denominated\nassets abroad (see Exhibit 73). This preference\n\nwill likely be bolstered by uncertainty surrounding\nupcoming national elections in Germany, France,\nthe Netherlands and possibly Italy and Spain.\nWhile our central case assumes mainstream parties\nprevail, any result that raises questions about the\nlong-term viability of the European Monetary\n\nUnion could push the euro even lower.\n\nStill, we should not lose sight of the fact that\nafter such persistent weakness versus the US dollar,\nthe euro is undervalued and investors are now\npositioned for further weakness. Additionally, the\nabove-trend Eurozone growth and normalizing\ninflation we expect could justify the ECB shifting\ntoward a more neutral stance later this year.\n\nSuch a move would narrow the interest\nrate differential between the US and\nEurozone, weakening a linchpin of the\nweaker euro thesis.\n\nGiven this balance of risks, we\nremoved our tactical short positions in\nthe euro relative to the dollar following\nthe November US presidential election,\nreturning to a neutral view.\n\n62 | Goldman Sachs | JANUARY 2017\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014595",
