  "text": "they even insisted I change my name. I was no longer Ehud Brog. I’d\nHebraicized it: to Barak, which seemed near enough to the original. Among the\nfew dozen outside the unit who did know about my role, however, were\nparatroopers who’d joined us on various missions. One of them now told the El\nAl people who I was. Not only was I given a seat on the first overnight plane\nback to Tel Aviv. I found myself helping the airline establish a priority for\nassigning seats to others: first, active officers in fighting units: armor, infantry,\nthe air force. Then, reservists, with the emphasis on those who’d seen active\nservice most recently.\n\nAs we were waiting to board, I phoned Uzi Dayan and asked him to meet me\nat Lod the next morning. Then I called Motta again. “Ehud,” he said, with no\ntrace of irony, “it is an extremely serious war. Syrian tanks are getting close to\nthe outer fences of Nafakh” — our main command post on the Golan. “Good\nluck.”\n\nUzi was waiting for me when we landed. Walking to his car, we ran into two\nreserve armored officers who had also just arrived home. They expected to be\nsent north, to help beat back the Syrian advance. When they asked me where I\nthought I’d be going, I said, truthfully, I had no idea. “Wherever I can help,” I\nsaid. Uzi drove us to the bor, the bunker built two floors underground in the\nkirya. Usually, it functioned as the day-to-day operations center. But it was\nwhere the commanders of the armed forces operated during times of war.\n\nAt officers’ school, we’d heard and read about the importance of throwing\nthe enemy “off balance”. Now, we were the ones off balance. The faces I saw\naround me were gray and drawn. There were dead looks in the eyes of the\ncommanders and their staff. Some 30 hours after the surprise attack, all the self-\nconfidence we’d felt since 1967 seemed to have evaporated. I looked into\nseveral of the rooms where, months earlier, I’d run through operational plans as\nsayeret commander. Inside each, a large wall map traced the course of the\nfighting. Israeli forces were marked in blue, the Syrians and Egyptians in red,\nwith a timestamp for each position report scribbled at the side in black magic\nmarker. But I saw that the latest addition was from at least twelve hours earlier.\nIt was as if we'd lost track of what was happening, or were simply\noverwhelmed by the pace of events.\n\nI spoke briefly with Talik as he walked along the corridor. He looked 10\nyears older than when I’d last seen him. Then I spotted Ahrahle Yariv, who had\nbeen called back into military intelligence at the start of the war. Looking\nsurprised to see me back in Israel, he pulled me close to him. “It’s important\n\n147\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027995",
