  "text": "allegations that other faculty do not receive, each of which the University has to respond to. The fact that I have\nremained a professor in all Universities with which I have been associated, in good standing, and also an officer\nor an invited speaker at organizations like CFI, which have strict harassment policies, is a confirmation of the\nfact that they trust my behavior. I was asked to be an honorary director of CFI, and invited to their last 3\nmeetings to speak, specifically because, as they have written me after the fact, the attendees universally\nappreciated my talks, my courtesy, and graciousness in spending time with the attendees. If the purpose of your\nreport is to impugn my integrity or suggest I have a history of harassment, that too is false. As noted in one of\nyour ‘miscellaneous facts’, as a scientist I try and remain skeptical, and rely on empirical evidence, rather than\nallegations and innuendo. I also try and judge the facts in context. The fact that Universities and other\norganizations employ me or have me on their boards, or invite me to meetings is because they value my\ncontributions and my actions.\n\nYour specific allegations are false or distorted. Item | refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in\n2006 where we mutually decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be\nappropriate, and had respectful encounters afterwards. I cannot comment on item 3, which involves an\nanonymous 3rd party claim, because I know nothing about it, and it was not taken seriously enough to result in\nany university action. Item 4 is confusing. Are you saying that because I decided I didn’t want to go out to a\nbar with a group of attendees that I was harassing them? The second part is false. I don’t do that. Re incident\n5: The ‘female companion’ in this case is my wife, who can attest to the fact that the claim is false, which is\nwhat I wrote in response to the blog in question, causing it to be taken down.\n\nIt is worthwhile responding to Item 2 and 6 in more detail,\n\nRe item 2: the student in question was interested in science communication, and on dozens of occasions came\nto me or wrote to me with questions. When she asked about advice for after graduation I DID tell her she was\ndifferent than the other students in her year. The rest of them were interested in going on to graduate school,\nbut she was interested in science communication so I told her that she might want to take a different path. Since\nshe was the only woman in her year, as I recall, I did ask her on one of these occasions if that made it difficult\nfor her in any way. I asked, because as a faculty member I was interested, and also because as someone she had\nasked for career advice from I wanted to know if that made a difference to her. Re asking her for dinner.. I have\ngone back over emails from that period. I have numerous requests from her to go for coffee to talk, which I\nusually had to turn down because I was busy, including several occasions where she asked me to have coffee\nwith her off campus to talk, and I politely declined. I did let her accompany me off campus one time to watch\nme do a BBC interview because she specifically requested it. I did and do have coffee and meals with students\non campus, and I see nothing wrong with this. I was shocked when I later learned of her complaint, not least\nbecause there was no inappropriate interaction and also because well after the date on which she is said to have\nbeen offended, she continued to email me with joking questions or comments, and ata AAAS conference in\n2008, for which she had asked, and for which I had written her a letter of recommendation to attend, my wife\nand I gave her a lift well out out of our way to drop her off at her hotel, and I note in an email response to her\nemail about the conference, agin in 2008, I expressed that I would pass her regards along to my wife and vice\nversa. When the University informed me of the complaint I was shocked and concerned. When I spoke to\n\nthe human resources person, including relating my concerns and providing the emails in question, I was told\nthat no formal complaint of sexual harassment was deemed to be warranted in this case, and that the young\nwoman in question had agreed to that. By that time I learned of the complaint I had already announced my\nintentions to leave Case to accept an offer at ASU—a very difficult decision for me because of my long-\nstanding attachment to the University, and the excellent relations I had with my colleagues there, both among\nthe faculty and among the administration. Because I was already in Arizona at the time I was asked not to have\nany further interaction with the student I agreed to that request because it was basically moot. I was also told\nthat because it was being handled informally, that (a) it should remain confidential, which I, at least abided by,\nand (b) if no further complaints were lodged in that case, that the University would remove the allegation from\nmy record after 5 years, which makes me surprised that someone violated that written agreement with you.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031249",
