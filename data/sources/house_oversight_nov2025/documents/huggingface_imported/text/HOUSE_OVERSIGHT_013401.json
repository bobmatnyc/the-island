  "text": "Edwards adv. Epstein\nCase No.: 502009CA040800XXXXMBAG\nSecond Renewed Motion for Leave to Assert Claim for Punitive Damages\n\nARGUMENT\nIL. THE RECORD AND PROFFERED EVIDENCE ESTABLISHES THAT\n\nEDWARDS’S CONDUCT COULD NOT POSSIBLY FORM THE BASIS OF ANY\nLIABILITY IN FAVOR OF EPSTEIN\n\nA. The Summary Judgment Standard.\n\nRule 1.510(c), Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that a court may enter summary\njudgment when the pleadings, depositions and factual showings reveal that there is no genuine\nissue. of material fact and that the moving-party is entitled to judgment as-a-matter of law.
