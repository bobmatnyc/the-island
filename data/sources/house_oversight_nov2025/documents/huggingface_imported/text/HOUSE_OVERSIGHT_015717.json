  "text": "Mind over Computer DT\n\nIQ Test\n\nHumans are intelligent. (If you disagree with this premise then\nyou're going to have a problem with this argument!) If you talk to a\ncomputer and cannot tell it from a human, it must also be intelligent:\nQED. The logic is sound but somehow feels wrong. It neatly, but\nirritatingly, sidesteps the whole problem of defining intelligence.\n\nIn 1912, William Stern devised a method for measuring intelligence\nin children. He named it ‘IQ’ from the German Intelligenz-Quotient.\nYou may have taken one of these tests at school. The tests consist of a\nseries of abstract reasoning problems that minimize cultural references.\nFor example, you might be asked to look at a set of blocks with dots on\nthem and identify which is the odd one out. Numerous versions of the\ntest have been developed over the years, but nowadays we mostly use one\nof three standard tests, Wechsler being the most common.\n\nMeasuring intelligence is complicated. Culture and language play a\nbig part. If we take a tribe of Amazonian Indians and ask them to list the\npresidents of the United States, they will fail. That does not mean they’re\nstupid. Drop me into the Amazon Rainforest and I will probably starve\nto death; they, on the other hand, can live off the land as hunter-gatherers\nwith only a few hours work per day. Who is more intelligent?\n\nOne problem with IQ is that individual candidate scores can differ\nwildly from test to test, sometimes by as much as 20 points. That’s huge. At\nthe high end of the scale it can be the difference between being classified\nas smart or as a genius; and, at the low end, between being average or\nmentally subnormal. These variations don’t usually matter and most\nuniversities and colleges take IQ with a pinch of salt, preferring more\nspecific tests such as SATs in America, the Baccalaureate in Europe or A\nlevels in the UK. IQ can be very important; and is sometimes a matter of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015717",
