If US intelligence services used it, the targets could figure out\nthat anyone visiting a site without an IP address was using TOR software to hide it. If TOR was\nexclusive used by US intelligence services, the targets could further deduce that all the\nanonymous visitors were avatars for American intelligence. It would be analogous to undercover\npolice using pink-color cars that civilians did not use.\n\nTo remedy this flaw, the US government in 2008 made TOR software open-source and freely\navailable to everyone in the world. It even provided funding for its promulgation with the State\nDepartment, the National Science Foundation, and the Broadcasting Board of Governors\nfinancing TOR’s core developer. The public rationale for this generosity was that TOR could\nserve as a tool for, as the State Department called it, “democracy advocates in authoritarian\nstates.\" The result was TOR software became a tool of both intelligence services and their\nadversaries.\n\nAs TOR software became widely used by adversaries (as well as common criminals), the NSA\nsought to find vulnerabilities in it. “It should hardly be surprising that our intelligence agencies\nseek ways to counteract targets’ that use TOR software to hide their communications, explained a\nNSA spokesperson. The NSA’s adversaries also took an interest in identifying TOR users.\n\nTOR software also took on a cult-like importance to hacktavists concerned with the US\ngovernment tracking their activities. An illuminating insight into the mind-set of the TOR\nhacktavists is provided by Catherine A. Fitzpatrick in her 2013 book Privacy For Me Not For\nThee. She describes these hacktavists as largely “radical anarchists,” who believe “the state is all-\npowerful, that law-enforcement is so strong that it will prevail anyway, and that they are a\npersecuted minority.” As a refuge against the surveillance of the state, and in particular the NSA,\nthey not only hide attempt to their own identity nut use encryption to obscure their messages.\nTheir goal is free their movements from “of any interference from law-enforcement.” In this mind-\nset, according to Fitzpatrick, “They believe government intelligence agencies will stop at nothing\nto stop them from absolute encryption.”\n\nTOR software was a means to defeat the NSA, but to be successfully there needed to be such a\nproliferation of TOR servers that the NSA could not piece together IP addresses. The problem\nwas that in 2012 the TOR project, as they called it, was still a very tiny operation in 2012. It\nemployed less than 100 core developers who were located mainly in Germany, Iceland, Japan,\nEstonia, and the United States. Its staff worked mainly out of a single room in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts.\n\nThe guiding spirit behind the TOR movement was Jacob Appelbaum, a charismatic 28-year old\nwho had grown up in northern California. Like Snowden, he had dropped out of high school.\nAppelbaum identified himself to his followers on the Internet as a “hacktivist” battling state\nsurveillance. For him, as with many in the hacktavist culture, the main enemy was the NSA. After\nall, the NSA had a vast army of computer scientists working to unravel TOR software.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020224",
