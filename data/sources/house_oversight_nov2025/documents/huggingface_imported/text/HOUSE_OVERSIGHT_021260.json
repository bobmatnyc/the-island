  "text": "interconnectivity to humans for\nmillennia. Just as computers have\ncapacities and processes that are\ntransduced through but extend far\nbeyond the hardware of a single\ncomputer, the human brain has evolved\nto promote social and cultural capacities\nand processes that are transduced\nthrough but that extend far beyond a\nsolitary brain. To understand the full\ncapacity of humans, one needs to\nappreciate not only the memory and\ncomputational power of the brain but its\ncapacity for representing, understanding,\nand connecting with other individuals.\nThat is, one needs to recognize that we\nhave evolved a powerful, meaning\nmaking social brain.\n\nSocial species, by definition,\ncreate structures beyond the individual—\nstructures ranging from dyads and\nfamilies to institutions and cultures.\nThese emergent structures have evolved\nhand in hand with neural and hormonal\nmechanisms to support them because the\nconsequent social behaviors (e.g.,\ncooperation, empathy, altruism, etc.)\nhelped these organisms survive,\nreproduce, and care for offspring\nsufficiently long that they too\nreproduced. From an evolutionary\nperspective then, the social context is\nfundamental in the evolution and\ndevelopment of the human brain.\n\nThe observable consequences of\nthese higher organizations have long\nbeen apparent, but we are only now\nbeginning to understand their genetic,\nneural, and biochemical basis and\nconsequences. To fully delve into these\ncomplex behaviors, science needs to deal\nwith the invisible forces that shape\nhuman life, whether it is in the form of\nphysical, biological, or psychological\nforces. For instance, anthropomorphism,\nthe irrepressible proclivity to attribute\n\nPage |14\n\nhuman characteristics onto nonhuman\nobjects to achieve meaning,\npredictability, and human connection, is\nbeginning to be subjected to productive\nmulti-level scientific analysis.\nExperimental studies have shown that\nmanipulations which increase feelings of\nsocial isolation without the possibility of\nresolving these feelings through human\ninteraction have the compensatory effect\nof increasing people’s tendency to\nanthropomorphize, including heightened\nbeliefs in God. This scientific work has\nimplications for understanding claims\nregarding the success of religious\npractices such as solitude as paths to\nfeeling closer God. Research on\nanthropomorphism has now identified\ndevelopmental, situational, dispositional,\nand cultural factors that modulate\npeople’s tendency to anthropomorphize\nnonhuman agents ranging from\ntechnological gadgets to animals to gods,\nand the neural mechanisms underlying\nthis transconfiguration of nonhuman\nobjects into human-like agents are\nbeginning to be revealed.\n\nGuided by the insights from\nthese new scientific theories of\nanthropomorphism, historical analyses\nmay be worthwhile to determine whether\nconcepts of god have changed across\ntime and cultures such that god was\ncreated in the image of the believer\nrather than vice versa. Xenophanes (6th\ncentury B.C., cited in 9), for instance,\nwas apparently the first to use the term\n“anthropomorphism” when describing\nthe similarities between religious agents\nand their believers, noting that Greek\ngods were invariably fair skinned and\nblue-eyed whereas African gods were\ninvariably dark skinned and dark-eyed\n(joking that cows would surely worship\ngods that looked strikingly cow-like).\nBrain imaging research has confirmed\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021260",
