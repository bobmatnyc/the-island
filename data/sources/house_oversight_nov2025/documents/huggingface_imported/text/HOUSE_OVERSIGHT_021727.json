Priebus\ncould take a lesson from history in his efforts to\nherd his fellow elephants into a big tent. Nobody\ndid a better job of coaxing feuding Republicans to\ncooperate than Ray C. Bliss, the Akron, Ohio,\ninsurance man who chaired the national committee\nfrom 1965 to 1969. His success is worth\nremembering.\n\nWhen Bliss became chairman in 1965, the\nRepublicans. were in much worse shape than in\n2013: President Lyndon Johnson had won a Jand-\nslide re-election over Arizona Sen. Barry\nGoldwater, and the Democrats held large majorities\nin both houses of Congress and the statehouses.\n\nThe party was deeply divided between “moder-\nates,” such as New York Gov. Nelson Rockefeller;\nand “conservatives,” like Goldwater. The latter\nappeared to bless strident voices when he famously\nproclaimed; “Let me remind you that extremism in\ndefénse of liberty is no vice. And let me remind\n. you also that moderation i in pursuit of justice is no\nvirtue.”\n\nAlthough best known as a “nuts-and-bolts” party\nmechanic, Bliss used a two-step approach to\naddress these ideological rifts.\n\nThe first step was to challenge voices that made\nRepublicans look extreme to voters. On Nov. 5, 1965,\nhe issued _n even-handed critique of “radicals” on the\nleftand night, singling out a stamchly anti-communist\nfirebrand Robert Welch:\n\n“One of my major concems in the matter of extrem-\nism of the radical right is that honest, patriotic andcon-\nscientious conservatives may be misjudged because of\nitesponsible radicals such as Robert Welch, who has\naccused President Eisenhower of being 4 ‘dedicated,\nconscious agent of the Communist conspiracy.”\n\n“We've got to get this (party) in the middle of the\nroad,” Bliss explained, “Eisenhower and his people\nhave takenenough.”\n\n‘There was a sharp badkdash, One letter writer called\nBliss “sneaky” and fisther:\n\n“You recently asked all Republicans to get out of the\n\nWilliam Hershey & John C. Green\n\nstrongest and most effective anti-Communist orpaniza-\ntion in the United States. I question your motives.”\n\nBliss wasn’t bothered by the criticism. “I don’t\nhave the fixation I have all the answers,” he told\nreporters, “everything is compromise.”\n\nHis second step was leading Republicans to com-\nmon ground.\n\nThe means was the Republican Coordinating\nCommittee. Its members were a cross-section of\nthe party: Eisenhower and four former presidential\ncandidates — Goldwater, Richard Nixon, Alfred\nLandon and Thomas Dewey —~ as well as gover-\nnors, members of Congress, state legislators, and\nparty leaders.\n\nEisenhower was a key to the committee’s work.\n\n“He backed me up in the earlyd ys of my chair-\nmanship,” Bliss reported, “He had the respect of all\nfactions.”\n\nThe method was face-to-face dialogue.\n\n“You don’t say anything nasty, at least not pub-\nticly, about somebody you're going to dinner with\ntonight,” Bliss said.\n\nThe committee eventually produced 48 policy\nproposals, offering an alternative to President\nJohnson’s “Great Society” program.\n\nIn the end, Bliss got the results he wanted: the GOP\n\nmade a huge comeback in the 1966 elections, and in\n1968, it won back the White House.\n\nOf course, 2013 is not 1965, Mitt Romney i is no\n\nBarry Goldwater, nor is the party division identical.\nAndthe GOP may lack an Eisenhower to rally around.\nStill, Chairman Priebus could take a lesson from\nChairman Bliss’ success in herding the elephants into a\nbig tent.\n— William Hershey is a former Knight-Ridder\nWashington corres pondent and Columbus bureau chief\nJor the Alron Beacon Journal and Dayton Daily News.\nJohn Green is director of the Bliss Institute of\n\nApplied Politics at the University of Alvon.\n\nA Nau SURVEY SUSGESTS\n\nARE LIVING IN A\\NORLD\ncom VENISIGN, cea ih ts\n\nTHAT 172 OF AMERICANS: |\n\ntee ‘iM if i)\"\n\nThe Virgin Islands Daily News 31\n\n‘Time to hard-delete Carlos Danger\n\nWhen you puzzle over why the ele-\ngant Huma Abedin ‘is propping up the\neel-like Anthony Weiner, you must\nremember one thing: Huma was raised\nin Saudi Arabia, where women are\ntreated worse by men than anywhere\nelse on the planet. ,\n\nComparatively speaking, the pol\nfrom Queens probably seems like a\nprince. Even though he’s a punk. After\nhe got caught sexting and flashing\nwomen online in 2011, he promised to\n“never, ever” do that to his family again\nand slouched away from Congress..He\ncyber-creeped other young women in a.\npervy bout of tweet du seigneur as his\nwife traveled the world with Hillary\nClinton while she was secretary of\nstate.\n\nYet, while married to the claSsy, gor--\ngeous mother of his infant son-and\nplanning a redemptive run for mayor,\nhe told a Facebook friend and phone-\nsex partner he had never met that he\n\n“loved her. Then he told her to “hard-\n\ndelete” all their correspondence — if\nthat is what you call it.\n\nAside from his zany Zorro-like nom\nde pom, Carlos Danger, Weiner h s been\ncalled many things. His‘digital girlfriend\nand fellow extreme exhibitionist, Sydney\nLeathers (whose n me sounds like anom\nde porn), said that Weiner described him-\nselfto her accurately as “an argumenta-\ntive, perpetually homy middle-aged\nmap.” :\n\nBut Weiner’s Goyaesque grotesquerie\neams him another name: the “Rosemary’s\nBaby” of the Clintons.\n\nBill nd Hillary Clinton transf ormed\nthe way we look at sex scandals. They\nplowed through the: ridicule, refused to\nslink away in'shame like Gary Hart, said\nit was old news, and argued that if Hillary\n\n\"didn’t object, why should voters?\n\nPoppy Bush thought Amerigans would\n\nreject Bill Clinton ii 1992 because of his\nlascivious ways, but he learned that vot-\n\nefs are more concerned with how their\n\n‘<own lives will be changed than they are\n\nwith politicians’ duplicitous private lives.\nAmericans keep moving the marker of\ncceptable behavior, partly as a reflection\nof the coarsening of society and partly as\na public acknowledgment that many pols\nwith complicated personal lives have\nbeen good public servants.\n\nNow, defining deviancy downward,\nSeiior and Seiiora Danger are using the\nCimton playbook.\n\nThe difference is, there’s nothing i in\nWeiner’s public life that is redeeming. In\n12 years in Congress, he m naged to get\nonly one minor bill passed, on behalf ofa\ndonor, and he doesn’t werk well with\npeople. He knows how to be loud on\ncable and wave his Zorro sword in our\nfaces\n\nSome sex scandals, like Mark\nSanford’s, fall into the realm of flawed\nhuman nature, nd some, like Weiner’s, .\nfall into the realm of “Seriously, what is\n\nPy\n\nMaureen Dowd\n\nwrong with you?”\n\nHuma gained renown, movie star suit-\nors and a Vogue spread as the stylish\nMuslim Garbo silently and efficiently\nparting the waves for Hillary. She had to\nbe resilient to work her way up from\nintern to consigliere in ‘tough\nHillaryworld, and she saw firsthand how\nthe Clintons beat back foes.\n\nThey love Huma, but the Clintons,\nnow showcasing philanthropy and public\nservice preparatory to Hillary’s 2016 run,\nare not happy about getting dragged into\nthe lewd spectacle that is a low-budget\nmovie version of their masterpiece.\n\nThe former president is distancing\nhimself, one associate said, noting, “He’s\nnot getting anywhere near that grenade.”\n\nHuma’s friends are “slappmg-my-fore-\nhead astounded,” as one put it, that\nWeiner would get in the race knowing\nthe online land mines that would rock\nHuma’s world again and torpedo the\n\nWeiner wooed Huma assiduously,\nshowing up at the Westchester airport\nin the wee hours to pick her up when\nshe came back from trips with Hillary.\n“They were two hyperdrive young\nbrains that just clicked,” said a friend.\n“She liked his Borscht Belt humor.”\n\nHer circle understands that “you love\nwho you love,” as one put it, marveling\nat Weiner’s “madonna-whore” com-\nplex played out online. But that doesn’t\nméan that you ask people to vote for\nsomeone who’s dreadfully flawed for a\nmajor office, just because you love\nhim. :\n\nThey are wortied that Huma’s deci-\nsion to vouch for her husband i is-start-\ning to hurt her, the one person they all\nassumed woiild: never bé-ensnared m\nanything weird or bad. “The hard stink\nof this one is going to get ou everyone\ninvolved,” said one friend:\n\nAnother agreed: “As soon as she stood\nup to. say those words she changed her-\nself from a sophisticated, mysterious\nguiding intelligence and beauty next to\nHillary Clinton to the wife of a tamished\nAnthony Weiner.” ;\n\nThey fear Huma learned the wrong\nlesson from Hillary, given that Bill was a\nroguish genius while Weiner’s a creepy\nloser.\n\n“Bill Clinton was the greatest political\nand policy mind of a generation,” said\none. “Anthony is behaving similarly\nwithout the chops or résumé.”\n\n- As often as Bill apologized, he didn’t\npremise he would “never, ever” do it\nagain, s Weiner did.\n\n“What people won’t forgive is lying in\nthe apology,” said the Clinton pal. “It has\nto be sincere, and it sure as hell has to be\naccurate,”’\n\n— Maureen Dowd is a New York\nTimes columnist.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021727",
