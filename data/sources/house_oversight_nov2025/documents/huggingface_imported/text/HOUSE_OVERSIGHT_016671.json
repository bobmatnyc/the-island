Note that the City of NY\nproduces about 33 times the amount of water than the City of West Palm Beach. We tried to compile\ndata that can be comparable. However, NYC act as their own State agency and track different\nparameters than the State of Florida. See below for additional information.\n\nEduardo E.

NCY produces 1.1 billion mgd per day.\n\nBelow is what they say about their treatment process:\n\nWater Treatment\n\nAll surface water and groundwater entering New York\nCity’s distribution system is treated with chlorine, fluoride,\nfood grade phosphoric acid and, in some cases, sodium\nhydroxide. New York City uses chlorine to meet the New\nYork State Sanitary Code and federal Safe Drinking Water\nAct (SDWA) disinfection requirements. Fluoride, at a\nconcentration of one part per million, is added to help\nprevent tooth decay and has been added since 1966 in\naccordance with the New York City Health Code. Phosphoric\nacid 1s added to create a protective film on pipes that\nreduces the release of metals such as lead from household\nplumbing. Sodium hydroxide is added to Catskill/Delaware\nwater to raise the pH and reduce corrosivity.\n\nDavid Hanks\n\nPublic Utilities Director\n\nCity of West Palm Beach\n1000 45th Street, Suite # 15\nWest Palm Beach, FL 33407\n\n561-494-1046 Work\nE\nce!\n\n561-714-4619 Cell\ndhanks@wpb.org ‘ater Quality Tables. xls\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016671",
