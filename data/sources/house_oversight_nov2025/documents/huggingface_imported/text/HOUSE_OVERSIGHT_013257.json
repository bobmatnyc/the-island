It’s possible to have multple LTI values pertaining to different time scales,\nbut so far practical implementation and most theory has centered on the option of a single\nLTI value.\n\nSimilarity: a link type indicating the probabilistic similarity between two different Atoms.\nGenerically this is a combination of Intensional Similarity (similarity of properties) and\nExtensional Similarity (similarity of members).\n\nSimple Truth Value: a TruthValue involving a pair (s,d) indicating strength (e.g. proba-\nbility or fuzzy set membership) and confidence d. d may be replaced by other options such\nas a count n or a weight of evidence w.\n\ne Simulation World: See Internal Simulation World\n\ne SMEPH (Self-Modifying Evolving Probabilistic Hypergraphs): a style of modeling\nsystems, in which each system is associated with a derived hypergraph\n\nSMEPH Edge: A link ina SMEPH derived hypergraph, indicating an empirically observed\nrelationship (e.g. inheritance or similarity) between two\n\nSMEPH Vertex: A node in a SMEPH derived hypergraph representing a system, indicat-\ning a collection of system states empirically observed to arise in conjunction with the same\nexternal stimuli\n\nSpatial Inference: PLN reasoning including Atoms that explicitly reference spatial rela-\ntionships\n\nSpatiotemporal Inference: PLN reasoning including Atoms that explicitly reference spa-\ntial and temporal relationships\n\ne STI: Shorthand for Short Term Importance\n\ne Strength: The main component of a TruthValue object, lying in the interval [0,1], refer-\nring either to a probability (in cases like InheritanceLink, SimilarityLink, EquivalenceLink,\nImplicationLink, etc.) or a fuzzy value (as in MemberLink, EvaluationLink).\n\nStrong Self-Modification: This is generally used as synonymous with Self-Modification,\nin a CogPrime context.\n\nSubsymbolic: Involving processing of data using elements that have no correspondence to\nnatural language terms, nor abstract concepts; and that are not naturally interpreted as\nsymbolically “standing for’ other things. Often used to refer to processes such as perception\nprocessing or motor control, which are concerned with entities like pixels or commands like\n“rotate servomotor 15 by 10 degrees theta and 55 degrees phi.” The distinction between\n“symbolic” and \"subsymbolic” is conventional in the history of AI, but seems difficult to\nformalize rigorously. Logic-based AI systems are typically considered “symbolic”, yet\nSupercompilation: A technique for program optimization, which globally rewrites a pro-\ngram into a usually very different looking program that does the same thing. A prototype\nsupercompiler was applied to Combo programs with successful results.\n\nSurface Realization: The process of taking a collection of Atoms and transforming them\ninto a series of words in a (usually natural) language. A stage in the overall process of\nlanguage generation.\n\nSymbol Grounding: The mapping of a symbolic term into perceptual or motoric entities\nthat help define the meaning of the symbolic term. For instance, the concept Cat” may be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013257",
