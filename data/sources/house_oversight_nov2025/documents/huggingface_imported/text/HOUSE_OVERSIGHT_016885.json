  "text": "change, and in which no stepwise, hierarchical, or abstract reasoning is necessary. Many\nof the successes come not from a better understanding of the workings of intelligence but\nfrom the brute-force power of faster chips and Bigger Data, which allow the programs to\nbe trained on millions of examples and generalize to similar new ones. Each system is an\nidiot savant, with little ability to leap to problems it was not set up to solve, and a brittle\nmastery of those it was. And to state the obvious, none of these programs has made a\nmove toward taking over the lab or enslaving its programmers.\n\nEven if an artificial intelligence system tried to exercise a will to power, without\nthe cooperation of humans it would remain an impotent brain in a vat. A superintelligent\nsystem, in its drive for self-improvement, would somehow have to build the faster\nprocessors that it would run on, the infrastructure that feeds it, and the robotic effectors\nthat connect it to the world—all impossible unless its human victims worked to give it\ncontrol of vast portions of the engineered world. Of course, one can always imagine a\nDoomsday Computer that is malevolent, universally empowered, always on, and\ntamperproof. The way to deal with this threat is straightforward: Don’t build one.\n\nWhat about the newer AI threat, the value-alignment problem, foreshadowed in\nWiener’s allusions to stories of the Monkey’s Paw, the genie, and King Midas, in which a\nwisher rues the unforeseen side effects of his wish? The fear is that we might give an AI\nsystem a goal and then helplessly stand by as it relentlessly and literal-mindedly\nimplemented its interpretation of that goal, the rest of our interests be damned. If we\ngave an AI the goal of maintaining the water level behind a dam, it might flood a town,\nnot caring about the people who drowned. If we gave it the goal of making paper clips, it\nmight turn all the matter in the reachable universe into paper clips, including our\npossessions and bodies. If we asked it to maximize human happiness, it might implant us\nall with intravenous dopamine drips, or rewire our brains so we were happiest sitting in\njars, or, if it had been trained on the concept of happiness with pictures of smiling faces,\ntile the galaxy with trillions of nanoscopic pictures of smiley-faces.\n\nFortunately, these scenarios are self-refuting. They depend on the premises that\n(1) humans are so gifted that they can design an omniscient and omnipotent AI, yet so\nidiotic that they would give it control of the universe without testing how it works; and\n(2) the AI would be so brilliant that it could figure out how to transmute elements and\nrewire brains, yet so imbecilic that it would wreak havoc based on elementary blunders of\nmisunderstanding. The ability to choose an action that best satisfies conflicting goals is\nnot an add-on to intelligence that engineers might forget to install and test; it is\nintelligence. So is the ability to interpret the intentions of a language user in context.\n\nWhen we put aside fantasies like digital megalomania, instant omniscience, and\nperfect knowledge and control of every particle in the universe, artificial intelligence 1s\nlike any other technology. It is developed incrementally, designed to satisfy multiple\nconditions, tested before it is implemented, and constantly tweaked for efficacy and\nsafety.\n\nThe last criterion is particularly significant. The culture of safety in advanced\nsocieties is an example of the humanizing norms and feedback channels that Wiener\ninvoked as a potent causal force and advocated as a bulwark against the authoritarian or\nexploitative implementation of technology. Whereas at the turn of the 20th century\nWestern societies tolerated shocking rates of mutilation and death in industrial, domestic,\nand transportation accidents, over the course of the century the value of human life\n\n82\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016885",
