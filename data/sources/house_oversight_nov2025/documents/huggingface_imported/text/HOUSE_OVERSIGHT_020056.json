  "text": "intuitive understanding of family, ceremony, and ritual and propriety, truly scored.\n\nThe foreign policy establishment had a long and well-honed relationship with MBS’s\nrival, the crown prince, Mohammed bin Nayef (MBN). Key NSA and State Department\nfigures were alarmed that Kushner’s discussions and fast-advancing relationship with\nMBS would send a dangerous message to MBN. And of course it did. The foreign policy\npeople believed Kushner was being led by MBS, whose real views were entirely untested.\nThe Kushner view was either, naively, that he wasn’t being led, or, with the confidence of\na thirty-six-year-old assuming the new prerogatives of the man in charge, that he didn’t\ncare: let’s embrace anybody who will embrace us.\n\nThe Kushner/MBS plan that emerged was straightforward in a way that foreign policy\nusually isn’t: If you give us what we want, we’ll give you what you want. On MBS’s\nassurance that he would deliver some seriously good news, he was invited to visit the\nWhite House in March. (The Saudis arrived with a big delegation, but they were received\nat the White House by only the president’s small circle—and the Saudis took particular\nnote that Trump ordered Priebus to jump up and fetch him things during the meeting.) The\ntwo large men, the older Trump and much younger MBS—both charmers, flatterers, and\ncountry club jokers, each in their way—grandly hit it off.\n\nIt was an aggressive bit of diplomacy. MBS was using this Trump embrace as part of\nhis own power play in the kingdom. And the Trump White House, ever denying this was\nthe case, let him. In return, MBS offered a basket of deals and announcements that would\ncoincide with a scheduled presidential visit to Saudi Arabia—Trump’s first trip abroad.\nTrump would get a “win.”\n\nPlanned before the Comey firing and Mueller hiring, the trip had State Department\nprofessionals alarmed. The itinerary—May 19 to May 27—was too long for any president,\nparticularly such an untested and untutored one. (Trump himself, full of phobias about\ntravel and unfamiliar locations, had been grumbling about the burdens of the trip.) But\ncoming immediately after Comey and Mueller it was a get-out-of-Dodge godsend. There\ncouldn’t have been a better time to be making headlines far from Washington. A road trip\ncould transform everything.\n\nAlmost the entire West Wing, along with State Department and National Security staff,\nwas on board for the trip: Melania Trump, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Reince Priebus,\nStephen Bannon, Gary Cohn, Dina Powell, Hope Hicks, Sean Spicer, Stephen Miller, Joe\nHagin, Rex Tillerson, and Michael Anton. Also included were Sarah Huckabee Sanders,\nthe deputy press secretary; Dan Scavino, the administration’s social media director; Keith\nSchiller, the president’s personal security adviser; and Wilbur Ross, the commerce\nsecretary. (Ross was widely ridiculed for never missing an Air Force One opportunity—as\nBannon put it, “Wilbur is Zelig, every time you turn around he’s in a picture.””) This trip\nand the robust American delegation was the antidote, and alternate universe to the Mueller\nappointment.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020056",
