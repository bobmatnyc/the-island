  "text": "How strange that the incident from the entire eight years | spent as\nVice President that stands out most prominently in my memory occurred\nnot in the White House but in Peru. There was a rioter who spat on me,\nand it was with great pleasure that | kicked him in the shins.\n\nBack in the safety of our hotel that night, | recalled an early formal\ndebate at Whittier College— “Resolved: that insects are more beneficial\nthan harmful” —because | had been so intrigued as to how insects did not\nthink, they just acted. Now, having myself acted totally without hesitation,\n| was able to identify with those insects.\n\nAs Vice President, | labored diligently behind the scenes to establish\nOperation 40, by which our CIA covertly trained Cuban intelligence officers\nin exile. Operation 40 was to serve as our link between the White House\nand the CIA in April of 1961. My plan was to invade Cuba.\n\nIronically, during the 1960 presidential campaign, Kennedy began\nadvocating my plan. | could not reveal that it was a/ready in effect because\nOperation 40 was a secret project. Further, | found myself in the\nschizophrenic position of attacking my own idea whenever Kennedy\n\narticulated it, because it violated our treaty commitments.\n\nzk k *\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015101",
