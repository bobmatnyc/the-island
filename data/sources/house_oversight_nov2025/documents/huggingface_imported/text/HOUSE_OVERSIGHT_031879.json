  "text": "ideological distance between the Muslim world and the West in\ngeneral would widen — and opportunities for friendship and\ncooperation between the two could vanish.” This from our ally, not to\nmention friendly gas station.\n\nThe tone of the column is both remarkable and ominous. It comes, as\nI said, from a man of little charm, but he is nevertheless a skilled\ndiplomat and intelligence chief. While his vexation over the\nPalestinian problem is well-known, rarely has it been carried to this\nextent — and in such a public venue.\n\nA Post opinion column is designed to get the attention of the\nAmerican government. I’m sure Prince Turki succeeded in that. But I\nhope he also got the attention of the Israeli government, which for\nsome time now has enjoyed Saudi moderation on the Palestinian\nquestion. That seems about to change — not the least because the\nArab street that Turki expressly mentioned is demanding it and the\nSaudis will, if they have to, appease the street. This is the gravamen\nof Prince Turki’s piece and is why he ends it so ominously for Israel:\n“I’d hate to be around when they face their comeuppance.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031879",
