Below is the letter I'm sending out to my friends and supporters, and at the\nbottom a message just for you....\n\n-Lisa\n\nThat you are receiving this letter means that you are among a special community of friends whose\nsupport— financial, moral, intellectual, logistical— has allowed my initiative, Poetry in America, to\nrealize what seemed, a year ago, almost certainly too ambitious a vision. That vision was to\nproduce the highest quality educational video on American poetry, creating a body of\nhumanities content capable of reaching a broad community of learners: formal and\ninformal, online and residential, young and old, American and international. And it was to\nbegin— rapidly— to disseminate and distribute our work.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029246",
