  "text": "over and over and over again while | was working. That afternoon, | told\nGod | couldn’ t believe in him any more because--even though he was\nsupposed to be a loving and all-powerful being--he had allowed such\ndevastation to happen. And then | heard the voice of God:\n\n“ALLOWED? WHY DO YOU THINK | GAVE HUMANS FREE WILL?”\n\n“Okay, well, I' m exercising my free will to believe that you don’ t\nexist.”\n\n“ALL RIGHT, PAL, IT’ S YOUR LOSS!”\n\nAt least we would remain on speaking terms. But | knew it was a\ngame. | enjoyed the paradox of developing a dialogue with a being whose\nreality now ranked with that of Santa Claus.
