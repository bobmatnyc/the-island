  "text": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\nthe Town Council’s power and authority, if persuaded, to look into an ordinance\nand suggested Mr. Maxey address it with them.\n\nB. Case # 08-2508, 227 Brazilian Ave., 2F, Hillen J. Smith\nViolation of Chapter 18, Section 18-241 of the Town of Palm Beach Code of\nOrdinances, building permits required to construct, install, repair or alter any\nbuilding or building system\n\nLead Code Enforcement Officer said Mr. Smith was found in violation, assessed\n$150.00 in administrative costs and given until July 16, 2008 to come into\ncompliance. Compliance has not been achieved so this is the time a fine would be\nassessed. Mr. Walton said the contractor was present to speak.\n\nSteve Pappanelli said he was hired by Mr. Smith after Mr. Smith had been cited\nand he was 90% complete with the job. He was just waiting on his final inspection\nand he should have it by next week but the building is closed to all construction\ninspections for two (2) weeks. Mr. Pappanelli said he was present on Mr. Smith’s\nbehalf to request a three (3) week extension. Mr. Walton said the Town did not\noppose the extension of time. Mr. Walton said the three weeks was necessary\nbecause the building would not let inspections be done while their maintenance\nman was on vacation. Mr. Walton said if compliance was not achieved by August\n7, 2008 then he would ask for a $250.00 a day fine to commence on August 8,\n2008.\n\nMs. Greenberg asked some questions about the type of permits and remarked that\nit is unfortunate in multi-family dwellings that this type of situation would exist to\nbegin with because electrical and plumbing can have catastrophic effects on other\nowners. She said it is unfortunate the people do not do the right thing until they\nget caught. Mr. Pappanelli said he was not the contractor working without\npermits.\n\nMOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME\nUNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO ASSESS\nA FINE OF $250.00, RETROACTIVE TO JULY 17, 2008 IF COMPLIANCE\nWAS NOT ACHIEVED\n\nSECONDED BY MS. GREENBERG\n\nDuring discussion on the motion, Ms. Duemler stated she believed the retroactive\nfine was a little harsh. Mr. Ballentine said he agreed and asked the reason for the\nretroactive fine. Mr. Ochstein said there are so many people who do work without\na permit and they know they need a permit. That is a very dangerous thing in a\nmulti-family dwelling and it should be egregious.\n\nMOTION BY MR. OCHSTEIN TO GRANT AN EXTENSION OF TIME\nUNTIL AUGUST 8, 2008 TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE AND TO\n\n16\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016569",
