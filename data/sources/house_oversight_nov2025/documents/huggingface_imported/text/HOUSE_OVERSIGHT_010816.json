So you tell me.\n\nI suggest to you that this is a calendar\nfrom December of 2000, since the next two months at\nthe top of the calendar are January 2001 and\nFebruary 2001. So let's assume that since it is a\npage from a calendar that appears to be December of\n2000, that it's December of 2000.\n\nThat would be a reasonable conclusion,\nwouldn't it?\n\nA.
