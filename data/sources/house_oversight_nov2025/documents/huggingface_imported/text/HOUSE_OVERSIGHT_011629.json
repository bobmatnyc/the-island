  "text": "armies: one-and-a-half million soldiers. Thousands of tanks. Hundreds of\nfighter jets. Other, much larger nations had endured months, even years, of hell\nbefore prevailing in such circumstances: the Soviet Union, for instance, with its\nhuge strategic depth, or France, rescued by its American-led allies, during\nWorld War Two.\n\nBut any pride in having prevailed was outweighed by simple relief Israel had\nsurvived. Even that was nothing compared to the sadness felt over friends lost,\nand the resentment and sense of betrayal toward the generals and political\nleaders who had failed to prepare the country for the surprise attacks, or the\ninitial confusion and dissension in some of our commanders’ response to the\nearly setbacks on the ground. Dozens of meetings were held in military units\nafter the war to talk about what had gone wrong. I was not the only young\nofficer to notice that the higher up the command chain they went, the more\nunedifying they became. After we’d heard one too many senior officer fine-\ntuning his account with each retelling, minimizing his share for the huge losses,\na new phrase entered Israeli army slang. Sipurei kravot — “battle stories” — were\nthe words usually used to describe a normal debriefing process. That expression\nwas now amended, to shipurei kravot. Battle improvements.\n\nI was assigned to convert my makeshift force into a regular armored training\nunit: Battalion 532, and that slightly delayed my reunion with Nava and Mikhal.\nBut in their absence, I found us a larger apartment in the Tel Aviv suburb of\nRamat Hasharon. Nava and I agreed that at the first opportunity, I’d return to\nCalifornia and we’d fly back together. I went at the end of the year. We bought\na refrigerator and a washing machine for the new flat — better models, and\ncheaper, than those available in Israel — and came home. Those few December\ndays in Palo Alto were a jumble of emotions. Happiness, at being back together.\nBut also a sobering sense, now that I was outside Israel for the first time since\nthe war, of the enormity of the threat we’d faced and the frustration and fear\nNava must have felt as we’d fought to defeat it. The year-end news\nretrospectives we watched on American TV were full of film clips from the first\nhours of the war, when it looked very possible we would lose. I remember being\nstruck by the thought that, if we had lost, if Israel had ceased to exist,\nceremonies of memorial and mourning would have been held across America,\nprobably in Stanford. But that once the shock and sadness had passed, Israel’s\ndisappearance would not have impinged on a single NFL Sunday, or delayed a\nsingle family shopping visit to J. C. Penny.\n\n158\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011629",
