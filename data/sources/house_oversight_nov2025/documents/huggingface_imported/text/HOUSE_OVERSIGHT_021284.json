  "text": "eliminates the possibility of the\nrefinements to religious views of human\nnature that the conversation between\nreligion and science can offer.\n\nConclusion\n\nMy argument has been that a\nrevived religious humanism can come\nabout through the dialogue between\nreligion and science, particularly\nbetween religion and the psychological\nsciences. I have illustrated this with the\nissue of love in Christianity. I believe\nmy argument could be illustrated with\nother religions, especially the Abrahamic\nreligions of Judaism and Islam. As\nAristotle’s influence created a kind of\nreligious humanism in these religions in\nthe past, the broader dialogue between\nscience and religion may be able to do\nthis for them in the future.\n\nBut the contributions will not\nsimply flow from science to religion.\nEven in this short essay, a question for\nscience to investigate has arisen. It is\nthis: how do religious and metaphysical\nbeliefs extend the impulse of natural kin\naltruism, if at all? This goes beyond the\nissue of the relation of religion to health.\nIt raises the question of the relation of\nreligion to expansive love for the distant\nother. This is a good question that\ncomes from taking the claims of religion\nseriously and an example of how\nreligion can continue to feed and\nchallenge scientific inquiry.\n\nReferences\n\n' Richard Dawkins, The God Delusion\n(Boston, Mass.: Houghton Mifflin Co.,\n2006); Daniel Dennett, Breaking the\nGod Spell (New York, NY.: Viking,\n2006); Sam Harris, Letter to a Christian\nNation (NY.; Alfred Knopf, 2006);\nChristopher Hitchens, God is not Great\n(NY.: Twelve, 2007).\n\nPage |38\n\n* For a discussion of these distinctions\nbetween different forms of\nphenomenology, see Paul Ricoeur,\nHermeneutics and the Human Sciences\n(Cambridge: Cambridge University\nPress, 1981), pp. 63-100.\n\n* Will Deming, Paul on Marriage and\nCelibacy (Cambridge: Cambridge\nUniversity Press, 1995).
