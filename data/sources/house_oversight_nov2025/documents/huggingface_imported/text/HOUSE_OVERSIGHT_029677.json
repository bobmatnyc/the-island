  "text": "Keating says: \"China must shift the basis of growth from net exports and investment to\ndomestic consumption. Will they achieve this? Probably. Will there be strains along the\nway? There have to be.\"\n\nUnlike many Australian leaders, Keating is a Europhile. \"I think the European project is\nthe most significant project since the second world war,\" he says. But he sees two huge\nblunders made in Europe.\n\nFrom the euro's inception, Keating said it should constitute only Germany, France and\nthe Benelux nations, not the peripheral countries around the Mediterranean, and \"Greece\nshould never have been allowed in\".\n\nWhy were the weaker economies given entry?\n\nKeating says: \"It's because president Mitterrand and the French wanted it. They weren't\nready to sit beside the German unified state without some friends.\"\n\nSo the eurozone was flawed from the outset, a structure awaiting internal assault: \"The\nproblem is we have a single currency without a political union and without a fiscal union.\"\n\nThe second blunder was the 1990s expansion of NATO to the Russian border. For\nKeating, this was recklessness for which the world may yet pay.\n\n\"Sensible policy would have included a place for Russia in the new world order,\" he says.\n\"But that didn't happen. So Russian liberals were pushed to one side by Russian\nnationalists. In a sense the US has created Vladimir Putin.\"\n\nWho is responsible? He points the finger at Bill Clinton.\n\nOn the 2008 financial crisis, he says former US Federal Reserve chief Alan Greenspan\nmust bear \"a fair amount of responsibility”.\n\n“Greenspan is someone | know and like,\" Keating says. \"But if you are so naive to believe\nthat institutions with a balance sheet with assets geared at 45 to one is not an accident\nwaiting to happen then you don't deserve to be chairman of the Federal Reserve.\"\n\nHe praises Obama for seeking a return to the \"liberal internationalism\" that, in Keating's\nview, made the US great in the post-World War Il age. This is the US he loves but it is still\nin retreat.\n\nAsked about the nature of leadership, Keating reveals what lies within his heart: \"I believe\nthere is a poetic strand to life that doesn't exist in an economics textbook.\n\n\"This is not to say that rationalism isn't important and good. It is. But left to itself without\nthe guidance of higher meaning and a higher concept, rationalism can be mean and\nincomplete. | say if you simply live on rational policy and briefing notes you are not\nsufficiently informed.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029677",
