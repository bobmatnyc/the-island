  "text": "in which Dan’s division was key in staunching the Egyptian advance in the first\ndays of the war, later inflicted heavy losses on one of Sadat’s armored forces\nand was part of the final push on the other side of the canal. And, of course,\nduring Entebbe. Dan had sharp tactical instincts, a belief in the importance of\nusing new technology to gain and sustain an edge, and an openness to\nunconventional approaches. Faced with a challenge in planning or executing an\noperation, he looked at it from all sides, determined to come up with the right\napproach, not always the expected one. In a lot of these ways, we were similar,\nwhich was no doubt one reason our relationship had grown closer as he and I —\nSix years younger, and a step or two behind — rose up the ranks.\n\nIn fact, Dan was the reason I’d made one of my rare forays into kirya politics\nnot long after Moshe Vechetzi took over as chief of staff, when Misha Arens was\nstill Defense Minister. I acted to derail what seemed to me a blatant attempt by\nMoshe to advance Drori’s and Amnon Lipkin’s prospects for eventual\nsuccession as chief-of-staff, and to take Dan out of the contest altogether.\n\nI was sitting at my desk on the third floor when the chief of internal army\nsecurity, an officer named Ben-Dor, walked into my office. “Listen,” he said,\n“the chief of staff has a right to give me a direct order in cases where he thinks\nthere is a need for a special investigation.

The whole thing stank, on every level, and not just because I\nwas confident the “rumors” were nonsense. “Look,” I said, “I have no idea\nwhether some sub-clause in army regulations allows the chief-of-staff to give\nyou orders over my head. But even if it does, I’m ordering you to do nothing\nuntil I talk to Moshe.” He nodded in agreement. In fact, he seemed relieved. He\nalso let me know that the source of the rumors was a number of senior officers,\nincluding a couple of generals.\n\nI went straight downstairs and into the chief-of-staff’s office. Moshe was at\nhis desk, smoking a cigarette. One of the advantages he had in being nearly a\nfoot taller than most of us was that I found myself looking not into his eyes, but\nup at them. “Moshe,” I said, “Ben-Dor told me you’ve ordered him to investigate\na rumor that Dan Shomron is a homosexual.” He said nothing. So I went on.\n“Tve told him not to do it. And ’ve come here to convince you that it’s\n\n219\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011690",
