Our conviction in this category is underscored by our proprietary\nconsumer survey, which shows that almost 20% of CBD users consume beverages,\nwhich we view as an encouraging sign. For 2019, we are forecasting a notable\nacceleration in growth, with revenues more than doubling to $600 mm. Assuming\ngrowth moderates in 2020 (to 50%), we believe revenues will approach the $1 bn mark.\n\nFigure 57 Sales for Beverages Can Approach $1 BN Over the Next Two Years\n\n$1,000 Total Beverage CBD Sales ($ inmm) $900\n\n$800\n$600\n\n$600\n\n$400\n\n$200\n\nSO\n\n2018 2019 2020\nMBottled Water MEnergy Drinks Beer\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nBelow we provide a sub-segment build by category, where we believe CBD water will\nrepresent the lion’s share of sales at 65%. Energy drinks have been focused on health\nand wellness and we believe that CBD-infused energy drinks will represent a niche\nsegment in a category that continues to see more competition. We expect CBD beer to\nhave a place in the category, though should admittedly be smaller in scale, given less\ninterest from a lack of THC.\n\nFigure 58 CBD Water Should Have An Outsized Contribution On Category Sales\n\nCBD Sales Mix by Sub-Category\n\nBeer\n15%\n\nEnergy Drinks\n20%\n\nBottled Water\n65%\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nCOWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024854",
