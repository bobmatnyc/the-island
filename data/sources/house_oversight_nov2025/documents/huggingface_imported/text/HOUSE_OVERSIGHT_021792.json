  "text": "In short, Reiter told the county's top prosecutor for the past 13 years that he ought to get off the case. \"It looks\nlike a departure from professionalism,\" Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle said of\nReiter's letter.\n\nFollowing Epstein's indictment, Reiter referred the case to the FBI to determine whether the super-rich, super-\nconnected defendant had violated any federal laws.\n\nReiter won't discuss the case or the broadsides aimed at him. But others almost uniformly use one word to\ndescribe the chief: professional.\n\n\"I have always been impressed by Mike's professionalism and his leadership,\" said Rick Lincoln, chief of the\nLantana Police Department and a Palm Beach County cop for 32 years.\n\n\"The town of Palm Beach has a very professional police department. We all consider Mike to be our peer and a\nman of integrity.\"\n\nJuno Beach Police Chief H.C. Clark Il agreed. Although he doesn't know Reiter well, he has met with him on\ncountywide law enforcement issues. \"I've never seen him lose his cool. I've never seen anything but a\nprofessional demeanor from him.\"\n\nReiter joined the Palm Beach Police Department in 1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year patrol job at the University\nof Pittsburgh. His personnel jacket shows consistently excellent job evaluations.\n\nPosh Palm Beach is no hotbed of crime, and in his first year on the job, a resident confined to his home with a\nsick child thanked Reiter for delivering a few Cokes to the house. Reiter refused payment for the beverages.\nAnother resident thanked Reiter for shutting off his car's headlights in his driveway, saying a valet must have\nbeen at fault.\n\nReiter worked everything from road patrol to organized crime, vice and narcotics. And he's no novice at\ninvestigations involving the island's rich and famous. He was the lead detective probing the drug overdose\ndeath of David Kennedy in 1984. He also was one of the officers who worked the investigation of William\nKennedy Smith, who was charged in 1991 — and later acquitted — with raping a woman at the Kennedy\nfamily compound in Palm Beach.\n\nReiter, who has a master's degree in human resource development from Palm Beach Atlantic University, also\nhas attended the FBI National Academy in Quantico, Va., and management courses at Harvard. He's been\nactive in countywide interagency law enforcement organizations and has a \"top secret\" national security\nclearance.\n\n\"He has a perspective that's broader than just addressing the needs of the town,\" said Town Manager Peter\nElwell, who promoted Reiter from assistant chief to chief in March 2001. Reiter makes more than $144,000 as\nthe town's top cop. Elwell thinks he's worth it.\n\n\"He's very businesslike, very straightforward. He's not easily agitated or flamboyant. He's about the work,\"\nElwell said. \"I think that his service as chief has been outstanding in five-plus years.\"\n\nDe ee ee ee ee ee ee ee i ee a\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
