  "text": "girls.\n\nProsecutors did not pursue charges against Mr. Epstein reflecting the age of the victims\nbecause they assumed a jury would view the girls not as victims but as promiscuous,\nuntrustworthy, willing participants. The presumption is offensive.\n\nMr. Epstein, a 53-year-old Manhattan money manager who has hired Harvard law\nprofessor Alan Dershowitz and defense attorney Jack Goldberger, has denied knowing\nhow old the girls were. But police interviews with five alleged victims and 17 witnesses\nunder oath, as well as phone messages, a high school transcript and other items that\npolice found from searching Mr. Epstein's trash and 7,234-square-foot waterfront home,\nprovide evidence that he knew the girls were teenagers.\n\nOne girl couldn't show up when Mr. Epstein wanted because she had soccer. Another\ntime, Mr. Epstein had to wait for his \"massage\" session because the girl he wanted was\nstill in class.\n\nWhy didn't State Attorney Barry Krischer let a jury decide whether to believe the\nteenagers - including a 16-year-old who went to Mr. Epstein's house to \"work\" in\nDecember 2004 after being asked whether she needed to make money for Christmas\ngifts?\n\nProsecutors gave greater weight to the details Mr. Dershowitz provided about the girls in\nan apparent effort to assail their character. Mr. Dershowitz pointed out to prosecutors that\nsome of the teenagers had talked on myspace.com about marijuana and alcohol use.\n\nThe 20-year-old Royal Palm Beach woman who told police she recruited girls for Mr.\nEpstein has a Web page on myspace.com that features one girl using the name \"Pimpin'\nMade EZ.\"\n\nAlthough no charges of witness tampering have been filed, the parents of at least one of\nthe teenage victims complained to police of being followed and intimidated by two men.\nPolice determined that their vehicles were registered to two private investigators. Mr.\nGoldberger denied knowing anything about it.\n\nPolice also note in their reports that the state attorney's office offered Mr. Epstein a plea\ndeal that would have placed him on probation for five years, allowing him ultimately to\nwalk away with no criminal record at all.\n\nI asked Mr. Krischer's spokesman, Mike Edmondson, why the case was referred to a\ngrand jury instead of Mr. Epstein being charged and facing a trial before a jury. And\nshouldn't the victims' credibility be a factor to determine whether a crime's been\ncommitted, not whether a jury will convict? (After all, as Mr. Goldberger told The Palm\nBeach Post of Mr. Epstein, \"He's never denied girls came to the house.\")\n\nEspecially, I asked Mr. Edmondson to explain: Why shouldn't the public look at this case\nand think there are two kinds of justice - one for the wealthy and one for the rest of us?\nMr. Edmondson said he could not comment on the case because it is active, but on the\nlatter point, he offered, for the sake of \"philosophical debate\": \"Whether wealth buys a\ndifferent standard of justice across the country ... the answer to that would, of course, be\n\nyes.\n\nBut in this case, he said, \"regardless of the battery of attorneys, the outcome would be the\n\n\"\n\nsame. Every issue that was debated in public was debated in our office before this case\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021765",
