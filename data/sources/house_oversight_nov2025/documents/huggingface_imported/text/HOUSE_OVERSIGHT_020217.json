While Snowden may have believed such results\nwould elevate him, the NSA’s offer did not meet his expectations. “It was totally unrealistic for\nSnowden to expect to get a SES position,” a former senior NSA officer told me. Snowden\nambitions may have been disappointed in this instance, but it did not prevent him from later\nclaiming that he had been a senior adviser to the CIA and also a senior adviser to the Defense\nIntelligence Agency.\n\nInstead of an SES position, the NSA offered a lowly G-13 job as an information technology\nworker, which was not an improvement on his job at Dell. He took this slight as evidence of the\nNSA’s incompetence, subsequently joking to a reporter in Moscow that his ability to steal the test\nanswers should have been seen as a qualification for the NSA job. In September 2012, he turned\ndown the NSA offer. If he was to advance himself now, he had to find a new way.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020217",
