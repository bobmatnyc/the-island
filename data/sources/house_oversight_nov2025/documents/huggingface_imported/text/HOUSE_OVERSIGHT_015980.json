This is a great deal better — if you enjoy watching sport or nature\ndocumentaries, the additional resolution is amazing. This still falls far\nshort of reality. An IMAX theatre gives a wrap-around image of about\n10,000 by 7,000 pixels and comes closer to the average resolution of the\nhuman eye, estimated at about 30,000 by 20,000 pixels. But the eye cheats.\nIt concentrates the rods and cones in the central portion of the retina.\nAlthough IMAX achieves the average pixel density of your eye, it comes\nnowhere near the peak density which is nearly 10,000 times greater.\n\nFor a truly equivalent experience, we would need about 320 million\npixels per eye at a frame rate of 120 frames per second, allowing us full\nstereo synthesis. At this speed and resolution, we are matching the visual\nacuity of the eye and should be able to fool it completely. But there is\none more problem to overcome: The image is not interactive. Move your\nhead in the real world and the image will change. The objects in the\nforeground will vary their position in relation to the background, so-\ncalled motion parallax. Try it now, move your head and you will see that\nthe book, or screen you are reading moves in relation to the background.\nIn a simple digitized 3D image this will not happen. You will have a 3D\nimage but you will not have a real image, a light field.\n\nTo create a real image you need to view a hologram or use head-\ntracking technology. A hologram records the light waves given off by\nan object in multiple directions rather than just the intensity of the light\nstriking the camera through a single focal point. When you shine a laser\nback through the hologram, it regenerates the light waves as they would\nhave originally come from the object. That light can be viewed from\ndifferent directions, giving the impression of three dimensions rather\nthan a mere two-dimensional photograph. There is often a limitation in\nviewing angle because the original photographic plate must wrap all the\nway around an object to capture the full 3D light field, but the illusion is\nvery convincing.\n\nA more effective way to create a real experience — and one with no\nrestriction on viewing angle — is to construct the image in a computer\nand track the movement of your head. The computer can create the\ntwo-dimensional images each eye would see if the scene were truly\nthree-dimensional. Computer software resolves motion parallax and a\nhost of other elements, but to do so the computer must understand a\nmodel of the world so it can calculate how the scene would look from a\nparticular angle and in the appropriate lighting. Some recent games such\nas Activision's ‘Call of Duty’ do this, and the experience is compelling.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015980",
