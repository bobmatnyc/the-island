  "text": "There is another useful inference. Adults own assets in the business and housing\nsectors. Older adults tend more to own debt claims on these sectors, and younger\nadults to own equity claims. But all adult ages collectively own both sectors\ncollectively. It does not follow that the sectors are equal in risk, as older individuals\nmight tend to own one sector predominantly, and younger ones the other. As a\n\nlayman, I don’t really know.\n\nWhat I happen to know is that the publicly traded corporate sector, meaning stocks\nparticularly but also bonds, is far more liquid than the housing sector, and that the\nrest of the business sector is far less liquid than either. Risk in general includes\nliquidity risk. This leads me to the hypothesis or hunch that the housing sector in\ngeneral should be safer than the business sector, ceteris paribus, but that the\npublicly traded corporate sector, cap-weighting debt and equity claims on it, may be\n\nsafest of all.\n\nThe idea that stocks and bonds cap-weighted are safer than houses might have been\nlaughed to scorn a few years ago. It doesn’t seem so funny after 2008. I view it as an\nidea to be tested, not trusted, until more is known. If it holds up, it will rank as\n\nanother surprise.\n\nThe effect of individual wealth on risk tolerance is less understood. Here I judge\nmore from hunch and impression than from data. Given that human needs are fairly\nuniform, as with the private and the general, more wealth gives more insulation\nfrom want. Talent is wealth in human capital, and gives the same. Less, in either\nfactor, gives less margin for error. My hunch and impression is that the wealthier in\neither factor should tend to be more risk tolerant so long as human capital itself is\nnot put in harm’s way. Human capital operates physical capital, and gives the means\nof recovery. The wealthier, in talent or net worth, should prove the least tempted\n\ntoward sky diving and Russian roulette.\n\nChapter 2: Fast Forward 1/06/16 26\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010966",
