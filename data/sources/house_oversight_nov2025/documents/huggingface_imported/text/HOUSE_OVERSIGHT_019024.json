BEACH POLICE DEPARTMEN , Page: 71\nTime: 9:27:55 Incident Report Program: CMS301L\nCase No. . . . : 1-05-000368 (Continued)\n\nDuring a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed\nby Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months. He was referred by\nassociates and his employment lasted the months of November 2004\nthrough May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included\nbeing the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr.\nEpstein and provide for Epstein's guests. Rodriguez advised he had\nvery limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a\nmessage to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary\n\"Leslie\" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal\nassistant, [BBB who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez\nstated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in\nresidence.\n\nI asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in\nPalm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked\nspecifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he\nwould have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the\nmorning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.\nRodriguez stated he would_be informed to expect someone and make them\ncomfortable until either or Epstein would meet with them.\n\nRodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them\n\nentry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.\n\nThey would then be encountered by either MJ or Epstein. They\n\nwould be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if\n\nany of the masseuses appeared young in age. He advised he didn't ask\n\ntheir ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate\n\nlike his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they\n\nwould eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time.. Rodriguez\n\nstated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be\n\nmasseuses. He stated one time under Epstein's direction, he delivered\n\na dozen roses top TT for one of the girls b6\n\nthat came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high bic\n\nschool and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the\n_Massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.\n\nHe would clean Mr. Epstein's bedroom after the alleged massages and\n\nwould discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor.\n\nHe also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put\n\nthem away in an armoire. He described the armoire as a small wood\n\narmoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.\n\nEpstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a\ncar for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive\nher self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl\nalways needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself\nas a \"human ATM machine\" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a\nminimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times. When a girl\nwould come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or\nwas not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl\n(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify\nEpstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019024",
