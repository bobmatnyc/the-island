At one point he counted among his friends former President Bill Clinton, Donald Trump and other high-powered figures.\n \nThe appeal court decision described the background of Epstein's case, stating that in 2006, the Federal Bureau of Investigation \"began investigating allegations that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused several minor girls.\"\n \nIn September 2007, federal prosecutors struck the non-prosecution deal with Epstein, but didn't tell the victims, court filings say.\n \n   Photos: Crimes that shocked South Florida   \n\n \n\"Not only did the United States neglect to confer with the victims before it entered into the agreement with Epstein, it also failed to notify them of its existence for at least nine months,\" Circuit Judge William H. Pryor wrote in the appeals court decision.\n \nIn June 2008, Epstein pleaded guilty to a state charge of procuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution and was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He spent 13 months behind bars, and is registered as a sex offender in Florida.\n \nThe situation also resulted in civil suits being filed against Epstein, who according to media reports settled claims from about two dozen young women who alleged he paid them for sexual massages at his Palm Beach mansion, some as young as 14, according to media reports.\n \nTo the attorneys who represent the Jane Does 1 and 2, the sentence was much lighter than the years, or possibly decades, that Epstein could've spent behind bars had he been prosecuted in the federal system.\n \nThey're hoping that the correspondence, ordered released by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals, will shed light on what they say is an unusually lenient deal.\n \n\"I can say that I've been teaching criminal law for more than two decades and I have never seen a plea agreement as lenient as this one, for hands-on sex offenders,\" said Cassell, who is based in Salt Lake City.\n \nBut one of Epstein's attorney's, Martin Weinberg, based in Boston, disputed those characterizations. Weinberg said Monday that the plea agreement was \"reached in good faith\" and that \"it's not a fair conclusion\" to describe the agreement as either improper or tainted by Epstein's wealth.\n \n\"It's Mr. Cassell's hope that this correspondence may support that theory, but the reality is that the U.S. Attorney's Office made a responsible judgment in how to implement the law,\" Weinberg said.\n \nWeinberg said he was concerned about the potential impact the ruling would have on the ability of criminal defense attorneys and prosecutors to communicate confidentially.\n \nHe also said he and Epstein co-counsel, Miami criminal defense attorney Roy Black, will ask the Atlanta-based appeals court to review the decision.\n \nAs for the Jane Does, who are now over 18, it's just the latest development in a long legal saga, another one of their attorneys said.\n \n\"They're pretty numb at this point to favorable news because they've heard this before and nothing's happened,\" said Fort Lauderdale attorney Brad Edwards.\n \nEdwards and Cassel said their goal is to have Epstein's plea agreement deemed to be in violation of federal victims' rights legislation and invalidated. Edwards said Epstein should face a new prosecution.\n \nEdwards also said he was first told by the U.S. Attorney's Office that he would receive the correspondence documents on Monday, but was then told that they weren't ready yet. Cassell said the documents number 500 pages.\n \nIn an email, Annette Castillo, spokeswoman for the U.S. Attorney's Office, Southern District of Florida, said the office couldn't comment.\n \nbsclarkson@tribune.com, 561-243-6609 or Twitter @BrettClarkson_\n  \n  \n \n \nCopyright © 2014, South Florida Sun-Sentinel\n \nfl-jeffrey-epstein-federal-court-of-appeals-20140421 \n\n \n\n\n  \n \n Upload a photo of Mom for a chance to win $200 \n \n \n  \n• print \n  \n•  \n\n  \n \n•   \n \n\n\n\n \n \n« Previous StoryMore Palm Beach County News: Local breaking news, events, info and updates for Palm Beach County and its surrounding citiesNext Story »\n  \n•  \nBail set at $600,000 for ex-West Palm pain doctor charged in overdose deaths Bail set at $600,000 for ex-West Palm pain doctor charged in overdose deaths\n\n \n•  \nBoca Raton Children's Museum needs the city's helping hand Boca Raton Children's Museum needs the city's helping hand\n\n \n\n\n \n \n\n  \n \n\n \n \n We've upgraded our reader commenting system.
