Each of\nthese factors individually has a direct impact on the level of risk and the potential for returns in\nthe healthcare technology sector. However, the positive trends in all of them occurring at the\nsame time should create a uniquely positive environment to execute NLV-II]’s targeted strategy\nwithin the sector.\n\nINVESTMENT STRATEGY\n\nNew Leaf’s investment strategy is differentiated in the venture capital industry in terms of its\nsector focus, specific approaches within each sector, and the depth of experience and long-term\ntrack record that supports each element of the strategy. The Fund’s primary focus will be on\ninvestments in the Biopharmaceutical and Information Convergence sectors, with a secondary\nfocus on Medical Devices and Biological Research Tools & Infrastructure. Investments will\nbe predominantly in the U.S., but could include a small number of investments in other parts of\nthe world (e.g., Western Europe or Canada). The focus within each sector will be the following:\n\nBiopharmaceuticals: As in NLV-I and NLV-II, biopharmaceutical investments will be the core\nfocus for NLV-III and will comprise approximately 50% - 60% of the Fund. The Fund will\ntypically invest in development stage and commercial stage private companies and in publicly\ntraded small capitalization companies where the investments will be made mostly through\nstructured transactions. The portfolio will emphasize companies developing targeted\ntherapeutics that address molecular mechanisms of disease, where validated biomarkers can be\nutilized to positively bias probabilities of success and reduce time and cost of development\ncompared to historical averages. These companies exemplify some of the key characteristics the\nFund Managers seek across the portfolio - namely large, unmet medical needs, strong science,\nwell differentiated technologies and high quality pre-clinical and clinical development\nprograms led by experienced management teams.\n\nThe Fund Managers believe that NLV-III will have the opportunity to invest in compelling\nbiopharmaceutical opportunities and that these will have attractive risk-return profiles for a\nnumber of reasons, including the following:\n\ne For the past decade, biopharmaceutical companies have been shifting their research and\ndevelopment focus towards products that target mechanisms of disease at the molecular\nlevel. Clinical programs for these types of products are typically smaller, more capital\nefficient and have higher probabilities of success. These improvements are achievable\nbecause precise biomarker testing enables a focus on only those patients where the\nspecific molecular mechanism is known to play an important role in the disease process.\nBy including only these patients in the clinical programs for these targeted products, the\nprobability of detecting critical efficacy signals is significantly increased, even with\nrelatively small numbers of patients;\n\ne Targeted development programs are benefiting from an improving regulatory\nenvironment, as the FDA is demonstrating clear interest in working constructively with\n\ncompanies to bring these types of high-impact therapeutics to market more quickly and\nefficiently. This spirit of cooperation was covered thoughtfully in a recent New England\n\n6 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024017",
