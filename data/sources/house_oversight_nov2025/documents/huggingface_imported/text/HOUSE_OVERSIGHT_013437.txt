Jeffrey Epstein 'kept a diary of his under-aged victims'

The Duke of York’s billionaire paedophile friend kept a secret journal, described as “The Holy Grail”
by lawyers, which listed his alleged under-aged victims and the celebrity guests he entertained at his
Florida mansion.

Jeffrey Epstein used the “black book” to log contact details of the girls that gave massages to him and his friends and those
of his powerful and famous associates, such as Bill Clinton and Donald Trump.

A servant at the £4 million manor in Palm Beach, where Prince Andrew enjoyed daily massages during several stays, stole
the journal and initially kept it secret from investigators. He is now in prison after attempting to sell it for $50,000 (£31,000).

Epstein, 58, was accused of sex offences by more than 20 under-aged girls. They alleged that after being recruited as

masseuses by aides including Ghislaine Maxwell, daughter of the late tycoon Robert, they were seriously assaulted and
then paid hundreds of dollars.
