  "text": "Does God have\nFree Will?\n\nGod. Scientists generally avoid the topic, but since we’re talking\nabout such a fundamental concept, we must consider whether\nthe Universe would be any different if it had a creator.\n\nRecently there have been two widely publicized attacks on religious\nbelief from the scientific community: the head-on attack from Richard\nDawkins in The God Delusion or, the hard hitting sideswipe by Stephen\nHawking in The Universe in a Nutshell.\n\nHawking made the front pages in 2000 with the statement: “There\nis then no need for a creator” He was considering whether God needed\nto ignite the Big Bang or if it occurred as a natural result of the laws of\nphysics. Hawking had run the mathematics and realized a god was not\nneeded to light the blue touch paper for the Big Bang - the laws of physics\nspontaneously caused it. His argument does not actually preclude the\nexistence of a god, but it does move the point where we need a creator\none step further up the chain.\n\nThis is not a fundamental change to the progress of theological\nargument over the last thousand years. Once we abandon our vision\nof God as a master builder, literally breathing life into Adam while\nputting the finishing touches to the Garden of Eden, we can move him\nup the causal chain as far as we like, eventually reaching a point where\nintervention is necessary to get things started. Hawking is only pointing\nout an intervention is not needed at the point of the Big Bang. It still begs\n\nA ny discussion of free will is incomplete without some mention of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016029",
