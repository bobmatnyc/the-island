  "text": "that acute loneliness, just like acute\nphysical pain, serves an important\nbiological function for our species.\nBeing aware of how loneliness fits into\nour remarkable achievements as a social\nspecies and what loneliness does to our\nsocial cognition and behavior can help\nus better understand the actions of others\ntoward us. Third, to the extent that\ndesperation for social connections leads\nchronically lonely individuals to\nmisguidedly vest their interest in those\nwho are unlikely to meet their\nrelationship needs, they may need to\nlearn how to be selective and choose\nfriends and groups with whom\nreciprocally rewarding relationships can\nbe expected. This decision is critical to\nsuccess. Research indicates that the\npeople with whom we are most likely to\nform positive, lasting relationships are\nthose who have similar attitudes, beliefs,\nvalues, interests, and activities to our\nown. Therefore, people should not seek\nfriendships based on physical\nappearance, status, popularity, or\nconvenience, but rather on attitudes,\nbeliefs, values, and behaviors. Finally,\nbecause chronically lonely people expect\nto be disappointed with themselves and\nothers in their relationships, they may\nbenefit from training and practice in\ntaking a more optimistic perspective, in\nexpecting the best from themselves and\nfrom others. We play a much more\nimportant role in shaping our social\nenvironment than we often realize.\n\nAlthough no intervention to date\nhas incorporated all of these elements, at\nleast one randomized trial has\ndemonstrated that an intervention based\nupon volunteerism (Experience Corps)\ncan increase social activity in older\nadults (19). In this trial, older adults are\npaired with grade-school children and\ndedicate at least fifteen hours per week\n\n135\n\nPage\n\nthroughout the school year to assist the\nteachers in supporting and encouraging\nchildren in reading, writing, and\nmathematics. This strategy engages at\nleast two of the principles that emerged\nout of Cacioppo and Patrick’s theoretical\nframework (5)—the provision of a\n“safe” venue for making social\nconnections (i.e., the classroom of non-\nthreatening children), and the shifting of\nolder adults’ attention away from their\nown concers and toward the needs of\nsomeone else. In addition, this strategy\ncapitalizes on Erikson’s notion of\ngenerativity (1.e., helping future\ngenerations) (20). Interventions of this\nform deserve further assessment (21).\n\nConclusion\n\nWe began this chapter by noting\nthat loneliness is not uncommon and,\nalthough unpleasant, may prompt\nindividuals to attend to and repair their\nsocial connections. Loneliness affects\ncognition as well as well-being,\nhowever, and when loneliness persists it\nis a risk factor for myriad health\nproblems. Previous reviewers have\nsuggested that loneliness can be reduced\nthrough interventions that emphasize\nsocial skills development and group-\nbased activities. By quantitatively\nanalyzing twenty-two well-designed\nstudies, we found no evidence that these\nstrategies were any more effective in\nreducing loneliness than increasing\nsocial opportunities or social support, or\nmodifying maladaptive social\ncognitions, whether in a group or\nindividual context. A larger number of\nintervention studies may be needed to\ndetermine the relative efficacy of these\nintervention strategies. In the interim, it\nis clear from this review that global\nimpressions and intuitions will not\nsuffice when trying to reduce loneliness.\nFuture interventions should\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021381",
