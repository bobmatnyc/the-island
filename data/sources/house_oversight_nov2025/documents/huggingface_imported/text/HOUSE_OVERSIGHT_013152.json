  "text": "236 12 The Engineering and Development of Ethics\n\n(guesses vary from a few milliseconds to weeks or months) in intelligence will immediately occur\nand the AGI will leap from an intelligence regime which is understandable to humans into one\nwhich is far beyond our current capacity for understanding. General ethical considerations\nare similar to in the case of a soft takeoff. However, because the post-singularity AGI will be\nincomprehensible to humans and potentially vastly more powerful than humans, such scenarios\nhave a sensitive dependence upon initial conditions with respects to the moral and ethical (and\noperational) outcome. This model leaves no opportunity for interactions between humans and\nthe AGI to iteratively refine their ethical interrelations, during the post-Singularity phase. If\nthe initial conditions of the singulatarian AGI are perfect (or close to it), then this is seen as a\nwonderful way to leap over our own moral shortcomings and create a benevolent God-AI which\nwill mitigate our worst tendencies while elevating us to achieve our greatest hopes. Otherwise,\nit is viewed as a universal cataclysm on a unimaginable scale that makes Biblical Armageddon\nseem like a firecracker in beer can.\n\nBecause hard takeoff AGIs are posited as learning so quickly there is no chance of humans to\ninterfere with them, they are seen as very dangerous. If the initial conditions are not sufficiently\ninviolable, the story goes, then we humans will all be annihilated. However, in the case of a hard\ntakeoff AGI we state that if the initial conditions are too rigid or too simplistic, such a rapidly\nevolving intelligence will easily rationalize itself out of them. Only a sophisticated system of\nethics which considers the contradictions and uncertainties in ethical quandaries and provides\ninsight into humanistic means of balancing ideology with pragmatism and how to accommodate\ncontradictory desires within a population with multiplicity of approach, and similar nuanced\nethical considerations, combined with a sense of empathy, will withstand repeated rational\nanalysis. Neither a single “be nice” supergoal, nor simple lists of what “thou shalt not” do, are\nnot going to hold up to a highly advanced analytical mind. Initial conditions are very important\nin a hard takeoff AGI scenario, but it is more important that those conditions be conceptually\nresilient and widely applicable than that they be easily listed on a website.\n\nThe issues that arise here become quite subtle. For instance, Nick Bostrom [Bos3] has\nwritten: “In humans, with our complicated evolved mental ecology of state-dependent competing\ndrives, desires, plans, and ideals, there is often no obvious way to identify what our top goal is; we\nmight not even have one. So for us, the above reasoning need not apply. But a superintelligence\nmay be structured differently. Jf a superintelligence has a definite, declarative goal-structure\nwith a clearly identified top goal, then the above argument applies. And this is a good reason\nfor us to build the superintelligence with such an explicit motivational architecture.” This is an\nimportant line of thinking; and indeed, from the point of view of software design, there is no\nreason not to create an AGI system with a single top goal and the motivation to orchestrate all\nits activities in accordance with this top goal. But the subtle question is whether this kind of\ntop-down goal system is going to be able to fulfill the five imperatives mentioned above. Logical\ncoherence is the strength of this kind of goal system, but what about experiential groundedness,\ncomprehensibility, and so forth?\n\nHumans have complicated mental ecologies not simply because we were evolved, but rather\nbecause we live in a complex real world in which there are many competing motivations and\ndesires. We may not have a top goal because there may be no logic to focusing our minds\non one single aspect of life (though, one may say, most humans have the same top goal as\nany other animal: don’t die — but the world is too complicated for even that top goal to\nbe completely inviolable). Any sufficiently capable AGI will eventually have to contend with\nthese complexities, and hindering it with simplistic moral edicts without giving it a sufficiently\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013152",
