  "text": "build the suspense, before completing her sentence “‘ To go dancing with\na Prince of England this evening”. Hoping it would be one of the younger\ngenerations, I was disappointed when she told me he was the Duke of\nYork, Charles’s younger brother Andrew. I looked at her with a fake\nsurprised look, one I had to use on many occasions in my time with them,\nto give an impression of excitement. ““What...wow!” I exclaimed with my\ngifted acting ability. It is a sad realization but I had grown more\naccustomed to seeing people for their significance rather than the good\nqualities they possessed, and was able to grin & bear the thought of what\nI expected lay in store for me.\n\nGhislane and | left shortly thereafter for the many lanes of designer\nshops to choose from in London. Her pep talks to prepare me for my\nduties towards royalty went on and on, giving me the obscure impression\nI was something of importance, at least for more than an evening. “Make\nsure your bubbly and energetic, nobody want’s a dead horse” was one of\nthe cheap tools she instilled me with. “Who knows where this could lead\nfor you” was another. As the day grew shorter my anxiety only\nheightened, anticipating the Prince’s arrival and unable to decide on an\noutfit, I picked out three. Our last stop for the day was Burberry’s for a\nnice handbag to compliment our chosen attire. We got back to her\ntownhouse with still a couple hours spare to get ready. After trying on all\nthree outfits and many mental debates with myself later, I decided on the\npink mini-tee and dazzling pair of denims with horses embroidered into a\npattern. It seemed a lot more my style and age group rather than the other\ntwo older looking sophisticated dresses I had picked out. I told myself I\nwas going dancing at a club not to an opera. As most young girls can be\nduring their body changes into womanhood, I felt awkward, you know,\nbig feet, freckles and body hair in unwanted places. They’re things you\njust don’t want when your seventeen and then you see these iconic\nbillboards of what femininity is supposed to represent and just don’t fit\ninto that picture, never feeling what we all are already... absolutely\nperfect. By the time I had got ready I was a nervous wreck, but trying to\nkeep my cool on the outside was an act. I thought it’d be a good idea to\ntake a few Xanax before the evening unraveled and my anxiety went\nthrough the roof.\n\nJeffrey and I were sitting in the lounge room downstairs, waiting for\nGhislane to finish getting ready. The room was silent, only stillness in the\nair. I stared at the mural painted onto the wall that I was facing. It was an\ninteresting piece of artwork. In great detail it illustrated a happy looking\nfamily sitting on a bench overlooking a pond that resided on a large piece\nof land with a beautiful home displayed. There were also hunting hounds\nand the hunters chasing a game of fox like the notorious “English Hunt\nPieces” throughout history. Jeffrey took notice of my enchantment into\n\n75\n\n0 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004208\n\nthe picture and in a hushed voice proceeded to tell me that it was a\nportrait of Ghislane’s childhood, the part she could be proud of. [ never\nrealized how prominent her family’s history was in England, apparently\nas to Jeffrey’s attest, her Father was born of poor Jewish decent in\nCzechoslovakia, most of his family being killed upon Nazi invasion in\n1939. Fleeing to join the British Army as a young man, he changed his\nname a few times and made a lot of contacts in the field. After the war, a\nnewfound Robert Maxwell went into publishing using his army contacts\nto establish a business initially built upon publishing scientific books\nfrom occupied Germany. In time, Maxwell acquired several British\nnewspapers, among them the Daily Mirror, countering his wits against\nthe likes of Rupert Murdoch along the way. However, whilst constructing\nhis publishing empire, Maxwell compiled astronomical debts, and his\nequivocal financial dealings attracted the attention of governing\nauthorities that judged him not to be looking out for his companies best\ninterest and in the end it transpired that Robert Maxwell had been using\nproceeds from his employees pension funds to meet his financial debts,\nruining the futures of thousands of employees. Once an esteemed\nMember of Parliament and publishing mogul, Robert’s body was found\nfloating in the Atlantic Ocean after he was found to be missing from his\nyacht, the Lady Ghislane (named after his favorite child), whilst cruising\nthe Canary Islands in 1991. Jeffrey went on to tell me that when her\nFather died she was inconsolable, and in a very bad state. He picked her\nup from the trenches of despair and took her under his wing, and it’s there\nshe has stayed comfortable ever since. To Ghislane his peculiar need to\nhave so many woman around and even his taste in younger than legal\none’s didn’t seem unconventional to her. It was her own Father who was\ndeemed a womanizer and even took a second wife whilst still married to\nGhislane’s mother. | would have never guessed this carefree, spirited, and\nvivacious woman had ever endured such sorrows. I couldn’t help but look\nat her in a different light from then on, but not letting her know that I\nknew, to avoid any altercations between us.\n\nLike clockwork Ghislane came downstairs five minutes before Prince\nAndrew were to atrive, wearing a tight-fitted white wooly turtleneck\nsinglet and a nice pair of loose fitting trousers. Looking elegant and\ncasual at the same time, a very hard look to achieve but one Ghislane had\nalways easily mastered. They both seemed at ease poking fun at my\nobvious nervous state, just another ordinary night out for this\nextraordinary couple. The knock came at the door just after six o’clock in\nthe evening. Ghislane greeted him and the guard who would wait for his\nreturn in the car. She led him down the hall to where Jeffrey and I were\nsitting. We both stood up and Jeffrey shook his hand, while Ghislane\nproceeded to introduce me and as I was taught by her was English\n\n76\n\n( Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUPFREQO4209\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021182",
