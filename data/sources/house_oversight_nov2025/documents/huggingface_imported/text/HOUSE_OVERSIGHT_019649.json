It could also account for\nwhy the documents he copied that pertained to NSA operations in\nRussia were not among those he gave to Poitras, Greenwald, and\nother journalists. Because Russia has had an active intelligence-\nsharing treaty with China since 1996, it could further explain why\nhis first stop was Hong Kong, a part of China. It was a safe venue for\ndebriefing Snowden, as well as establishing his credentials among\njournalists as a whistle-blower, before a decision was made to allow\nhim to proceed to Russia.\n\nThe nearly fatal problem with this early recruitment scenario is\nSnowden’s contacts with journalists. Snowden, it will be recalled,\nhad contacted Greenwald in December 2012. Greenwald was a high-\nprofile blogger in Brazil who did not use encryption or any security\nsafeguards. Next, he contacted Poitras in January 2013 in Berlin;\nshe was a magnet for NSA dissidents. Both of these contacts put\n\n© Snowden’s clandestine downloading at grave risk. As known oppo- ©\nnents of U.S. intelligence agencies, these journalists might be, as they\nthemselves suspected they were, under surveillance by American,\nBritish, Brazilian, or German intelligence services. Greenwald and\nPoitras might also tell others who were either under surveillance or\ninformers. So no matter what precautions Snowden took, his secret\nenterprise, or just the fact he was in contact with anti-government\nactivists, might be detected. At minimum, he could lose his access to\nsecrets and be of no further use as a source at the NSA. He could also\nbe interrogated and reveal the way he was brought under control. If\nSnowden had actually been under the control of the Russian intel-\nligence service, the last thing it would allow was for him to take such\na risk—or even to contact a single journalist. After all, the purpose\nof an espionage operation is to steal secrets without alerting anyone\nto the theft.\n\nA former CIA officer told me that while anything could “go hay-\nwire” in an intelligence operation, it would be “unthinkable” that\nthe Russian intelligence service would permit an undercover source\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 161 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019649",
