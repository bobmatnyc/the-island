  "text": "Reading Assignments\nDay 1: Introduction\n\nWelcome! We aspire to the implausible: a nine-day introduction to the unusual dynamics of the\nworld’s digital space, sufficient for a strategic understanding of what makes it difficult (but far\nfrom impossible) to regulate or shape; who’s trying to do it nonetheless; and how such efforts\nhave fared over the past twenty years, with an eye towards lessons for influencing the space\nand the behavior within it today.\n\nIn addition to offering some frameworks for thinking about Internet architecture and policy, and\nthe curious open and generative nature of the phenomenon, we will delve into the net as a\ncontingently global phenomenon, and the way that complicates regulation by traditional\nsovereigns. Our case study will be the current debates around implementation of Europe’s “right\nto be forgotten” in search engine results. As you complete the readings, you might see how\nyou'd answer the question of what a state like France’s view should be towards the scope of its\nRTBF regulation, and whether the kind of “zoning” described in the Cato Institute article from\nthirteen years ago (!), is realizable and desirable.\n\nReadings:\n\ne C.P.
