  "text": "Underweight Travel & Leisure\n\n- Airlines in structural decline: our European Airlines analyst thinks overcapacity\n(networks set to grow 7% yoy to 2020) and competition from low cost/ ME carriers\nis driving prices and passenger yields lower across the board.\n\n- Negatively correlated to Oil: the sector is negatively correlated to the Oil price\nand despite recent weakness, our Commodity Strategist expects OPEC to cut by\n500k b/d or 1 million b/d. Should OPEC cut with firm quotas and a tight control\nmechanism, they see WTI prices averaging $59/bbl.\n\n+ Watch UK consumer confidence closely: the combined effect of the challenges\nwe identified earlier starting to mount for the UK consumer and the drop in the\nvalue of the pound could reduce demand for and expenditure on overseas holidays.\nThis would weigh on the travel operator part of the sector. If the bulk of sterling\nmove is over the boost for dollar earnings like Compass will also likely fade.\n\n¢ Peak returns: unlike Retail, T&L margins (98%ile since 2004) and RoEs (85%ile) are\nclose to all-time highs. We think returns may well have peaked therefore given the\nbackdrop of rising oil, weakening consumer confidence in the UK and structural\novercapacity in airlines. This is reflected in the fact that PBV are on 2.8x for the\nsector, which is top quintile for the sector since 2004.\n\nChart 70: Competition & overcapacity pushing airline yields down Chart 71: Rising oil would weigh on Travel earnings\na 140 6\n120 8\n100 10\n= 1\né 80 : 12\n; 60 14\n° 40 ee Brent Oil 6\n20 commen BofAML WTI forecasts 18\n0 ee Stoxx Travel & Leisure EPS (RHS - inverted}\n> Ke} ico} | eed foe) Lo?) fam) ~~ N oO — WwW oO NM\n> > > > > > > > > > > > > >\n2222 2222222222\nArran ———Luthersa ——=—AIAG cue —Ayanar Wine Ar\nSoureesConpannlia Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Datastream, IBES\nChart 72: The UK consumer will have lower purchasing power next year Chart 73: Yet sector RoEs remain close to all-time highs\n10 0.75 24.0%\n—— GfK UK Consumer Confidence\nIndex 0.7 22.0%\n0 SALAM ——Travel & Leisure RoE\n0.65 awe\n-10 06 18.0%\n16.0%\n-20 0.55\n14.0%\n0.5\n-30 12.0%\n0.45\n10.0%\n-40 0.4\noor KT NNO Oh Mehl tThClU TUL YH YH O 8.0%\nLF gots u at is gat = mS a te u mals iJ gots > ire} oO | eed foe) oO oO ~~ N oD — WwW ce\n©£ sa £& BSB £& B&B £& B&B £& 5B 2 Sd 8S a S&S F&F =\nSag TS\" ar aeseas RFS RRRRRRRRE\nSource: Bloomberg Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Datastream, IBES\n: Bankof America\n32 European Equity Strategy | 01 December 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014491",
