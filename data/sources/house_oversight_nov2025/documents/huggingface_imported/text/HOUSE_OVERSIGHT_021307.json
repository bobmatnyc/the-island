  "text": "mutually reinforcing leading to\nsynchrony.\n\nIn any dynamic social situation\nobserving one person’s action can\ninitiate neural activity in another. Parts\nof the observer’s motor system become\nactivated, making it possible to respond\nin synchrony. In fact, the specific actions\nthat are observed are not as important as\nthe perceived goals or intentions of the\nobserved person. One consequence of\nthis is that a person is sensitive to new\nactions in the social environment. A\nsecond is that significant actions by\nanother person can quickly produce\ncomplementary motor responses. Thus,\nadaptive social behavior is a product of\nperceptual monitoring and motor\nprocesses. The complexity of the social\nenvironment necessitates selective\nresponding to socially significant\nfeatures of any social interaction. Such\nselective responding depends on the\nobserver having particular goals for\naction. The identification of significant\nstimuli (e.g., a threatening backhand\nsmash) activates in the competitor’s\nbrain goal-driven decision processes that\noperate in parallel with continuous social\nmonitoring and lead to a counteraction\n(e.g., a defensive lob) produced by the\nmotor system. However, a linesman\ncollecting a ball during a tennis match\ndoes not constitute a significant action\nfor the competition and, even if\nobserved, does not initiate any\ncounteraction.\n\nLet us now return to the\nperspective of a spectator at the tennis\nmatch. While the specific movements\ndriving the tennis match have significant\nimplications for the players’ actions,\nthese movements have a different\nimplication for the spectator from whom\nno overt responses are warranted. If an\nobserved action produced by someone\n\nPage |6l\n\nelse does not have personal significance\nfor an observer, the motor system does\nnot respond in the same way at all’. The\ngoal-dependent aspect of observing the\nactions of others allows us to understand\nand respond quickly and effectively\nwithout confusing what we do with what\nwe see. However, in some special cases,\nwhen a group of individuals all respond\ntogether, the same motor system may\noperate differently. It is in these\nsituations when we are neither observer\nnor respondent but part of a flock or\nchorus that our sense of individuated self\nmay begin to dissolve into the larger\nsocial group.\n\nThe Social Parameters for Suspended\nSelf-Consciousness\n\nThe dissolution of self-other\nboundaries is likely to be manifest under\na specific set of conditions, which\nincludes a strong feeling of identification\nwith (i.e., connection between) oneself\nand a group of others, the absence of\nconstraints to action by oneself or the\nobserved others, a common goal shared\nby the group, and the absence of a\nrecognized external synchronizing signal\nto which one can attribute any\nsynchronized behavior. Clapping in\nunison following a rousing performance\nis amore common example. This\nremarkable phenomenon is evidenced\ndespite considerable individual\ndifferences in clapping tempos. The\ntransition to entrained clapping, whereby\neach clapper affects the surrounding\nother clappers both locally and globally,\nenhances the noise intensity at the\nmoment of the clapping even though it\nleads to a decrease in the overall average\nnoise intensity in the room.\nSynchronized behavior occurs\nrhythmically and one way of capturing\nits regularities is to model its cycles,\nperiods, frequencies, and amplitudes '”.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021307",
