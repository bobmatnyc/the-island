  "text": "the lead-up to Iraq's invasion in 1990.\nWhen faced with a build-up of Iraqi\nforces along its border, Kuwait decided\nnot to mobilize its military out of fear\nthat the move would provoke Saddam\nHussein. The incentives for Gulf states to\nmake similar strategic calculations in the\nfuture will be greater when Iran has an\ninventory of nuclear weapons to match its\ngrowing ballistic missile capabilities.\n\nThe Gulf states, moreover, will likely\nreason that the U.S. capability to threaten\nor use force against a nuclear Iran will be\nsignificantly diminished. Even without\nnuclear weapons, Gulf states have seen,\nin their view, a long history of American\nreluctance to threaten or use force against\nIran. For example, the United States took\nno direct military action against Iran after\nit aided and abetted Hezbollah bombings\nagainst Americans in Lebanon in the\n1980s, after Iran supported the bombing\nof Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in\n1996, or even after Iran supported the\ndeadly campaign of improvised explosive\ndevices (IEDs) against U.S. troops in\nIraq. Gulf states will no doubt judge that\nif the United States was unable and\nunwilling to attack Tehran under these\ncircumstances, then it is certainly not\ngoing to attack Iran in the future, when it\nwill be able to retaliate with nuclear\nweapons.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029808",
