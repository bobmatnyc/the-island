(And Epstein can apply to\nhave his record expunged after a year.)\n\nAt which point, Reiter, the police chief, at odds with the District Attorney’s\noffice, recruits the involvement of the FBI. This is of course the Bush-era FBI and\nEpstein presents quite the Clinton-connected scandal. Still, solicitation, even of a\nminor, is not a federal crime. The FBI hits on the novel interpretation that if\nInternet solicitation can be considered interstate commerce, so can telephone\nsolicitation, permitting them to begin a deep dive investigation into Epstein’s\nfriends, many of whom receive subpoenas and are threatened with prosecution.\n\nIt’s all quite in the eye of the beholder: On the one end, Epstein is paying for\nsex acts (Epstein paid $200 for a massage with or without happy ending), on the\nother, he is abusing teenage girls. It’s a catch-22: How can a girl not old enough to\nvote be a prostitute? And yet, many girls not old enough to vote are without a\ndoubt prostitutes.\n\nCompounding Epstein’s predicament, the world outside of his carefully\nconstructed and controlled environment is someplace that he seems not just\nill-equipped to handle but in which he seems to be blindly grouping about (i.e. he’s\ntotally tone deaf). I visited him once during this time and found him weighing the\nconflicting advice of some of the most vaunted and egomaniacal lawyers (along\nwith Dershowitz and Black, celebrity criminal attorney, Gerald Lefcourt, and\nClinton prosecutor, Ken Starr) of the day—anyone with new advice, Epstein\nseemed to hire—as well as a catchall of the leading crisis managers, who he\nseemed to retain at will, all wrangling for fees and primacy.\n\nCertainly, the upshot of his dealings with the Justice Department seem to\ninvolve a through-the-looking-glass logic. The government threatens to prosecute\nhim (with the possibility of a 10-year sentence) and various friends, associates, and\nlovers, or offers what seems to be unprecedented arrangement in which Epstein’s\nlawyers (not federal prosecutors, but Epstein’s lawyers, in some ultimate act of self\nincrimination) have to go to the Palm Beach authorities and convince them to up\nthe charges to an offense that will send him to jail and get him a sex offender\nstatus. Except that a solicitation charge won’t produce that result. Therefore he has\nto get them to agree to a procurement or pimping charge (even though he has paid\nmoney, not received it—the sine qua non of pimping). What’s more, in a unique, if\nnot unprecedented arrangement, he has to agree to pay the legal fees of any of the\ngirls who want to sue him—and, agree not to defend himself from their\nsuits—forcing him to settle with each of the girls for what are reportedly high\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022859",
