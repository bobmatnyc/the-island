  "text": "Looking out at the tapestry of age-limited situations reveals a rather eclectic pastiche. In many of\nthese cases, the cut-off age seems both arbitrary and inappropriate given the statistics. Consider the legal\ndriving age. Is it the case that 16 year olds are responsible drivers? 16 years olds have higher crash rates\nthan any other age group in the United States, are more likely to die in a car crash than the average of all\nother age groups, and car crashes are the leading cause of death among 16 year olds. North Dakotans\nbelieve that 14 year olds can drive a car. They may have fewer drivers on the road, but that doesn’t mean\nthat a 14 year old won’t hit them or drive off the road after irresponsibly drinking. Why not keep all\nyouths off the road until 21 when the statistics on fatal car crashes drop? Or why not follow the lead of\ncar rental agencies and wait for the 25\" birthday?\n\nThere are at least two common answers to the driving age problem, both utilitarian: in farming\ncommunities, and other environments where children work with their parents, it is essential to have\nchildren driving as soon as possible; and throughout the country, many parents look forward to the day\nwhen their children can drive, thereby alleviating the need for their private chauffeur service. There is no\nquestion that these are benefits. But if the cost is death to the child and others, the economics just don’t\nwork out. One option would be to lower the legal driving age for those communities or situations in\nwhich parents demonstrate the significance of young children driving for their financial security and well\nbeing. Those without this justification must wait until they are 21, frontal lobes matured and the novelty\nof intoxication lowered.\n\nThe most interesting and relevant age-related issue is when someone is treated as an adult as\nopposed to a juvenile criminal. Within the United States, most states set the bar at 18 years, but some as\nyoung as 16. Where a state sets its bar determines whether or not the individual is eligible for the death\npenalty or a life sentence, as well as a host of social services. Many states with the bar currently set\nbelow 18, including my own state of Massachusetts, are presently debating whether the age limit should\nbe raised. For some, the issue is simply one of parity: this is not an issue where states should differ, and\nthus everyone should be with the majority at 18 years. Others add to this discussion by arguing that it\nshould be 18 because of brain maturation. Although it is absolutely the case that a more mature brain\nbrings with it better self-control and less sensation-seeking or risk-taking, there is no evidence of a\nreliable difference between 16, 17 and 18 year olds. Some 16 year olds are remarkably patient and risk-\naverse whereas some 18 years olds are remarkably impulsive and risk-prone. If this is to be a meaningful\ndiscussion about future risks, plasticity, and the opportunity for rehabilitation, it will have to grapple with\nthe scientific evidence that is presently on offer.\n\nWhen we use age to distinguish between legally permissible and forbidden actions, we have\nacknowledged that our biology and upbringing represent mitigating factors. We believe that juvenile\ncrimes are forgivable and their actions correctable. In fact, their crimes are forgivable because their\nactions are correctable. Once we admit nature and nurture into the legal calculus concerning our youths,\nwe must also allow such factors to guide our decisions about adults with developmental disorders, brain\ndamage, and different genetic make-up. Yet, the law seems to have a double standard: youths lack free\nwill, whereas adults have it, even if it is somewhat diminished. But if we believe that juveniles lack a\nsufficiently mature capacity for self-control, planning and thinking about alternative options, then we\nmust recognize that fully mature adults can lose these capacities as they naturally age, and can lose them\nat any age if they suffer from brain damage. We must also wrestle with the fact that some people are born\nwith a genetic constitution that makes them more vulnerable to addictions, sensation-seeking, violence,\nand a lack of compassion. Perhaps they too should be banned from driving, voting, drinking, marrying\nand military combat. When do we look at the excessive harms caused by individuals or groups and hold\nthem responsible? When do we punish them to pay for their crimes and fend off future atrocities?\n\nThe law often invokes the notion of future dangerousness as a means of evaluating risk. So too\ndoes the public and media. The general presumption is that for certain kinds of offences, there is a\npredictably high level of recidivism, of doing the same thing over and over again. But the implication of\nthis judgment is that those who are deemed guilty are, in some way, not responsible for their future. Their\nfuture is determined for them. In fact, it is so determined that the law is willing to make a confident\nwager and send these criminals to prison or to their death. On this view, someone who has already\n\nHauser Epilogue.
