  "text": "I will tell you more. Emirates Airlines’ successful model has not led only to achieving an internationally\nrecognition but also has induced the launch of other Arab airlines that followed the same model. Emirates has\nencouraged many established Arab airlines to enhance their fleets and upgrade their services. This has\nultimately led to increasing Arab airlines’ share of the in ternational travel market. Leading by example,\nEmirates has set new benchmarks for quality services not only regionally but also internationally. One can only\ngain world recognition by proving success and ability to take the initiative, yet this recognition may not\nnecessarily reflect acceptance.\n\nBy Thabet Amin Awad of Al Ahram Egyptian newspaper\n\nThere is no doubt that good planning is one of the key factors behind the success of the\nUAE, backed by the close monitoring of the ongoing challenges and opportunities. In\nyour plans, what are the challenges that you foresee? What is the country’s level of\nreadiness to address them?\n\nHumans face challenges throughout their lives. Through commitment to proper planning of projects and\nprogrammes, and following up on their implementation, challenges can be successfully addressed. It is also\ncrucial to anticipate challenges without ignoring any possibility. Yet, there are some unforeseen challenges that\noriginate remotely but influence us -- as in the global financial crisis that erupted in the United States and\nspread to the economies of developed countries and the rest of the world. One must be prepared to effectively\ndeal with the implications of such challenges to one’s country, economy and security. We, in the UAE, are\naware of the challenges that we face and are always prepared for the worst, and are also willing to face\nwhatever unforeseen developments regardless of their magnitude and im pact.\n\nBy Thabet Amin Awad of Al Ahram Egyptian newspaper\n\nYou have always stressed that the main challenge facing the Arab world, is that of the\ndevelopment of human resources in the knowledge era. Do you believe that the current\neducation systems are equipped to prepare a new generation that is able to face this\nchallenge and How?\n\nI am not in a position to assess the efficiency of the Arab educational institutions. But a common concern across\nthe Arab world is the poor education systems at both school and university levels. The international rankings of\nthe Arab universities are unsatisfactory to both the keen learners as well as the academic institutions.\n\nYes, the main challenge facing the Arab world is the challenge of human development in the era of knowledge.\nWithout the development of strong education systems, we will not easily achieve the desired development.\nDespite the importance of the state’s role in the development of education, the development effort is the\nresponsibility of society as a whole; the State must lead these efforts and involve the broadest segments of\nsociety. Isn’t strange that we approach the second decade of the third millennium with the average percentage\nof illiteracy in the Arab world more than 30 percent?\n\nBy Thabet Amin Awad of Al Ahram Egyptian newspaper\n\nAmid the growing global crisis and in the latest G20=2 O0summit, many were demanding a\nre-consideration of the global economic system, and declaring the failure the entire\nsystem of capitalism. Would the United Arab Emirates -- with its regional and\ninternational reach -- consider a new financial direction, such as the Islamic banking\nsystem as a substitute, even temporarily, to the current global economic system — which is\ncurrently deteriorating?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024944",
