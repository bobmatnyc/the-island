Congress intended that the CVRA's new rights not be \"simply words on paper,\" but rather \"meaningful and functional\"\nreforms. !° To that end, Congress mandated that courts shall \"ensure\" that crime victims are \"afforded the rights\" conveyed\nby the CVRA. |°! To effectively ensure that victims’ rights are protected, these rights must become part of the warp and woof\nof the criminal process. That can occur only if the federal rules - the day-to-day operations manual of the courts - spell out how\nto integrate victims into the process.\n\nJudges and practitioners frequently refer to the Federal Rules of Criminal Procedure for guidance as to how to conduct\nhearings. If victims' rights are left out of the federal rules, the strong possibility exists that courts may mistakenly disregard\nvictims’ rights under the CVRA. A good illustration comes from Rule 11, which spells out in some detail how judges should\nconduct a hearing accepting a plea. The judge is required to personally inform the defendant of certain specified rights and\nensure that the defendant understands he will be waiving those rights. !°* The judge must also determine that the defendant is\nvoluntarily entering the plea and that there is a factual basis for the guilty plea. '°? Under the CVRA, victims now also have the\n\nright to be heard before the judge accepts any plea. !°4 This is a new right, 1°\n\nwhich judges are not accustomed to\nadministering. Unless the victim's right to be heard is specifically spelled out in Rule 11's plea procedures, some judges may\n\ninadvertently disregard it.\n\n[*854] The Oklahoma City bombing case further demonstrates how courts sometimes blindly follow the federal rules without\nconsidering superseding statutes. In that case, the court excluded victim-witnesses from certain proceedings, relying solely on\nFederal Rule of Evidence 615 in making tts determination. In denying the witnesses entrance to the proceedings, the court was\napparently unaware of the provision in the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act protecting a victim's right to attend. !°° This\n\ndeficiency was called to the attention of the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Evidence. !°7 The committee\nacknowledged the need to include victims in the evidence rules and later added a new provision reflecting the victim's right to\nattend, 1%\n\nOne reason for including victims' rights in the rules is to avoid litigation about the negative inferences that might be drawn if\nvictims’ rights are not in the rules. It is a well-settled principle of statutory construction that expressio unius est exclusio alterius\n(the expression of one thing implies the exclusion of the other). This canon of construction applies to the federal rules as much\nas to statutes. !°? Because the rules repeatedly spell out situations in which the defendant has the right to have his interests\nconsidered but say nothing about victims, it might be argued that the rules have implicitly determined that a victim's interests\nare irrelevant. To return to the Rule 11 plea example, given that the criminal rules specify that a court must address the\ndefendant but lack any comparable requirement for victims, it might be inferred that victims cannot speak at plea hearings.
