You can hear the whole recording at the bottom of the post.\n\nHere is what he said, unedited:\n\nSteve Bannon: Thank you very much Benjamin, and I appreciate you guys including us\nin this. We’re speaking from Los Angeles today, right across the street from our\nheadquarters in Los Angeles. Um. I want to talk about wealth creation and what wealth\ncreation really can achieve and maybe take it in a slightly different direction, because I\nbelieve the world, and particularly the Judeo-Christian west, is in a crisis. And it’s really\nthe organizing principle of how we built Breitbart News to really be a platform to bring\nnews and information to people throughout the world. Principally in the west, but we’re\nexpanding internationally to let people understand the depths of this crisis, and it is a\ncrisis both of capitalism but really of the underpinnings of the Judeo-Christian west in\nour beliefs.\n\nIt’s ironic, I think, that we’re talking today at exactly, tomorrow, 100 years ago, at the\nexact moment we're talking, the assassination took place in Sarajevo of Archduke Franz\nFerdinand that led to the end of the Victorian era and the beginning of the bloodiest\ncentury in mankind’s history.

Seven weeks later, I think there were 5 million men in\nuniform and within 30 days there were over a million casualties.\n\nThat war triggered a century of barbaric — unparalleled in mankind’s history — virtually\n180 to 200 million people were killed in the 20th century, and I believe that, you know,\nhundreds of years from now when they look back, we’re children of that: We’re children\nof that barbarity. This will be looked at almost as a new Dark Age.\n\nBut the thing that got us out of it, the organizing principle that met this, was not just the\nheroism of our people — whether it was French resistance fighters, whether it was the\nPolish resistance fighters, or it’s the young men from Kansas City or the Midwest who\nstormed the beaches of Normandy, commandos in England that fought with the Royal Air\nForce, that fought this great war, really the Judeo-Christian West versus atheists, right?\n\nThe underlying principle is an enlightened form of capitalism, that capitalism really gave\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029043",
