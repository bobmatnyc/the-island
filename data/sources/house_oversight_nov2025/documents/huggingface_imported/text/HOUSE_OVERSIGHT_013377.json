  "text": "b. Epstein’s Allegations of Negligence by Edwards are Unfounded and Not\nActionable in Any Event.\n\nIn his Second Amended Complaint Epstein recognizes at least the possibility that\nEdwards was not involved in any Rothstein Ponzi scheme. Therefore, seemingly as a fallback,\nEpstein alleges without explanation that Edwards “should have known” about the existence of\nthis concealed Ponzi scheme. Among other problems, this fallback negligence position suffers\nthe fatal flaw that it does not link at all to the intentional tort of abuse of process alleged in the\ncomplaint.\n\nEpstein’s negligence claim is also deficient because it simply fails to satisfy the\nrequirements for a negligence cause of action:\n\n“Four elements are necessary to sustain a negligence claim: 1. A duty, or\n\nobligation, recognized by the law, requiring the [defendant] to conform to a\n\ncertain standard of conduct, for the protection of others against unreasonable\n\nrisks, 2. A failure on the [defendant’s] part to conform to the standard required: a\n\nbreach of the duty ....3. A reasonably close causal connection between he\n\nconduct and the resulting injury. This is what is commonly known as ‘legal\n\ncause,’ or ‘proximate cause,’ and which includes the notion of cause in fact. 4.\n\nActual loss or damage.\n\nCurd v. Mosaic Fertilizer, LLC, —-— So.2d__, 2010 WL 2400384 at *9 (Fla. 2010). Epstein\ndoes not allege a particular duty on the part of Edwards that has been breached. Nor does\nEpstein explain how any breach of the duty might have proximately caused him actual damages.\nSummary judgment is therefore appropriate for these reasons as well.\n\nFinally, for the sake of completeness, it is worth noting briefly that no reasonable jury\n\ncould find Edwards to have been negligent in failing to anticipate that a managing partner at his\n\nlaw firm would be involved in an unprecedented Ponzi scheme.
