Focuses of this initiative include poverty, climate \nchange, global health, and religious and ethnic conflicts.\" \nI just wanted to clarify if Mr. Epstein was on the board of directors or listed as a founder anywhere or on any \npaperwork associated with the foundation and if so, in what capacity. Also wanted to clarify what you \nspecifically mean by being part of the original group. \nI attached a screen shot of the exact passage I am referring to. \nThanks, \nMalia \nMalia Zimmerman \nInvestigative Reporter, \nFoxNews.com  \n2044 Armacost Avenue \nLos Angeles, CA 90025 \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029501 \nE: \nThis message and its attachments may contain legally privileged or confidential information.
