Isn’t it normal practice for federal prosecutors\nonly to extend immunity to specifically named persons, not an open-ended group of “any” co-conspirator.\n\n9. How did you travel to Epstein’s mansion in West Palm Beach?\n\n10. How many times have you been to Epstein’s private ranch, called “Zorro”, in New Mexico?\n\n11. How many times have you been to Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands, known as Little St. John’s.\n\n12. Did you ever see young girls present at Little St. John’s?\n\n13.
