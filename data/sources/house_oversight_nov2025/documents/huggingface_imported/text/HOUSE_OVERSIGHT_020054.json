  "text": "place—even the new secretary of state designate, Rex Tillerson, had no real experience in\nforeign policy. To bewildered foreign secretaries, it seemed logical to see the\npresidentelect’s son-in-law as a figure of stability. Whatever happened, he would be there.\nAnd for certain regimes, especially the familycentric Saudis, Kushner, the son-in-law, was\nmuch more reassuring than a policy person. He wasn’t in his job because of his ideas.\n\nOf the many Trump gashes in modern major-power governing, you could certainly\ndrive a Trojan horse through his lack of foreign policy particulars and relationships. This\npresented a do-over opportunity for the world in its relationship with the United States—\nor it did if you were willing to speak the new Trump language, whatever that was. There\nwasn’t much of a road map here, just pure opportunism, a new transactional openness. Or,\neven more, a chance to use the powers of charm and seduction to which Trump responded\nas enthusiastically as he did to offers of advantageous new deals.\n\nIt was Kissingeresque realpolitik. Kissinger himself, long familiar with Trump by way\nof the New York social world and now taking Kushner under his wing, was successfully\nreinserting himself, helping to organize meetings with the Chinese and the Russians.\n\nMost of America’s usual partners, and even many antagonists, were unsettled if not\nhorrified. Still, some saw opportunity. The Russians could see a free pass on the Ukraine\nand Georgia, as well as a lifting of sanctions, in return for giving up on Iran and Syria.\nEarly in the transition, a high-ranking official in the Turkish government reached out in\ngenuine confusion to a prominent U.S. business figure to inquire whether Turkey would\nhave better leverage by putting pressure on the U.S. military presence in Turkey or by\noffering the new president an enviable hotel site on the Bosporus.\n\nThere was something curiously aligned between the Trump family and MBS. Like the\nentire Saudi leadership, MBS had, practically speaking, no education outside of Saudi\nArabia. In the past, this had worked to limit the Saudi options—nobody was equipped to\nconfidently explore new intellectual possibilities. As a consequence, everybody was wary\nof trying to get them to imagine change. But MBS and Trump were on pretty much equal\nfooting. Knowing little made them oddly comfortable with each other. When MBS offered\nhimself to Kushner as his guy in the Saudi kingdom, that was “like meeting someone nice\nat your first day of boarding school,” said Kushner’s friend.\n\nCasting aside, in very quick order, previously held assumptions—in fact, not really\naware of those assumptions—the new Trump thinking about the Middle East became the\nfollowing: There are basically four players (or at least we can forget everybody else)—\nIsrael, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Iran. The first three can be united against the fourth. And\nEgypt and Saudi Arabia, given what they want with respect to Iran—and anything else\nthat does not interfere with the United States’ interests—will pressure the Palestinians to\nmake a deal. Voila.\n\nThis represented a queasy-making mishmash of thought. Bannon’s isolationism (a pox\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020054",
