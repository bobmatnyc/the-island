  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nWe categorically disapprove the theory...that obscene, pornographic films acquire\nconstitutional immunity from state regulation simply because they are exhibited for\nconsenting adults only... The States have a long-recognized legitimate interest in the\nquality of life and the total community environment, the tone of commerce in the great city\ncenters, and, possibly, the public safety itself.\n\nBut as I promised Judge Aldrich, I continued to press my principle in the court of public opinion\nand in a series of other obscenity cases over the next several decades. Ultimately my view would\nprevail, if not in law then certainly in practice, as we shall see. Chief Justice Burger may have\nwon in the courthouse, but we won in theaters and on television sets throughout the nation, as\nsexually explicit films—far more explicit than J Am Curious Yellow—became pervasive and\n“legal” in fact if not in law. This disparity between the law, as set down in theory by the Supreme\nCourt, and the law, as implemented in practice throughout the country, is an interesting story in\nitself.\n\n105\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017192",
