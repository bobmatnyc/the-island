  "text": "152\n\nIf Snowden could cause such massive damage, so could other civilian trainees at the NSA.\nSomeone in the chain of command had to take responsibility, General Alexander tendered his\nresignation on June 30\", 2013. “ I’m the director, “he said, falling on his sword. “Ultimately, I’m\naccountable. “ As President Obama did not want the head of the NSA resigning in the midst of the\nSnowden crisis, he asked him to stay on for another six months. He then appointed Admiral\nMichael Rogers to be his replacement. Meanwhile, it had become undeniable clear to the Review\nCommittee appointed by President Obama in 2013 that the NSA’s own defenses had\ncatastrophically failed. If so, this change was the equivalent of re-arranging the deck chairs on the\nS.S. Titanic after it hit an iceberg.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020304",
