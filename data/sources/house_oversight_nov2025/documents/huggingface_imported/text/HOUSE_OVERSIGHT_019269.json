  "text": "Freedom House\n\nChapter 5\n\nThe Rise of ‘Illiberal Democracy’\n\nIn July 2014, Hungarian prime minister Viktor Orban\ngave what has come to be known as his “illiberal\ndemocracy\" speech before an ethnic Hungarian audi-\nence in Baile Tusnad, Romania.! Several points in his\nremarks are worth noting:\n\n¢ Orban urged his listeners to no longer regard the\n1989 triumph over communism as the reference\npoint for developments in Hungary. Instead of\nmeasuring progress from the transition from\ndictatorship and foreign domination to elections,\ncivil liberties, and sovereignty, Orban said Hungary\nshould adopt a new point of departure, the onset\nof the global financial crisis in 2008, which also\nmarked the European Union’s greatest setback.\n\n¢ He cited U.S. president Barack Obama and vari-\nous unnamed sources on the West's weakness,\nincluding an “internationally recognized analyst\"\nwho wrote that liberal values today “embody\ncorruption, sex, and violence.”\n\n« He suggested that in the future it would be\nsystems that were “not Western, not liberal,\nnot liberal democracies, and perhaps not even\ndemocracies’ that would create successful and\ncompetitive societies. He asserted that “the\nstars of the international analysts today are\nSingapore, China, India, Russia, and Turkey.”\n\nIn a passage devoted to the obstacles facing his\nown political party, Fidesz, as it seeks to build an\nalternative to liberalism, Orban singled out civil\nsociety and the nongovernmental sector. Civil\nsociety critics, he insisted, “are not nongovern-\nmental organizations\" but “paid political activists\nwho are attempting to enforce foreign interests\nhere in Hungary.” (In a separate speech in early\n2016, he referred to “hordes of implacable hu-\nman rights warriors\" who “feel an unquenchable\ndesire to lecture and accuse us.’”)\n\nIn this relatively short address, Orban neatly summa-\nrized most of the key factors that distinguish a fully\ndemocratic “Western” system based on liberal values\nand accountability from what he calls an “Eastern”\napproach based ona strong state, a weak opposition,\nand emaciated checks and balances.\n\n“There is a race underway to find the\nmethod of community organization,\nthe state, which is most capable of\nmaking a nation and a community\ninternationally competitive... [T]he\nmost popular topic in thinking today\nis trying to understand how systems\nthat are not Western, not liberal, not\nliberal democracies, and perhaps not\neven democracies, can nevertheless\nmake their nations successful.”\n\n—Viktor Orban, prime minister of Hungary\n\n“If we want to organize our national\nstate to replace the liberal state, it is\nvery important that we make it clear\nthat we are not opposing nongov-\nernmental organizations here, and\n\nit is not nongovernmental organi-\nzations who are moving against us,\nbut paid political activists who are\nattempting to enforce foreign inter-\nests here in Hungary.”\n\n—Viktor Orban\n\nFirst, his exhortation to no longer regard the events of\n1989 as a seminal, even sacred, juncture in Hungarian\nhistory is noteworthy given Orban's biography. While\nhe often cites his own role in the anticommunist\nstruggle and describes himself as a freedom fighter,\nhe now regards 1989—so redolent of liberal values,\nideas about individual freedom, and democratic\nsolidarity—as an intellectual impediment to his plans\nfor a Hungary that is skeptical of such ideals and of\nEuropean integration.\n\nSecond, Orban included full-blown dictatorships\n(Russia and China) in the roster of governments he\nadmires, along with quasi-democratic illiberal states\n(Turkey and Singapore) and one genuine, if inconsis-\ntent, democracy (India).\n\nwww.freedomhouse.org\n\n35\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019269",
