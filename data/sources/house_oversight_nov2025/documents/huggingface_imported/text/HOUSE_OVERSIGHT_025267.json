  "text": "Asian equities (ex-Japan)\n\nMSCI Asia ex-Japan (24 Oct): 518 (last publication: 510)\nUBS view MSCI Asia ex-Japan (6-month target): 545\n\n¢ China released a set of positive data for September. While the headline 3Q GDP number only met\nexpectations at +7.4% YoY (consensus +7.4%, prior +7.6%), the higher frequency data was better.\nIndustrial production of +9.2% YoY (consensus +9.0%, prior +8.9%), retail sales of +14.2% YoY\n(consensus +13.2%, prior +13.2%), and fixed asset investment of +20.5% (+20.2% consensus, prior\n+20.2%) all came in higher.\n\nChinese H-Shares are up almost 10% in the last month, while the S&P 500 is within 0.4 index points of\nwhere it was a month ago. Valuations of MSCI China remain extremely attractive as the market\ncontinues to price in a hard landing scenario, although sentiment is clearly turning. In India, the\ngovernment has proposed several key economic reforms, but there are implementation risks and\nconsensus GDP forecasts still have downside risk, while Indonesia's economic momentum is on track.\n\nWe expect 12.8% earnings-per-share growth over 12 months for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan. It trades on\n11.0x 12-m forward earnings and 1.6x price-to-book. We expect a stable earnings multiple in the next six\nmonths. Economic growth should stabilize and earnings downgrades come to an end toward the end of\n2012.\n\nA Positive scenario MSCI Asia ex-Japan (6-month target): 670\n\ne More supportive monetary and fiscal policy, stable inflation, sustained domestic demand growth, and an\nimproved global growth outlook lead to a better earnings outlook. In such a scenario, we expect\nearnings growth of 15% and a trailing P/E of about 15.0x.\n\n& Negative scenario MSCI Asia ex-Japan (6-month target): 400\n\ne A hard landing in China with a global recession leads to negative earnings revisions for 2012. In this\nscenario, Asia ex-Japan could trade down to about 10.5x realized earnings.\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\n\nPolitics Leadership in China is set to change, resulting in a newly defined future\neconomic policy. The US Presidential elections have implications on the\noutcome of the Fiscal Cliff. Key dates: Nov 6, 57\" US Presidential\nElections; Nov 8, 18°\" Communist Party Congress\n\nPolicy responses Some other countries in the region have near-term macroeconomic issues due\nto fiscal and current account deficits, as well as hiccups in market and economic\nreforms. Policy responses often come on an ad-hoc basis.\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\n° The Fed's implementation of QE3 provides\n\nsupport to Asia ex-Japan equities. In\n\nconjunction with improving growth\n\nprospects we see good near term upside.\n\nShould economic growth surprise to the\n\nupside, more defensive markets such as\n\nSingapore and Malaysia are likely to\n\nunderperform. Instead, higher beta,\n\nexport-oriented markets like South Korea,\n\nTaiwan, Hong Kong and China are likely to\n\ntake advantage from a strengthening in\n\nglobal growth.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\n¢ Consider a portfolio mix of high yield\nstocks largely found in Singapore, Taiwan\n& HK, complemented by growth-oriented\nstocks in the rest of Asia.\n\nCountry preferences within Asia ex\nJapan (relative to MSCI Asia ex Japan)\n\nunderweight neutral overweight\nChina —————]\nHong Kong\nIndia\nIndonesia |\nKorea a\nMalaysia |\nPhilippines 7\nSingapore\nTaiwan\nThailand\nOthers\nBnew old\n\nFor further information please contact ClO asset class specialist Kelvin Tay, kelvin.tay@ubs.com 20\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025267",
