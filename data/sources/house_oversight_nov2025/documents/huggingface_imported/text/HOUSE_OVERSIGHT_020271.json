The conspirators escaped and kept their identities secret for over 42\nyears.\n\nSelf-definitions also do necessarily produce a distinction between whistle-blowers and\nconventional spies. Consider, for example Philip Agee. Agee left the CIA in 1969 for what he\ndescribed “reasons of conscience.” Specifically, he said he objected to the CIA’s covert support\nof Latin America dictators. After contacting the Soviet Embassy in Mexico City, he defected to\nCuba, where he leaked information that exposed CIA operations. Although Agee insisted he was\na whistle-blower, and he adamantly denied offering any secrets to the Soviet Union, the KGB\nviewed him as a conventional spy. According to Oleg Kalugin, the top Soviet counterintelligence\nofficer in the KGB in Moscow, who defected to the U.S., Agee offered CIA secrets first to the\nKGB residency in Mexico City in 1973 and then to Cuban intelligence service. Agee provided the\nKGB with a “treasure trove” of US secrets, Kalugin revealed. “I then sat in my office in Moscow\nreading the growing list of revelations coming from Agee.” Despite this disparity, Agee still\ndefined himself to the public as a whistle-blower because he also had exposed CIA operations to\nthe public.\n\nThe Snowden case blurs the demarcation line even further. Unlike other whistle-blowers who\nuncovered what they considered government malfeasance by virtue of their job, Snowden, by his\nown admission, took a new job in 2013 specifically to get access to the SCI files concerning NSA\nsources that he stole from the Threat Operations Center. Switching jobs in order to widen one’s\naccess to state secrets us an activity usually associated with penetration agents, not whistle-\nblowers. While the technical distinction between a whistle-blower and a spy may still serve the\nmedia in the case of Snowden, it does not help in solving the counterintelligence conundrum.\n\nUntangling the strands of the Snowden conundrum is no easy matter. A complex burglary\nof state secrets had been successfully carried in a supposedly-secure site. The only known\nwitness, Snowden, had escaped to Russia, where he could be of help in reconstructing the crime.\nThe stolen data was kept in the equivalent of sealed “vaults”\ndrives that were not connected to the NSA Network ever there was a locked room mystery, this\nwas it.\n\nwhich were actually computer\n\nThe perpetrator Snowden pierced these barriers by using passwords that belonged to other\npeople and using credentials that allowed him to masquerade as a system administrator. However\nit was carried out, it was feat required meticulous planning. As in the earlier example ofa\nhypothetical diamond theft from locked vaults, what is needed is to explain how a perpetrator,\nwho did not himself have the combinations to open them or the means to remove their content,\nsucceeded in the theft.\n\nTo address such a mystery, a counterintelligence investigation starts with a tabula rasa,\nstripping away all the previous assumptions, including that Snowden was the lone perpetrator.\nOnce back at square one, it builds alternative scenarios to test against the known facts.
