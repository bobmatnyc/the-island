  "text": "From: Jeffrey Epstein [jeeyacation@gmail.com] \nSent: 2/14/2013 8:45:53 PM \nTo: Larry Summers \nTunisia: Tunisia's transition suffered a terrible blow on February 6th when leftist opposition alliance founder and \nhead of the Democratic Patriots party Chokri Belaid was shot dead outside his home in Tunis. The event drew \nthousands of protestors to the streets, clamoring against the leading Islamist Ennanda party. The events heighten \nthe Islamist-secular divide that has featured in the Tunisian transition and the Arab Spring at large. Tunisian Prime \nMinister Hamadi Jebali described the event as the \"assassination of the Tunisian revolution\" and promised to \ndissolve the Islamist-led government and form a technocrat government aimed at promoting national unity at this \ndivisive time. \nEgypt: The second anniversary of the Egyptian revolution on January 25th was marked less by celebration than it \nwas by violence, culminating in a week of unrest that took the lives of more than 50 people. The week was also \nmarked by the imposition of a curfew, state of emergency, and large military deployment in the cities of Suez, \nIsmailliya, and Port Said. The events reflect the disillusionment of Egyptians, given the lack of progress on both \npolitical and economic fronts, while also revealing the state's limitations in restoring order and the rule of law to \nthe streets. That the army—the country's most powerful institution—warned of the \"collapse of the state\" is a \ntelling and serious message, conveying the institution's growing frustration with the political impasse. \nThe recent violence has also generated serious economic losses and fuel shortages, and caused yet another delay \nwith the much-needed IMF loan. It will be interesting to see how the recent violence—as well as the general \nmalaise caused by economic woes—affects the Muslim Brotherhood's performance in the upcoming \nparliamentary election (which is yet to be scheduled). A recent report issued by the Brotherhood's political bureau \nhinted that the party's popularity has been in decline. \nAgainst this backdrop of political and economic turmoil, the 12th summit of the Organization of Islamic \nCooperation (OIC) convened in Cairo on February 5th with a number of key players in the region in attendance—\namong them President Gill of Turkey, Emir Hamad al-Thani of Qatar, and Saudi Crown Prince Salman. The \nsummit aimed to discuss Syria, Mali, and the Palestinian issue. The spotlight, however, was on Mahmoud \nAhmadinejad: the first Iranian president to visit Egypt since the 1979 Islamic revolution. \nLibya: On January 31', European Union foreign policy chief Catherine Ashton announced the launch of a two-\nyear civil mission to help secure Libya's 4,000-kilometer border. The announcement was complemented by a \nsurprise visit to Tripoli by David Cameron, who also announced his government's commitment to helping the \nLibyan military and police with training and support. Furthermore, a meeting in Paris the week of February 11th \nwill bring together a number of countries to discuss security cooperation and the future of the Libyan legal system. \nThese initiatives are a telling manifestation of the urgent need to address security in Libya—especially border \nsecurity—given the Mali crisis, the recent terrorist incident in Algeria, and concerns about security and stability \nacross North Africa. \nJordan: The results of the Jordanian parliamentary election came as no surprise: pro-government candidates \nstrengthened their hold, though state television reported that the majority of the 150 seats had been won by \nindependents (an indicator that tribal allegiance is becoming a more important factor than party politics). \nAccording to official figures, 56 percent of the country's 2.3 million registered voters turned out for the ballot, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029689 \nwith the most obvious absence being that of the Muslim Brotherhood, which protested what it considered to be a \nbiased ballot. It remains unclear who will succeed Prime Minister Abdullah Ensur (who submitted his resignation \nto King Abdullah on January 29th), although analysts and commentators consider it likely that a number of \nunexpected appointments will be made in an effort to address the growing malaise. Media reports speculate that \nthere are also plans to set up an official channel for communication with the Muslim Brotherhood. Meanwhile, it \nappears that King Abdullah is seeking to bolster ties with regional allies, perhaps for both political and economic \nreasons: the King made visits to Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait from January 29th to February \n4th. \nSyria: Israeli warplanes are generally believed to have struck a convoy en route to Lebanon on January 30th, \nalthough this has not been confirmed by the government of Israel. The convoy was reported to have been carrying \nsophisticated antiaircraft weaponry to Hezbollah. The attack—carried out on the outskirts of Damascus—was met \nby a sharp threat of retaliation from both the Syrian and Iranian governments: a significant indicator of the regional \nreverberations of the Syrian civil war and the general volatility permeating the region. \nDespite the lack of progress of an international peace initiative spearheaded by Special Envoy Lakhdar Brahimi, \na new plan by Syrian opposition leader Moaz al-Khatib—comprising a dialogue with President al-Assad based \non the principle of the regime's departure—offers a glimmer of hope. Upon meeting with al-Khatib on February \n3rd, the foreign ministers of Iran and Russia (the closest allies of the al-Assad regime) seem to have agreed to help \nfacilitate this process—an interesting turn of events. The new plan comes as the humanitarian situation continues \nto deteriorate, although some help is foreseen from the $1.5 billion in pledges made at a donors' conference on \nJanuary 30th in Kuwait. \nIsrael: While recent elections kept Netanyahu's Likud party in the lead by winning 31 of 120 seats in the Knesset, \nthe new centrist party Yesh Atid's ability to win 19 seats under the leadership of Yair Lapid garnered all the \nattention. The results generated media debate about the possibility of a shift in Israeli policy vis-à-vis the \nPalestinians. In fact, the election campaign and its results were centered on domestic and socioeconomic issues, \nand internal reform. Furthermore, Yesh Atid is known to maintain an ambiguous stance on the peace process. \nOn January 29th, Israel became the first country to boycott a United Nations review of its human rights practices, \ndespite the United States' and other political players' advice to participate. This is a breach of an established \npractice of cooperation and thus represents precedence for noncooperation by other states. It also leaves the \nquestion of human rights in occupied Palestinian territories outside the jurisdiction of the international \ncommunity. It remains unclear, however, whether the newly elected government will make a pragmatic effort to \nreengage with the UN review effort. \nBahrain: On January 21st King Hamad al-Khalifa issued a decree endorsing a renewed national dialogue. \nSubsequently, on February 4th, Minister of Justice Khalid bin Ali al-Khalifa announced that the national dialogue \nwould resume on February 10th. Press reports indicate willingness by the opposition's to participate in the \ndialogue. \n5 th \nIran: President Ahmadinejad was warmly welcomed by President Morsi upon arrival in Cairo on February \nand, interestingly, by the Sunni leadership of Al-Azhar. The Iranian leader reciprocated by offering to provide \nEgypt with a \"big credit line\" to help its lagging economy, a telling indication of Tehran's desire for a \nrapprochement. The reaction on the Egyptian street, however, was generally negative, revealing thedisconnect \nbetween a dominant Muslim Brotherhood political elite reaching out to an Islamist power and a critical faction of \nEgyptian society hostile to this shift. The meeting is not necessarily an indicator that bilateral ties will improve, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 029690 \ngiven Egypt's much-savored relationship with other Gulf countries (not to mention the United States). It does \nrepresent a re-balancing of relationships in a changing Middle East nonetheless. \nA new round of talks between Iran and the P5+1 (five permanent members of the Security Council plus Germany) \nhas now been scheduled to take place on February 26th following weeks of conflicting reports and what seemed \nto be a diplomatic stalemate. This represents the first effort at talks at the political directors' level since the \nMoscow meeting in June of 2012. While the talks are restarting just over a month after the start of US President \nObama's second term, Iran appears to have moved into its political season: tensions between President \nAhmadinejad and the speaker of the Majlis, Larjani, have gone public with mutual recriminations about corrupt \nfamily members and associates. \nSaudi Arabia: Former intelligence chief Prince Muqrin bin Abdulaziz was appointed second deputy prime minister of Saudi \nArabia on February rd, a role traditionally associated with the incumbent being second in line to become king. Prince \nMuqrin is the youngest son of the kingdom's founder. \nYemen: A UN Security Council delegation visited Yemen on January 27th in a show of support to President Hadi \nand Yemen's political transition. The visit reflects the Security Council's interest in seeing Yemen move forward \nwith the National Dialogue Conference. During the visit there were large demonstrations, as thousands demanded \na fair and just approach in dealing with former president Ali Abdullah Saleh, who has received immunity under \nthe Gulf Cooperation Council initiative. \n--\n*********************************************************** \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for \nthe use of the addressee.
