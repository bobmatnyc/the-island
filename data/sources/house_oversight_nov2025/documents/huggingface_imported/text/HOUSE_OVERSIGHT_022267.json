  "text": "Describe WE Talks, and why you believe it's different from other \"empowerment\nseries.\"\n\nWE Talks (“WE” standing for women empowerment) is an event series for female\nentrepreneurs and professionals organized on a monthly basis. The idea of WE\nTalks was to create an intimate environment where our attendees can build\nrelationships in an organic way, based on mutual interests and shared values. We\nencourage our guests to learn not only from our speakers, but also from each\nother, to connect exchange contacts, and stay in touch. WE Talks is a “safe space,’\nwhere it is ok to express your vulnerability (most speakers on our panel address\nnot only their past challenges, but also the current pressing issues), and to ask the\ncommunity for support and guidance. We also hope that as our community grows,\nour members meet future business partners, advisors, investors, and friends.\n\n)\n\nAfter attending many business events in NYC and internationally, | have noticed\nthat women are less likely to network and introduce themselves than their male\npeers. That’s why, at every event that we host we try to make curated\nintroductions and make sure that each guest meets at least three people relevant\nto her business.\n\nPart of the inspiration for WE Talks was birthed from a negative experience at a\npopular \"empowerment\" event. Share that story and how it motivated you to\nstart WE Talks.\n\nEver since | moved to NY, | have been searching for a community where | would\nfeel comfortable and could turn for guidance. A while ago, | attended a very\ninteresting and intellectually stimulating women summit aimed at empowering\nfemale founders and helping them scale up. As the second day of the conference\nwas coming to an end, the participants were encouraged to publicly express their\ntake always. After a long hesitation, | asked for the microphone. It was a big\nchallenge for me, being terrified of public speaking and English being only my third\nlanguage. | am not sure whether my manner of speaking, or my accent was the\nreason why the host cut me off after 10 seconds and asked to hurry. After not\ngetting the support | had been looking for from something that was described as\nthe most inclusive and friendly community, | decided to start my own. At WE Talks,\nwe are very inclusive and don’t make judgements based on your accent or physical\nappearance. If you are driven, ambitious, thoughtful, and giving - you are always\nwelcome here!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022267",
