All logical\nstatements can be translated into this form using a purely mechanical\nprocess. There is even a website that will do this for you. It’s useful but I\ndon't recommend it as entertainment!\n\nIn the example above, something exists in relation to the existence\nof something else: one person who loves another. Give me a name and I\ncan look up the person they love. This is simple. A computer can easily\nsolve such problems. Indeed there are hundreds of websites doing this\nevery day. Once you've solved one problem of this type, you have solved\nthem all.\n\nWe can rearrange Diophantine equations into many different\nprenex forms. The simplest form might be, ‘there exists an x which solves\n\nthe following equation, x equals three? This would be written out as Ix,\nx=3 and is of the 4 class — ‘there exists. There are slightly more complex\nclasses than our simple 4 relationship: VV ‘for all, there exists for all’ or\nthe class V°V ‘for all, for all, there exists, for all: Each of these groups of\nequation is called a ‘reduction class.\n\nOne way to think about a reduction class is as a problem in topology,\n\n‘knots, to non-mathematicians. Imagine someone handed you a bunch\nof tangled cables - the sort of mess you get when they are thrown\nhaphazardly into a drawer. You can tease them apart and rearrange\nthem but you must not cut them or break any connection. Once you\nhave done this you will be left with a series of cables on the desk. They\nare all separate, looped or in someway knotted together. Each cable has\na fundamental topological arrangement: straight cables, granny knots,\nfigure eight, and so on. You have reduced them to their simplest form,\ntheir logical classes. The same goes for logical statements. Once you\nhave rearranged logical statements into their simplest form you can lay\nthem out and group them together according to their complexity. Each\ngroup makes up a reduction class and you can ask whether that class as a\nwhole is automatically decidable. It isa huge task to untangle and classify\nmathematical problems, and it took Robinson and her colleagues nearly\nforty years to succeed.\n\nIt turns out problems with a form as simple as VAV (for all,\nthere exists, for all) have no general purpose algorithm. Each must be\n\nexamined individually and solved by something that is not a computer.\n\nThis is a remarkable result as the logic boundary is set quite low. An 44,\n(exists, exists), class of problem is automatically solvable by a general\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015939",
