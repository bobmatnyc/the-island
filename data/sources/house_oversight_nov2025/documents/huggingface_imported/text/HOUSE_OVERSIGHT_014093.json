For example, on the same CNN program on January 5,\nDershowitz stated: “No, never met her [Jane Doe No. 3], I didn’t know what she looked like until\nI saw her photograph. . . . I have a superb memory. I have a memory of not having met her. J\ndid not meet her. And believe me, I remember everybody I’ve ever had sex with... . I can prove\nit by flight records. I can prove it by my travel records.” Id. (emphasis added). Dershowitz\nwent on to say that disproving Jane Doe No. 3’s allegations was a simple task requiring about\none hour of work: “If they [Edwards and Cassell] had just done an hours’ worth of work, they\nwould have seen she is lying through her teeth.” Jd.\n\nThat same day, on NBC’s Today Show, Dershowitz repeated his claim that it was a\nsimple matter to collect documents disproving allegations made by Jane Doe No. 3:\n\nHer lawyers Paul Cassell, a former Federal judge and Brad Edwards, deliberately\n\nand willfully filed this pleading which they knew I had no opportunity to respond\n\nto in court, without doing any investigation, if they had simply investigated the\n\nmanifests of the airplanes, if they had checked my travel records, if they had\n\nasked me and I could have given the names of these people who are witnesses,\nthey would know the stories, totally, completely false.\n\nhttps:/Awww.youtube.com/watch? v=ZXePK Tws0f0\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014093",
