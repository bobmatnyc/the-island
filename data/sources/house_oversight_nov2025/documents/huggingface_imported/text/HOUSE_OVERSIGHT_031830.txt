Who Maimed the Economy, and How

By A. O. SCOTT
“Inside Job,” a sleek, briskly paced film whose title suggests a heist movie, is the story of a crime without
punishment, of an outrage that has so far largely escaped legal sanction and societal stigma. The betrayal
of public trust and collective values that Mr. Ferguson chronicles was far more brazen and damaging than

the adultery in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s novel, which treated Hester more as scapegoat than villain.

The gist of this movie, which begins in a mood of calm reflection and grows angrier and more incredulous
as it goes on, is unmistakably punitive. The density of information and the complexity of the subject
matter make “Inside Job” feel like a classroom lecture at times, but by the end Mr. Ferguson has
summoned the scourging moral force of a pulpit-shaking sermon. That he delivers it with rigor, restraint

and good humor makes his case all the more devastating.
