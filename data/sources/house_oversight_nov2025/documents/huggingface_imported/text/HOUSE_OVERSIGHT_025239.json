As shown below, earnings revisions have been negative\nfor 2012, but analysts are still optimistic about 2013. According to Morgan Stanley, analysts are forecasting the highest\n\npercentage of companies posting 2013 margin expansion since 1970, and by a very wide margin. In our view, it will be\n\ndifficult for multiples to rise further unless earnings outperform expectations, particularly if Europe’s structural problems\ntake center stage again.\n\nRevisions to consensus EPS by quarter\nIndex, 12/30/2011 = 100\n\n101\n\n4QE+1%\n100\n\nSQE -1%\n99\n\nFYI2-1%\na8 2QE -2%\nof\n\n1QE -3%\n\nO68\n12/30/2011 OVSV2012 O2/2o/2012 OS282012\nSource: FactSet\n\nThe place that worries me the most: Spain. It ranks at or close to the bottom in a lot of categories (see table), and its\ngrowth outlook is poor. Historically, this kind of thing has not ended well. Spain has defaulted 13 times since 1500 AD;\nit’s probably going to take a lot of bilateral aid and ECB financing to prevent another one.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025239",
