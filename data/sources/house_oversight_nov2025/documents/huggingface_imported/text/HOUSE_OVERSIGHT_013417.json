I've never seen or heard of the procedure that was set up here.\" said McCabe, who has no\ninvolvement in any Epstein litigation and is now a securities litigation attorney.\n\n\"He's essentially avoiding federal prosecution because he can afford to pay that many lawyers to help those victims\nreview their cases.... If a person has no money he couldn't be able to strike a deal like this and avoid federal\nprosecution.”\n\nThe back-room deal with federal prosecutors all the more interesting in light of the legal heavyweights who have\nworked for Epstein, including Harvard professor Alan Dershowitz and Kenneth Starr of Clinton impeachment fame.\nLefcourt is a past president of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\n\nEpstein's local defense attorney, Jack Goldberger, issued a statement Friday saying he had fought the release of\nthe sealed agreement to protect the third parties named there. \"Mr. Epstein has fully abided by all of its terms and\nconditions. He is looking forward to putting this difficult period in his life behind him. He is continuing his long\nstanding history of science philanthropy...”\n\nEpstein ended up avoiding federal charges, and pleaded guilty in state court to felony solicitation of prostitution and\nprocuring a person under the age of 18 for prostitution. In July 2008, he was sentenced to 18 months in jail, and\nlater allowed out up to six days a week on work release.\n\nEpstein left the jail in late July 2009 after serving not quite 13 months of the sentence, having earned gain time for\ngood behavior.\n\nPalm Beach Police began investigating the \"international moneyman of mystery,” as the New York magazine\ndubbed him, after they received a complaint from a relative of a 14-year-old girl who had given Epstein a naked\nmassage at his home on the Intracoastal Waterway.\n\nPolice sought and found in poor neighborhoods a variety of tall, thin, model-like young women, who told stories of\nbegin recruiting, then going to Epstein's home and massaging and stimulating him. They walked away with between\n$200 and $1,000.\n\nThe investigation triggered tensions between police and prosecutors, with then-Chief Michael Reiter saying in a\nMay 2006 letter to then-State Attorney Barry Krischer that the chief prosecutor should disqualify himself.\n\n\"| continue to find your office's treatment of these cases highly unusual,” Reiter wrote. He then asked for and got\nthe federal investigation that ended in the sealed deal.\n\n\"The Jeffrey Epstein matter was an experience of what a many-million-dollar defense can accomplish,\" Reiter told\nthe Palm Beach Daily News upon his retirement.\n\nhttp://www.palmbeachpost.com/pbcwest/content/local_news/epaper/2009/09/18/0918epstein.html\n\n4/6/11 1:38 PM\n\nNea\n\nRick Heidy Vero Debra Robin\nAudrey Gabriel Jeffrey Katie Jodie\n\nRecent Activity\n[ Login | You need to be logged into Facebook to\nsee your friends’ activity\n\nCerabino: Florida House GOP's ‘uterus’\nban: A free-speech battle is born\n\n1,518 people shared this.\n\nForeclosure crisis: Fed-up judges crack\n‘ down disorder in the courts\n\n207 people shared this.\n\n| | Facebook social plugin\n\nPOSTPIX » Latest news photos\n\na\ne..
