  "text": "In addition to Prince Andrew as a British hot button, first\nconnected to Epstein through Roberts’ interview with the Daily Mail in\n2010, Clinton takes on a new role as Hillary spoiler through his\nconnection, real or imagined, to Epstein and sex slaves.\n\nAlmost everybody identified in any story about Epstein is\napproached by other media seeking to write about Epstein, often with\nfinancial incentives.\n\nNo new details emerge. Every aspect of the current story is\nbased on court filings describing events that may or may not have\ntaken place prior to 2007.\n\nA recent Reuters story identified a charity that Epstein has not\ngiven money to in 15 years that said if he does give again, they would\ngive it back.\n\nThe world cleanly divides, with Epstein (and friends) behind\nsecure walls and the Mail and social media and upholders of new\nnorms, ever more incredulous and apoplectic that Epstein not only\nwalks free but prospers too. Although he has spent more than a year\nin jail and paid out what may be as much as $20 million, he yet\nseems somehow to have gotten away with it—that worst sin of all. He\nis the unrepentant catch all of up-to-the-minute badness: the financier\nwhose wealth is a product of Wall Street math rather than work; a rich\nmiddle-age white man who not only parades his wealth and\nentitlement, but has a Peter Pan complex to boot; an insistent\nPlayboy in a correct and prudish world; someone who somehow\ndidn't get the memo about vast changes in mores and culture.\n\nWhen | suggested recently that one obvious way to blunt the\nanimus is to get married, he said he would rather go back to jail.\n\nHe is Calvin Harris’s song, It Was Acceptable in the 80s, come\nto life.\n\nThis is all, inevitably, a Gatsby-like story. But Gatsby in New\nYork Post and Daily Mail parlance would likely be a freaky financier\ntoo.\n\nAnd it’s a story about the limitation of journalism, in which the\nmost compelling parts of the story—it would take a long running cable\nshow to do justice to the meaning of Epstein’s ambitions and\nimpulses—need to be sacrificed for not just moral certainty but for a\nrather preposterous fantasy of moral certainty.\n\nAnyway, | hope | get invited back to Jeffrey’s house.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022725",
