  "text": "to Robert DeNiro. We even applauded Bob putting his handprints in cement in front of Grauman's Chinese\nTheater.\n\nThe conversations continued about how our government put the cabasch on \"Zero Dark Thirty\" with their\narrogant denial of enhanced interrogation. Even MPAA President Chris Dodd could not help Mark Boal,\nKatherine Bigalow and Amy Pascal.\n\nAdditional chatter was the renewed last minute love for \"Les Miserables\". Clearly the most polarizing\nfilm in the race, this 27 year old theatrical musical seen by 60 million fans is now the talk of the\nOscar weekend.\n\nHugh Jackman, Anne Hathaway, Russell Crowe, Amanda Segfried, Eddie Redmayne, Sasha Baron Cohen, Helena\nBonham Carter and Samanthe Barks are making an historic one time live performance as part of Sunday's\ntelevision broadcast. Producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron's will attempt to razzel dazzel us with an\nhomage to movie musicals for three plus hours at the Dolby theater.\n\nBarbra Streisand, Adele and Shirley Basse's appearances also create high anxiety and a blood bath for\ntickets...hence the hysteria created by Dreamworks’ messenger cutting the line.\n\nAfter checking into the iconic Beverly Hills Hotel, my home away from home for 30 years of Oscar weekends\nand meticulously laying out all the ensembles sent from Valentino and Ralph Rucci, I hit the party\ncircuit overdressed for life.\n\nDaisy... I can do this...fairly easily now...but I have a lunch at 12:30pm and important meetings. I am\nso distraught about all this pressure. I am calling you now. Peggy\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031119",
