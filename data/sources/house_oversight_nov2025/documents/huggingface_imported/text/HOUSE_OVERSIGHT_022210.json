A former business partner,\nSteven Hoffenberg, sued him in 2016, clairm-\ning that Epstein was the mastermind behinda\n$500 million Ponzi scheme that Hoffenberg was\nimprisoned for in 1995.\n\nHoffenberg served 18 years forthe scam, but\nhe later dropped the lawsuit against Epstein.\n\nIn August, two of Hoffenberg’s former inves-\ntors rekindled the lawsuit against Epstein, but the\ncase was dropped in October.\n\nEpstein and his associate, British-born socialite\nGhislaine Maxwell, were alsoaccused in a 2015\nfederal civil suit of organizing underage sex par-\nties on his private plane, nicknamed “The Lolita\nExpress,” and at Epstein’s various homes.\n\nMaxwell, who has never been charged with\nwrongdoing, has denied allegations made in\n\nJeffrey Epstein\n\nthe lawsuit that she was Epstein’s “madam.”\nThe suit, filed by victim Virginia Roberts, was\nsettled in 2017.\n\nIt was Epstein’s contacts with powerful and\n\nfamous people that first propelled him into the\npublic spotlight. In 2002, he flew former Presi-\ndent Bill Clinton, actor Kevin Spacey, comedian\nChris Tucker and others to South Africa on his\nprivate jet as part of a fact-finding AIDS mission\nin support of the Clinton Foundation.\n\nBut Epstein, a Clinton donor who contributed\nhundreds of thousands of dollars to Democratic\ncandidates and causes, realized that his Demo-\ncratic connections weren't going to help him in\n2006, when the federal prosecutor was Acosta,\n\na conservative Republican appointed during the\nGeorge W. Bush administration.\n\nAll-star attomeys\n\nEpstein’s tactic: hire the most aggressive and\npolitically connected lawyers that his money\ncould buy.\n\nAt the top of his list: Kenneth Starr, a Repub-\nlican icon because of his pursuit of Bill Clinton\nduring the Whitewater investigation, which led\nto the impeachment (but not conviction) of the\npresident after it was revealed he had sex with a\nyoung White House intern.\n\nLike Acosta, Starr had worked at the presti-\ngious law firm Kirkland & Ellis. Epstein also\ntapped Jay Lefkowitz, also of Kirkland, who\nworked as a domestic policy adviser and later as\na special envoy to North Korea during the George\nW. Bush presidency.\n\nEpstein also hired Bruce Reinhart, then an\nassistant U.S. attomey in Palm Beach.\n\nFite photo by MIAM! HERALD\n\nReinhart, now a U.S.\nmagistrate, left the U.S.\nAttorney’s Office on Jan.\n\n1, 2008, and went to work\nrepresenting Epstein's\nemployees on Jan. 2, 2008,\ncourt records show.\n\nIn 201.1, Reinhart was\nnamed in the Crime Victims’\nRights Act lawsuit, which ac-\ncused him of violating Justice\nDepartment policies by switching sides, implying\nthat he leveraged inside information about Ep-\nstein’s investigation to curry favor with Epstein.\n\nReinhart, in a sworn declaration attached\nto the Crime Victims’ Rights Act case, denied\nthe allegation, saying he did not participate in\nEpstein’s criminal case and “never learned any\nconfidential, non-public information about the\nEpstein matter”\n\nThe U.S. Attorney’s Office has since disputed\nthat, saying in court papers that he did possess\nconfidential information about the case.\n\nContacted for this story, Reinhart, in an\nemail, said he never represented Epstein — only\nEpstein’s pilots; his scheduler, Sarah Kellen; and\nNadia Marcinkova, described by some victims\nas Epstein'’s sex slave. Reinhart also pointed out\nthat a complaint filed against him by victims’\nlawyer Paul Cassell was dismissed by the\n\nKenneth Starr\n\nSee PERVERSION, next page\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022210",
