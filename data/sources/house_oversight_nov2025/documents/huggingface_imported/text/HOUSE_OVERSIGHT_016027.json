But the information I have transmitted is useless as it is, in\neffect, encrypted using a one-time pad. The only person in possession of\na copy of this one-time pad is me: the sender.\n\nClaude Shannon proved a one-time pad is unbreakable during the\nSecond World War. Yet the British succeeded in breaking it. How was\nthis possible?\n\nThe fatal weakness in the German one-time pads was the random\nnumbers used to code the messages were generated by a machine, and\nwere therefore not truly random. The numbers followed a sequence,\nand it was possible for Allied code breakers to work out the sequence\nand decode the messages. It follows that if we believe no message can\npropagate faster than the speed of light, my sequence of numbers must\nbe non-computable. There must be no algorithm or computation that\ncould generate it. Otherwise it would be liable to the same sort of\ndecryption attack that the one-time pads suffered. If sequences of random\nmeasurements taken in the universe are non-computable it follows the\nUniverse as a whole must be non-computable.\n\nThere are a few holes you could pick in this argument. Would it\nbe sufficient if it were impossible to decrypt the message in the age of\nthe Universe? What if there was an algorithm, but it was practically\nunknowable? But, I am talking here of principle. In principle, the\nUniverse must be non-decryptable.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016027",
