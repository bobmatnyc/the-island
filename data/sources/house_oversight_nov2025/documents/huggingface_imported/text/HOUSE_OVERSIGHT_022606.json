No. 95-114],\navailable at http ://www.justice.gov/' criminal/fraud/ fcpa/ history/ 1977/\nsenaterpt-95-114.pdf.\n* Id; H.R. Rep. No. 95-640, at 4-5 (1977) [hereinafter H. R. Rep. No.\n95-640], available at http ://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/\nhistory/1977/houseprt-95-640.pdf. ‘The House Report made clear\nCongress's concerns:\n\nThe payment of bribes to influence the acts or\n\ndecisions of foreign officials, foreign political parties\n\nor candidates for foreign political office is unethical.\n\nIt is counter to the moral expectations and values of\n\nthe American public. But not only is it unethical, it\n\nis bad business as well. It erodes public confidence\n\nin the integrity of the free market system. It short-\n\ncircuits the marketplace by directing business to\n\nthose companies too inefficient to compete in terms\n\nof price, quality or service, or too lazy to engage in\n\nhonest salesmanship, or too intent upon unloading\n\nmarginal products. In short, it rewards corruption\n\ninstead of efficiency and puts pressure on ethical\n\nenterprises to lower their standards or risk losing\n\nbusiness.\nTd.\n3 See, e.g, U.S. AGENCY FOR INT'L Dev., USAID ANTICORRUPTION\nSTRATEGY 5-6 (2005), available at http://transition.usaid.gov/policy/\nads/200/200mbo.pdf. The growing recognition that corruption poses\nasevere threat to domestic and international security has galvanized\nefforts to combat it in the United States and abroad. See, CLs Intl Anti-\nCorruption and Good Governance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-309,\n§ 202, 114 Stat. 1090 (codified as amended at 22 US.C. §§ 2151-2152\n(2000)) (noting that “[w]idespread corruption endangers the stability\nand security of societies, undermines democracy, and jeopardizes the\nsocial, political, and economic development ofa society. vee [and that]\n[clorruption facilitates criminal activities, such as money laundering,\nhinders economic development, inflates the costs of doing business, and\nundermines the legitimacy of the government and public trust”).\n4 See Maryse Tremblay & Camille Karbassi, Corruption and Human\nTrafficking 4 (Transparency Int'l, Working Paper No. 3,201 1), available\nat http: //issuu.com/ transparencyinternational/ docs/ ti-working_paper_\nhuman_trafficking 28 _jun_2011; U.S. AGENCY FoR INT’L Dev.\nFOREIGN AID IN THE NATIONAL INTEREST 40 (2002), available at\nhttp://pdfusaid.gov/pdf_docs/PDABW900.pdf (“No problem does\nmore to alienate citizens from their political leaders and institutions,\nand to undermine political stability and economic development, than\nendemic corruption among the government, political party leaders,\njudges, and bureaucrats. The more endemic the corruption is, the more\n\nEndnotes\n\nlikely itis to be accompanied by other serious deficiencies in the rule of\nlaw: smuggling, drug traficking, criminal violence, human rights abuses,\nand personalization of power.’).\n\n> President George W. Bush observed in 2006 that “the culture of\ncorruption has undercut development and good governance and\n\n.... impedes our efforts to promote freedom and democracy, end\npoverty, and combat international crime and terrorism.” President’s\nStatement on Kleptocracy, 2 Pus. Papers 1504 (Aug. 10, 2006),\navailable at http i//; georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/ news/\nreleases/2006/08/20060810.html. The administrations of former\nPresident George W. Bush and President Barack Obama both recognized\nthe threats posed to security and stability by corruption. For instance,\n\nin issuing a proclamation restricting the entry of certain corrupt foreign\npublic officials, former President George W. Bush recognized “the\nserious negative effects that corruption of public institutions has on the\nUnited States’ efforts to promote security and to strengthen democratic\ninstitutions and free market systems... .” Proclamation No. 7750, 69\nFed. Reg. 2287 (Jan. 14, 2004). Similarly, President Barack Obama's\nNational Security Strategy paper, released in May 2010, expressed the\nadministration’s efforts and commitment to promote the recognition that\n“pervasive corruption is a violation of basic human rights and a severe\nimpediment to development and global security.” THE WHITE House,\nNATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY 38 (2010), available at http://\nwww.whitehouse.gov/ sites/default/files/rss_viewer/ national_security_\nstrategy.pdf.\n\n6 See, C85 INT’L CHAMBER OF COMMERCE, ET AL., CLEAN BUSINESS\nIs Goop BusINEss: THE BUSINESS CASE AGAINST CORRUPTION\n(2008), available at http ://www.unglobalcompact.org/docs/news_\nevents/8.1/ clean_business_is_good_business. pdf; ; World Health Org.,\nFact Sheet No. 335, Medicines: Corruption and Pharmaceuticals (Dec.\n2009), available at http ://wwwowho.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs335/\nen/; Daniel Kaufmann, Corruption: The Facts, FOREIGN Por’y, Summer\n1997, at 119-20; Paolo Mauro, Corruption and Growth, 110 Q.
