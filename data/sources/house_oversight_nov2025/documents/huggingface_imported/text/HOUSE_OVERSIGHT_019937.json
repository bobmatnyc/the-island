  "text": "anybody else now serving in the White House. She and Jared, or Jared, but by inference\nshe, too, were in effect the real chief of staff—or certainly as much a chief of staff as\nPriebus or Bannon, all of them reporting directly to the president. Or, even more to the\norganizational point, Jared and Ivanka had a wholly independent standing inside the West\nWing. A super status. Even as Priebus and Bannon tried, however diplomatically, to\nremind the couple of staff procedures and propriety, they would in turn remind the West\nWing leadership of their overriding First Family prerogatives. In addition, the president\nhad immediately handed Jared the Middle East portfolio, making him one of the\nsignificant international players in the administration—indeed, in the world. In the first\nweeks, this brief extended out to virtually every other international issue, about which\nnothing in Kushner’s previous background would have prepared him for.\n\nKushner’s most cogent reason for entering the White House was “leverage,” by which\nhe meant proximity. Quite beyond the status of being inside the family circle, anyone who\nhad proximity to the president had leverage, the more proximity the more leverage. Trump\nhimself you could see as a sort of Delphic oracle, sitting in place and throwing out\npronouncements which had to be interpreted. Or as an energetic child, and whomever\ncould placate or distract him became his favorite. Or as the Sun God (which is effectively\nhow he saw himself), the absolute center of attention, dispensing favor and delegating\npower, which could, at any moment, be withdrawn. The added dimension was that this\nSun God had little calculation. His inspiration existed in the moment, hence all the more\nreason to be there with him in the moment. Bannon, for one, joined Trump for dinner\nevery night, or at least made himself available—one bachelor there for the effective other\nbachelor. (Priebus would observe that in the beginning everyone would try to be part of\nthese dinners, but within a few months, they had become a torturous duty to be avoided.)\n\nPart of Jared and Ivanka’s calculation about the relative power and influence of a\nformal job in the West Wing versus an outside advisory role was the knowledge that\ninfluencing Trump required you to be all in. From phone call to phone call—and his day,\nbeyond organized meetings, was almost entirely phone calls—you could lose him. The\nsubtleties here were immense, because while he was often most influenced by the last\nperson he spoke to, he did not actually listen to anyone. So it was not so much the force of\nan individual argument or petition that moved him, but rather more just someone’s\npresence, the connection of what was going through his mind—and although he was a\nperson of many obsessions, much of what was on his mind had no fixed view—to\nwhomever he was with and their views.\n\nUltimately Trump may not be that different in his fundamental solipsism from anyone\nof great wealth who has lived most of his life in a highly controlled environment. But one\nclear difference was that he had acquired almost no formal sort of social discipline—he\ncould not even attempt to imitate decorum. He could not really converse, for instance, not\nin the sense of sharing information, or of a balanced back-and-forth conversation. He\nneither particularly listened to what was said to him, nor particularly considered what he\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019937",
