  "text": "Crossfire’s progenitors thus ignored an obvious question: If Russia promised unspecified dirt on Mrs.\nClinton but never delivered it, how would that amount to collusion with the Trump campaign? If\nanything, such behavior suggests an attempt to entice and potentially embarrass Mr. Trump by\n\ndangling the prospect of compromising information and getting his aides to jump at it.\n\nGiven the paucity of evidence, it’s staggering that the FBI would initiate a counterintelligence\ninvestigation, led by politically biased staff, amid a presidential campaign. The aggressive methods and\nsubsequent leaking only strengthen that conclusion. If the FBI sincerely believed Trump associates\nwere Russian targets or agents, the proper response would have been to inform Mr. Trump so that he\n\ncould protect his campaign and the country.\n\nMr. Trump’s critics argue that the claim of political bias is belied by the fact that Crossfire was not\nleaked before the election. In fact, there were vigorous, successful pre-election efforts to publicize the\nTrump-Russia collusion narrative. Shortly after Crossfire’s launch, CIA Director John Brennan and Mr.\nComey briefed Congress, triggering predictable leaking. Christopher Steele and his patrons embarked\n\non a media roadshow, making their dossier something of an open secret in Washington.\n\nOn Aug. 29, 2016, the New York Times published a letter to Mr. Comey from Senate Minority Leader\nHarry Reid, saying he’d learned of “evidence of a direct connection between the Russian government\nand Donald Trump’s presidential campaign,” which had “employed a number of individuals with\nsignificant and disturbing ties to Russia and the Kremlin.” On Aug. 30, the ranking Democratic\nmembers of four House committees wrote a public letter to Mr. Comey requesting “that the FBI assess\nwhether connections between Trump campaign officials and Russian interests” may have contributed\nto the DNC hack so as “to interfere with the U.S. presidential election.” On Sept. 23, Yahoo News’s\nMichael Isikoff reported the Hill briefings and the Steele dossier’s allegations regarding Carter Page.\nOn Oct. 30, Harry Reid again publicly wrote Mr. Comey: “In my communications with you and other\ntop officials in the national security community, it has become clear that you possess explosive\ninformation about close ties and coordination between Donald Trump, his top advisors, and the Russian\n\ngovernment.”\n\nThat these leaking efforts failed to prevent Mr. Trump’s victory, or that Mr. Comey’s ham-fisted\ninterventions might have also hurt Mrs. Clinton’s electoral prospects, does not diminish the legal\n\nsignificance of the anti-Trump bias shown by government officials.\n\nThe totality of the circumstances creates the appearance that Crossfire was politically motivated. Since\nan attempt by federal law enforcement to influence a presidential election “shocks the conscience,” any\n\nprosecutorial effort derived from such an outrageous abuse of power must be suppressed.
