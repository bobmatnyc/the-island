  "text": "Remembering George Carlin\n\nGeorge Carlin died in June 2008. He was a generous friend. When |\nperformed in Los Angeles, he sent a limousine to pick me up at the airport,\nand | stayed at his home. And such a sweet man. When | opened for him\nat the Warner-Grand Theater in San Pedro, we were hanging around in his\ndressing room, where he was nibbling from a vegetable plate. | watched as\nhe continued to be genuinely gracious with every fan who stopped by. If\nthey wanted his autograph, he would gladly sign his name. If they wanted\nto be photographed with him, he would assume the pose. If they wanted\nto have a little chat, he indulged them with congeniality.\n\n| said, “You really show respect for everybody.”\n\n“Well,” he responded, “that's just the way / would want to be\ntreated.”\n\nAs a performer, Carlin was uncompromising, knowing that his\naudience trusted him not to be afraid of offending them. In fact, he was\nexcited by that possibility. The day before one of his live HBO specials, he\ncalled and told me to be sure and watch it, because he would devote the\n\nfirst ten minutes of his performance to the subject of abortion.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015379",
