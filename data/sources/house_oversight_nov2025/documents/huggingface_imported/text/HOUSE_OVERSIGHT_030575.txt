“T’ve got a story idea for you. The rebuilding of Indonesia. Or New Orleans. Or both. Go there. I’ve just been. You will
never think the same way about anything again.”

So spoke not Bill or Melinda Gates, but Ghislaine Maxwell, the 48-year-old woman being written up everywhere at
the moment as the alleged “procurer” of young women for billionaire Jeffrey Epstein.

Epstein, 57, is the financier who spent a year in jail on charges of soliciting prostitutes—and now there is talk of
another investigation because various women, now in their twenties and thirties, have come forward with allegations
that he molested them when they were under-age. The allegations first surfaced in British newspapers, which have
zeroed in on Epstein’s friendship with Prince Andrew, who has recently tried to publicly disassociate himself from his
old pal.

I wrote a piece for Vanity Fair in 2003 called “The Talented Mr. Epstein.” It was largely a business piece that focused
on his mysterious exit from Bear Stearns in 1981, his close relationships with Jimmy Cayne, Les Wexner, the
chairman of Limited Brands, and above all, the man who claimed to be his mentor, Steven Jude Hoffenberg, who is
currently serving a 20-year-jail sentence for bilking investors in Towers Financial out of $450 million.

The piece alluded to Epstein’s great friendship with Maxwell, and how she introduced him to young women with
whom he had sexual relationships. But, in the end, the story didn’t really go there, focusing instead on the issue that
remains a mystery—how Jeffrey made his money, and how Ghislaine made hers.

This is not to say I didn’t hear stories about the girls. I did. But, not knowing quite who to believe, I concentrated on

the intriguing financial mystery instead. But now the women have come back. Not the same ones, different ones. And
their stories are bone-chilling. Journalists from England have phoned—and, in one case, flown—to ask me about
