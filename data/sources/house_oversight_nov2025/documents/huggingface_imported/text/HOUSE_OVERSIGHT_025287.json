  "text": "Hedge funds\n\nUBS View Prefer Relative-value and Event-driven\n¢ We expect hedge funds (HF) to offer positive asymmetric return characteristics due to active risk\nmanagement and stop-loss strategies. On the active risk side of the equation, we have seen lower gross\nexposure and net-market exposure within the overall hedge funds group, with traders being cautiously\npositioned. With systemic risk at bay, we favor relative-value (RV ) and event-driven (ED) strategies.\n\n¢ The inherent hedging in relative value is appealing. Credit relative-value managers should perform well\nin this environment of higher fixed-income volatility and increasing pricing anomalies created by central\nbank interventions and limited competition.\n\n¢ While ED managers share some of the performance drivers, idiosyncratic bets reduce the correlation to\nmarkets. The real reason to own this strategy, however, is the potential for outsized returns in distressed,\nhigh-yield, and other credit investments as the Eurozone crisis plays out.\n\nA Positive scenario Prefer Equity long-short\n¢ Reduced uncertainty (e.g. resolution in Europe) lowers equities’ correlation and volatility. This helps\nbottom-up fundamental analysis and equity long/short managers the most. Also, CEOs will likely make\nmore corporate transactions that can be monetized by event-driven managers, and a clearer\nmacroeconomic environment with more persistent trends would support CTA managers.\n‘Negative scenario Prefer Trading (Global Macro + CTA)\n° So far this year, the market has remained plagued by short-term reversals, due to central banks’\nintervention and stimulus effects, an obstacle for trend-following managers. Still, if the European\ndeleveraging (or fiscal cliff, China hard landing) is unmanaged, this could threaten risky assets. Trading\ncan do well if such a scenario unfolds.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7).\n\nWhat we're Why it matters\nwatching\nGlobal equity direction/\n\neconomic cycle\n\nThe outlook for global equities is an important HF performance driver. The\neconomic cycle impacts the strategies differently.\n\nCorrelation Correlation is an important performance/alpha driver for equity long/short, the\nlargest HF strategy by assets under management.\n\nLeverage Gross and net leverage are key to monitoring risk.\n\nVolatility The direction influences certain HF strategies (e.g. convertible arbitrage).\n\nLiquidity Important in particular for large, less nimble HFs, it enables them to enter and\nexit their strategies.\n\nRegulation Volcker rule, USCITS III/IV\n\n2 UBS\n\nRecommendations\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\nRecommendation: Active risk\nmanagement is instrumental for capital\npreservation during adverse market\nconditions. At the moment, we therefore\nfavor relative-value and event-driven\nstrategies, since they are less correlated to\nequity markets and other risky assets than\ntrading.\n\nValue proposition: Hedge funds should\nachieve robust performance over an\nextended horizon, while displaying\nlimited volatility vis-a-vis equities and\nother risky assets. Hedge funds try to\nminimize downside losses in adverse\nmarket conditions (e.g. active risk\nmanagement), which plays a crucial role in\nwealth appreciation. Similarly, hedge fund\nmanagers attempt to capture most of the\nupside of risky assets owning to valid\nvalue preposition.\n\nPerformance, year-to-date\n\nRelative value\n\nEquity hedge\n\nHedge Funds\n\n“2.0% -15% -1.0% 0.5% 0.0% 05% 1.0% 15% 20% 25% 30% 35% 4.0% 4.5% 5.0% 5.5%\n\nSource: HFRI, UBS, as of 31 Sep 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\nFor further information please contact ClO's asset class specialist Cesare Valeggia, cesare.valeggia@ubs.com\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025287",
