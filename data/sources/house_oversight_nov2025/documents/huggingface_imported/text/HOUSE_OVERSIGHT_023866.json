  "text": "120 Teaching Minds\n\nhow best to throw a rock in order to hit the cat. For many of these\nthings, hypotheses can be formed, discussions about what makes a\ngood hypothesis can be had, and ideas for testing out hypotheses can\nbe sought. Maybe these would just be thought experiments (as in the\ncase of hitting the cat), but thought experiments are important also.\nKnowing what would confirm or deny a hypothesis is important.\nFinding out what kids want to get better at is part of the issue here.\nIf they want to learn to hit a baseball, having a theory about what\nmakes a good swing and what makes a bad one may matter to them.\nThe subject matter doesn’t matter at all really, just the thinking and\nthe experimentation.\n\nThis suggests that the real way to teach experimentation and the\nother subjects we have discussed here is to group kids not by age but\nby interests. So, if a child wants to think about dogs all day, group him\nwith a set of other dog lovers and start coming up with hypotheses\nabout dogs’ behavior, needs, commands that they might learn, train-\ning, breeding, and so on. It just doesn’t matter what the subject is at\nthis stage.\n\nSuggestions for kids’ science experiments are everywhere. Here is\na typical one:\n\nGravity\n\nThe Earth tries to pull everything down toward its center. This\npull is called the force of gravity (the invisible force). When you\nlift things up, you have to pull against gravity. If you drop a\npencil, gravity pulls it to Earth. If you rest its midpoint on your\nfinger, gravity will pull down equally on both sides of the pencil\nand it will balance in the air.\n\nHere is another:\nSound and Noise\nHave one person fill each of the plastic eggs with a different item.\nPut some rice in one, some dried beans in another, and so on.\n\nKeep track of what you put in each egg by writing numbers on\nthe eggs. Have a different person try to see if he can figure out\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023866",
