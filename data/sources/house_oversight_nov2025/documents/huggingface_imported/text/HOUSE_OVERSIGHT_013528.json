This was followed\nby detailed discussion of everything we’d seen and heard. |’d ask them to predict\nwhat we’d find in the many pages of personal interviews and nurses observations in\nthe clinic chart. The student psychiatrists with the most street smarts, called\nemotional intelligence by Daniel Goleman, were particularly quick at shadowing and\nthus predicting the patient’s global dynamical pattern.\n\nDo personality patterns exist? Evidence from biometric studies of the\nhereditary aspects of personality style in animals and humans suggest that\nrelatively few global component properties underlie a variety of complicated-looking\nmanifestations of behavioral style. Primary colors are the source of all hues.\nHarvard psychologist, Jerome Hagen, has reviewed the history of this idea in his\nbook, Galen’s Prophecy. While there are differences among personality research\nprograms, almost all rating scale and questionnaire-based studies result in clusters\nof traits that reflect statistically associated properties which when taken together are\ncalled temperament. This idea is close to what we mean by personality. These\nrelatively few response clusters are given descriptive names such as introversion,\nextroversion, neuroticism, impulsivity, sociability, task persistence and tolerance of\nambiguity. As defined by psychological inventories, studies of families show that\nthese styles are heritable in the range of 60%.\n\nHans Eysenck, in over four decades of work and more than 5000 published\npapers from London’s Maudsley Hospital, derived common global factors of\npersonality using questionnaires. The best known was called the Eysenck\nPersonality Inventory. His studies resulted in evidence for only a few fundamental\nbehavioral axes, behavioral manifolds, which describe extremal properties of\npersonality types analogous to stable and unstable manifolds: introversion-\nextroversion, shyness-sociability, low and high activity level and emotional\nconstriction versus impulsivity.\n\nTo make the issue of personality as dynamical system more realistically\ncomplex, we can call on some examples of the rich history of behavioral genetic\nstudies using animals such as the mouse. They can be selectively bred for\n\nunderlying personality factors, such as dominance, fear, aggression or exploratory\n\n28\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013528",
