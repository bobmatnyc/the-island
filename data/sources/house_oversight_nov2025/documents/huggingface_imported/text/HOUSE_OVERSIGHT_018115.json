They begin taking\nconcrete steps along the path that they think will get them to that end.\nThey learn far too slowly that what they initially thought they knew\nwas in fact wrong or no longer relevant. .. . Things can get much\nmore convoluted by adding allies, different influential actors among\nthe polity, and multiple adversaries. This is why wars are easier to get\ninto than out of.15\n\nKnowing when to end a war relates to war aims and measures of\nsuccess. A war’s aims should be definitive enough so that success can\nbe measured in some clear way. This is easiest to do where the aims\nconcern discrete things such as the destruction of material targets.\nMeasuring success becomes harder as aims become more political\nand psychological, such as weakening or toppling a regime,\nencouraging opposition or deterring further action. Then, too, war\naims can expand as fighting escalates or broadens. In a situation in\nwhich Iran has retaliated strongly and managed to inflict losses\n(especially civilian losses) on the United States or its coalition\npartners, we should expect to hear calls to inflict more damage, to\npunish the regime and its forces, to bring a “decisive” end to the\nconflict.\n\nShort of inflicting a total defeat on Iran, an outcome that seems\nscarcely conceivable, exiting the war could be challenging if Iran\nchooses to fight on in some form of asymmetric conflict. We might\nthen have to compel Iran to quit, and that could potentially require\nthe application of force well beyond what was originally agreed upon\nwithin the United States or with coalition partners. Even then, if the\nIranian regime survives at all, it is likely to declare victory, and many\nof its supporters would believe it. How or when a war with Iran\nwould actually end is therefore no easy topic to nail down. Any attack\non Iran of sufficient scale to significantly damage its nuclear program\nwould have rolling consequences both in the short and long term.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018115",
