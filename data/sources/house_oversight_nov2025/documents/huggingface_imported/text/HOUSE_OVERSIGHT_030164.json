  "text": "B\n\nsubservient status. This may explain why al Assad felt the need to\nstress in his speech that his minority government would not take\n\"revenge\" against those who stand down from their protests.\n\nTurkey is understandably nervous about what is happening next door\nin Syria. Ankara would prefer a Syria ruled by a stable Sunni regime,\nespecially one that would look to Turkey's ruling Justice and\nDevelopment Party (AKP) for political guidance. However, the Turks\ncan see that Alawite leadership will not leave power without a long\nand bloody fight. Recreating a sphere of Turkish-modeled Sunni\ninfluence in the Levant may be a long-term goal for Ankara, but the\nTurkish government is certainly not prepared to pay the near-term\ncost of civil strife in Syria spilling across Turkish borders.\n\nTurkey has so far addressed this dilemma mainly through rhetoric,\nissuing angry speeches against Syrian leadership, while floating the\nidea of a military buffer zone for Syrian refugees. For awhile,\nassuming the role of regional disciplinarian played well to an AKP\npublic-relations strategy that portrayed Turkey as the model for the\nArab Spring and the go-to mediator for the Mideast's problems. But\nthe more Syria destabilizes - and with each time it ignores Ankara's\ndemands - the more Turkey risks appearing impotent.\n\nThe crisis in Syria will likely lead to a recalibration of Turkish\nforeign policy. The architect of Turkey's foreign policy, Foreign\nMinister Ahmet Davutoglu, coined the phrase \"zero problems with\nneighbors\" to describe the guiding principle of Turkey's interactions\nwith surrounding regimes. Turkey obviously has a problem with\nSyria's leadership, and not a small one. It is becoming increasingly\napparent that Turkey may not yet have what it takes to deal with\nSyria, beyond issuing rhetorical censures. Establishing a military\nbuffer zone as a safe haven for Syrian refugees not only would call\nfor an international mandate, but would entail Turkish troops\noccupying foreign land - which would likely set off alarm bells\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030164",
