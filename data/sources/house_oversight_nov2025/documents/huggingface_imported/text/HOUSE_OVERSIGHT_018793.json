  "text": "Las Vegas Retail Via\n\nOverview\n\nThe Las Vegas Strip has historically outperformed competitive U.S. retail markets and continues to experience very strong absorption of\nnew construction, low vacancy rates, and an abundance of retail tenants seeking to access high-traffic pedestrian locations. These factors\ntogether with controlled levels of new development will cause significant long-term rent increases across the submarket.\n\nIncreasing Levels of Visitor Spending — More than half of the 41 million visitors to Las Vegas each year spend time shopping along the Las\nVegas Strip. Average per capita visitor spending on shopping, dining and entertainment during 2014 was $815. As demonstrated in the\nexhibit below, consumers are allocating a larger percentage of their total spending on shopping and entertainment.\n\nECONOMIC VISITOR PROFILE 2008 - 2014\n\n2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014\nAverage number of adults in immediate Party 2.4 2.4 2.4 2.3 2.4 2.4 2.4\nProportion of visitors with persons under 21 in their immediate party 6.0% 8.0% 7.0% 10.0% 11.0% 10.0% 10.0%\nProportion of visitors who stayed overnight 99.6% 99.8% 99.3% 99.8% 99.7% 99.8% 99.6%\nDays stayed (average) 4.5 4.6 4.6 4.7 4.3 4.3 4.2\nNights stayed (average) 3.5 3.6 3.6 3.7 3.3 3.3 3.2\nProportion of visitors who stayed in a hotel or motel room 94.0% 96.0% 95.0% 95.0% 96.0% 96.0% 96.0%\nNumber of room occupants 2.1 2.1 2 2.1 2.1 2.2 2.1\nLodging expenditures (average per night) $101.68 $75.78 $79.64 $84.04 $93.13 $83.62 $86.55\nProportion of visitors who bought a package or travel group trip 15.0% 15.0% 16.0% 18.0% 14.0% 13.0% 18.0%\nAverage cost of package per person $746.69 $640.29 $651.02 $757.83 $743.65 $868.24 $815.14\nAverage trip expenditures of food and drink $273.39 $250.32 $256.82 $274.69 $256.11 $278.95 $281.88\nAverage trip expenditures for local transportation $59.26 $53.31 $62.87 $64.25 $57.77 $59.68 $68.83\nAverage trip expenditures for shopping $121.90 $101.97 $122.80 $129.34 $149.29 $140.90 $149.77\nAverage trip expenditures for shows $51.64 $39.87 $49.28 $47.52 $42.89 $38.45 $47.56\nAverage trip expenditures for sightseeing $7.12 $5.77 $7.21 $10.24 $9.63 $9.29 $14.49\nAverage trip gambling budget $531.98 $481.57 $466.20 $447.63 $484.70 $529.57 $530.11\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018793",
