I said ok, but ..... \" you told me to continue as we would work\nsomething out\" I told you my fee then was 40. feb you came with ben while kathy ruemmler was here. and\nsaid next week, debra got bad news. and I quickly prioritzed not adding stress to your situation. I wont\nregurgitate the interim, though millions of dollars were saved since. millions. . it is now one year later and you\npropose 10 mlllion , plus a contingent fee . [have said that i would work with you , and if contingent and a\npercentage of something. I strongly believe that is not in your interest. I continue to put our friendship first\nand dont want you to write a check for over 100million andthe i will have to listen to lewie for the next few\nyears. but if you prefer over my objection a percentage deal then it should be of all savings not just\n\nphaidon. ( arandom concept). The idea that 1 am somehow even marginally responsible for neither you nor\nheather , ever telling me that there was an unresolved issue, though you said you had been pinged a number of\ntimes is emblematic .\n\nI can do a call with you and Karp. anytime you like today, but ican assure you 100 percent that there is no\nlight between our positions.
