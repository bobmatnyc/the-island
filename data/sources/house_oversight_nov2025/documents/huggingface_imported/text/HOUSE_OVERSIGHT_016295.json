  "text": "concept of “Pareto-topia”: the idea that AI, if done right, can bring about a future in\nwhich everyone ’s lives are hugely improved, a future where there are no losers. A key\nrealization here is that what chiefly prevents humanity from achieving its full potential\nmight be our instinctive sense that we’re in a zero-sum game—a game in which players\nare supposed to eke out small wins at the expense of others. Such an instinct 1s seriously\nmisguided and destructive in a “game” where everything is at stake and the payoff is\nliterally astronomical. There are many more star systems in our galaxy alone than there\nare people on Earth.\n\nHope\n\nAs of this writing, I’m cautiously optimistic that the Al-risk message can save humanity\nfrom extinction, just as the Soviet-occupation message ended up liberating hundreds of\nmillions of people. As of 2015, it had reached and converted 40 percent of AI\nresearchers. It wouldn’t surprise me if a new survey now would show that the majority\nof AI researchers believe AI safety to be an important issue.\n\nI’m delighted to see the first technical Al-safety papers coming out of DeepMind,\nOpenAI, and Google Brain and the collaborative problem-solving spirit flourishing\nbetween the Al-safety research teams in these otherwise very competitive organizations.\n\nThe world’s political and business elite are also slowly waking up: AI safety has\nbeen covered in reports and presentations by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics\nEngineers (IEEE), the World Economic Forum, and the Organization for Economic\nCooperation and Development (OECD). Even the recent (July 2017) Chinese AI\nmanifesto contained dedicated sections on “AI safety supervision” and “Develop[ing]\nlaws, regulations, and ethical norms” and establishing “an AI security and evaluation\nsystem” to, among other things, “[e]nhance the awareness of risk.” I very much hope that\na new generation of leaders who understand the AI Control Problem and AI as the\nultimate environmental risk can rise above the usual tribal, zero-sum games and steer\nhumanity past these dangerous waters we are in—thereby opening our way to the stars\nthat have been waiting for us for billions of years.\n\nHere’s to our next hundred thousand years! And don’t hesitate to speak the truth,\neven if your voice trembles.\n\n75\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016295",
