On the one hand,\nthe primary story is one of longstanding underenforcement - a combination of explicit legal policies, practical evidence-\ngathering and proof challenges, and cultural biases resulted in a notoriously weak response to sexual assaults by state criminal\njustice systems. On the other hand, there is a story, over the last forty years or so, of wide-ranging success in achieving reforms\non several fronts - substantive and procedural law, institutional design, and resource allocation - designed to improve\nenforcement capacity. In other words, U.S. jurisdictions made substantial progress against an ingrained tradition of\nunderenforcement without turning to any model of enforcement redundancy - federalization, private prosecution, or judicial\nreview. That is more than state justice systems were ever able to do with regard to local government corruption, where the\nremedy instead was the rise of federal criminal law enforcement.\n\nAnd yet, few seem to consider this reform story a success. !*8 The data on underreporting by victims, low arrest rates by\npolice, and charging rates by prosecutors (along with the rape kit [*900] testing backlog) make it easy to view state criminal\njustice systems as failing to achieve adequate enforcement responses to sexual assaults despite the scope and gravity of the\nproblem - 124,000 offenses reported to police in 2015, and 431,000 assault reports estimated by the National Crime Victim\nSurvey. 189\n\nThis story of reform, its decidedly limited success, and the responses to that record all reveal insights about the prospects for\nredressing underenforcement through redundancy in this context. Intersecting feminist, victim rights, and rape-law-reform\nmovements have achieved some remarkable reforms through the political process over the last four decades. U.S. criminal\njustice, like U.S. public law generally, is responsive to popular sentiment, well-organized reform movements, and interest\ngroups. !?° But these movements never sought any mechanism of enforcement redundancy, and federal and state lawmakers\nnever seriously considered one. Even now, when offense definitions, victim rights, evidentiary rules, and organizational\nchanges in law enforcement agencies offer few plausible options for further improvement, there is effectively no sign of\ninterest in private prosecution and judicial or administrative oversight. Instead, the sole focus of further innovation to address\nendemic underenforcement of sexual assault offenses is the federal government. And most federal policy - and policy proposals\n- stop short of expanding federal law to cover sexual assaults now within the jurisdiction solely of state courts. !°! A notable\n\nD4 Linda R.S. v.
