China's big tech stocks have fallen into a bear
market at the same time that regulatory threats
against U.S. big tech companies are gaining
momentum. Can U.S. big tech stocks soldier on
alone or is this a harbinger that the group as a whole
is losing its tremendous leadership position?

In recent months, China’s BAT collapse has demonstrated how costly the expectation of
invincibility can be—Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent are all down more than 24%
from their year-to-date closing highs. Citigroup’s head of Asia strategy, Mohammed
Apabhai, told CNN an apt analogy about the investor sentiment that led to BAT’s collapse,
likening “the exuberance for tech stocks to the Looney Tunes cartoons in which Wile E.
Coyote chases Road Runner over a cliff.” Given they’ve more or less moved in
tandem for years, will FAANG follow the same path as BAT?

The BAT collapse was triggered by subpar earnings and a shifting regulatory environment
in China. Facebook’s miss in 2Q18—which drove a $120 billion single-day market cap
loss, the biggest ever for a U.S. company—showed how decisive a turn could be if more
U.S. tech darlings stumble this quarter.
