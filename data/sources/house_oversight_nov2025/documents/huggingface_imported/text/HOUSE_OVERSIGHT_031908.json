  "text": "33\n\nSHAFFER: Don’t bioethics pose a challenge to the idea that the best\nsociety is the most successful society? You argue in Our Posthuman\nFuture that a society that genetically engineered its children to be\nmore intelligent might be more productive and successful but\nwouldn’t be moral.\n\nFUKUYAMA: I’ve got a simpler concern in my current book. It’s\njust that liberal democracy is not something you can take for granted,\nor that democracies will find a way to solve their problems. I think\nwe’ ve got a number of long-term problems in the United States that\ndon’t seem to be getting addressed with the current political system.\n\nMatthew Shaffer is a William F. Buckley Fellow at the National\nReview Institute\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031908",
