It also shows the Maxwell legal \nteam's concern about the media coverage, especially from the Miami Herald, weeks before it published today's bombshell \ninvestigation today. \nMy questions are: \nWhat is your response to the Miami Herald story published today? \nHow would you respond to the series' allegations that there has been a more than decade-long cover-up of Epstein and \nhis powerful associates, including by Trump's current secretary of labor Alexander Acosta? \nPlease reply ASAP as I am on deadline. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022998 \nThank you, \nAdam Klasfeld \nReporter, Courthouse News \n(cell/Signal) \nPGP Fingerprint for personal email: F427 EE3B 6F05 E5D5 785B 775B 2C74 683C 219D 91DC \nTwitter: @KlasfeldReports Skype: \nwww.adamklasfeld.com  \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 022999",
