  "text": "South China Morning Post\n\nWednesday, April 25,2018 All\n\nINSIGHT\n\nLooming tech war\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn says the ZTE showdown points to a misunderstanding over motives\n\ns someone who works for US-\n\nChina understanding and\n\nroots for US-China partner-\n\nships, I've been concerned, but\n\nnot worried, over what others\nhave called “a looming trade war”. I've not\nworried because tariffs don’t work; they are\nbluntinstruments ina globalised economy,\npenalising American companies and\nconsumers as much as Chinese. Most\nAmerican experts oppose tariffs, and Presi-\ndent Donald Trump likes to make bigdeals\nafter making big threats.\n\nBut I am now worried over what I will\ncall “a looming tech war”, because the\nstructural imperatives fo deeper.\n\n‘As everyone who follows China knows,\nthe US Department of Commerce has im-\nposed a denial of export privileges\nagainst ZTE, China's second-largest tele-\ncommunications equipment manufactur-\ner, thus prohibiting US companies from\nselling essential electronic components\nand software to ZTE, a crippling sanction.\n\nChina has responded resolutely, with\nactions that seem selected from expert sce-\nnario planning, and with rhetoric, both in-\ndignation and nationalistic bravado.\n\nFrom China's perspective, according to\nits Ministry of Commerce, “If the United\nStates attempts to curb China's develop-\nment... it miscalculates. The action targets\nChina; however, it will ultimately under-\nmine the US itself,” affecting tens of thou-\nsands of jobs and hundreds of related US\nenterprises.\n\n“Targeting technology is like throttling\nthe neck of the Chinese enterprises,”\nwrote China Daily. “The ZTE case should\nremind China's decision-makers of the\nurgency to become self-sufficient in core\ntechnologies.\n\nPresident Xi Jinping has been prescient\nabout domestic control of core technol-\nogies, especially related to the internet and\nmore recently to artificial intelligence.\nSince taking office in 2012, he has stressed\nthe “hidden risks” that come with core\ntechnologies not being mastered domesti-\ncally. He said, “Heavy dependence on im-\nported core technology is like building our\nhouse on top of someone else's walls: no\nmatter how big and how beautiful it is, it\nwon't remain standing during a storm.”\nInnovation is the first of Xi’s “five major\nconcepts of development”.\n\nBeijing also claims\nthat the country itself\nis a victim of\ndiscriminatory\npolicies\n\nFrom the US perspective, according to\nits Department of Commerce, the prone\ntion against ZTE is punishment for ZTE vio-\nlating US sanctions against Iran and North\nKorea, making false statements and ob-\nstructing justice, and then after reaching a\nsettlement agreement, violating it.\n\nThe United States claims it is not resist-\ning China's rise, but rather the country’s\nunfair or illegal means to achieve it. The US\naction enumerated four such practices as\nrationale for imposing punitive tariffs, all\nrelating to technology or intellectual prop-\nerty: foreign firms in China are required to\n\nform joint ventures and transfer knowl-\nonke. as well as license technology with\nbelow-market terms and conditions, while\nthe state supports Chinese enterprises in\nacquiring foreign hi-tech assets, and sanc-\ntions commercial cyber theft.\n\nPresident Trump is wildly unpopular\namong American elites, especially among\npolicy experts, who do notneed much ofan\niticise him—note the fusillade of\nattacks on Trump’s tariffs. But these elites\nare not criticising Trump on US moves to\ncounter what they, with unusual consen-\nsus, perceive to be China's unfair policies,\nand in some cases unlawful programmes,\nto becomeaworldleaderin state-of-the-art\ntechnologies, especially AI, information\ntechnology, robotics, advanced manufact-\nuring, new energy vehicles, aviation and\nbiotechnology.\n\nChina claims that itis still a developing\ncountry, so different rules apply, a founda-\ntional principle of the World Trade Organ-\nisation. Beijing also claims that the country\nitself is a victim of discriminatory policies\nrestricting its imports of hi-tech products.\n\nOf course, China had to respond with\nappropriate actions as well as confident\nwords, imposing heavy tariffs on US\nsorghum and signalling that additional\nagricultural tariffs were at the ready, along\nwith barely veiled threats against US com-\npanies operating in China.\n\nHere's my fear. While I have argued that\nmost mainstream American experts are not\nmotivated to impede China's rise, as many\nin China believe, I can no longer make that\nargument persuasive.\n\nIn the US, there has been a dark turn\namong experts that US policy towards\nChina, calibrated over four decades to\nshepherd China's rise, has failed: China,\n\nthey have come to believe, has become a\ncompetitor and may become an adversary,\nand that US relations with China must now\nbe managed as with an emergent adver-\nsary, not as with a developing partner.\n\nIn China, nationalistic voices are on the\nrise, castigating the US for its self-serving\nmotivation to impede China's rise, and call-\ning for China to Become more self-reliant,\nmore rapidly, especially in world-class\nsemiconductors, so that the country would\nnot be vulnerable to US “blackmail”.\n\nWelcome to the unhappy world of self-\nfulfilling prophecy, where the actions of\neach side in response to a perceived threat\nfrom the other side increases the likelihood\nof that threat morphing from theoretical to\nactual.\n\nTo both sides, I offer two pieces of\nadvice. First, take a breath and a fresh look,\nbecause the road on which you are travel-\nling will not lead toa happy place.\n\nSecond, contemplate why the otherside\nis misinterpreting your actions. To my\nAmerican friends, what makes China think\nthe US is resisting its rise? To my Chinese\nfriends, what makes the US think that\nChina is a competitor and may become an\nadversary?\n\nProjecting malevolent motives and see-\ning sinister conspiracies is the easy way out.\nIt can solicit cheers and plaudits in one’s\ndomesticmedia, butitwill impede progress\nandis likely to be self-defeating.\n\nThe US and China must each figure out\nhownotto confirm the other's self-fulfilling\nprophecy.\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn isa public intellectual,\ninternational corporate strategist and\ninvestment banker, and China expert and\ncommentator. He is the author of How China's\nLeaders Think anda co-creator (with Adam Zhu)\nand host of CGTN's “Closer to China with R.L.\nKuhn” and “The Watcher” commentaries\n\nGreater effort is required to foster gender diversity\n\nKevin Sneader and Anu Madgavkar say the Asia-Pacific region needs more women leaders\n\nomen’s representation in high-\nranking positions in business\nand politics isa global issue, but\nan even more pressing one in Asia-Pacific.\nAcross the region, only one in five people in\nleading roles isa woman.\n\nThis waste of women’s talentcomes at\nan economic cost. Many economies in the\nregion are ageing and skills shortages are\nonthe rise: making more of women’s\npotential can help meet such challenges.\nBusinesses gain a great deal from\nsupporting women. McKinsey’s 2018\nreport “The Power of Parity” found that\ncompanies in the top quarter for gender\ndiversity on their executive teams are 21\npercent more likely to experience above-\naverage profitability.\n\nEven in developed economies in the\nAsia-Pacific, few women are getting to\nthe top in business—in Japan, there are no\nfemale CEOsin the top 100 public\ncompanies. In Australia and Singapore, the\nshare of women CEOs in 2016 was only 6\npercent and 5 percent respectively. The\nPhilippines, a traditionally matriarchal\nsociety whose government has been,\nproactive in tackling gender inequality,\ndoes better in senior positions overall, but\nonly3 per cent of CEOs and 15 percent of\nboard members are women.\n\nThe lower share of women in leading\npositions within companies isn'tall about\nthe glass ceiling—the point at which\nwomen’s careers appear to halt. Rather,\nwomen’s under-representation has its\nrootsas far backas the education system.\n\nIn India, only 44 per cent of students in\ntertiary education are female and many\ngraduates don’t take up employment: only\n25 per cent of entry-level positions in\nIndian companies are taken by women. In\nJapan, the share of women enrolled in\ncollege is higher, at 47 per cent, but women\nwere only 28 per cent of students attending\nthe top 10 universities.\n\nThe share of women erodes sharply\nfrom entry-level to the boardroom, and the\nbiggest “breakpoint” is motherhood. Ina\n2015 McKinsey survey, 45 per cent of Asian\nexecutives cited the “anywhere, anytime”\nperformance model as the largest barrier\ntowomen moving into senior roles. In\nJapan, a survey found that three-quarters\nof women respondents said they were not\ninterested in managerial positions, partly\nbecause promotion would mean working\neven longer hours.\n\nThe second most cited factor behind\nwomen. dropping out of workis the\n“double burden” of holding downa job\nwhile looking after the family. In China, 33\npercent of female respondents to a 2017\nsurvey said that they hada lower salary\nwhen they returned to work after having a\nbaby, and 36 percent said they had to\naccepta demotion. Sixty-three per cent\nsaid they did notwanta second child\nbecause this would hurt their career.\n\nMany women struggle to return to work\nbecause childcare options are limited or\ntoo expensive. In Australia, net childcare\ncosts (paid by two-earner families) were 20\npercent ofan average family’s income in\n\n2015, compared with the 13 per cent\naverage in OECD economies.\n\nThe attrition of women from the talent\npipeline starts even earlier\nmotherhood, as societal attitudes militate\nagainst women pursuing a career and\nprioritise looking after families. In India, 70\npercent of respondents to the 2010-2014\nWorld Values Survey agreed with the\nstatement, “When a mother works for pay,\nthe children suffer.”\n\nMore can be done to\ngive women the\nfreedom to choose a\ncareer as well as\nmotherhood\n\nThere has been some progress. The\nshare of women on company boards has\nbeen rising reflecting efforts by both\ngovernments and private-sector\norganisations. India has made it\nmandatory for companies to have at least\none female director, and the Australian\nSecurities Exchange Corporate\nGovernance Council tracks gender\ndiversity in its constituent companies.\nJapanese pharmaceutical company\nTakeda hit its target of 30 per cent ofnew\n\nmanagers being women (from only 6.2 per\ncentin 2015) through a range of initiatives\nincluding flexible working hours.\n\nHowever, there is much more that can.\nbe doneto give women the freedom to\nchoose a career as well as motherhood.\nNarrowing the leadership gender gap will\nrequire concerted action by governments\nand companies from encouraging and\nhelping girls to learn the right skills fora\nchanging labour market and mentoring\nwomen in their careers, to shiftin;\nattitudes towards women's roles through\npublic-awareness campaigns to — perhaps\nmost importantly making work flexible.\n\nMore help with childcare is urgently\nneeded. Governments can use public\nspending to expand childcare provision\nand companies can set up nurseries.\nFlexible working practices in companies\nare vital. In Australia, financial services\ncompany Suncorp enables flexible\nworking through “workat home hubs” that\ncombine home work stations and working\nspaces in regional shopping centres.\n\nSuch efforts are only likely to be\neffective with a root-and-branch shift in\nattitudes towards women’s roles in society.\nGovernments can lead from the front,\nsetting targets for women’s representation,\nin business as Japan and Singapore have\ndone, and more companies can push for\ntrue diversity within their ranks. Doing so is\nnotonlyin the interests of their bottom line\nbut the health ofthe economies in which\nthey work.\n\nKevin Sneader is chairman, Asia-Pacific, of\nMcKinsey & Company. Anu Madgavkar is a.\npartner at McKinsey Global Institute\n\nOlder people still\nhave lot to offer\nin the workplace\n\nPaul Yip says measures to ensure\nHong Kong retirees remain active\nthrough employment may help\nprevent poverty and partially offset\nthe impact of a declining birth rate\n\nkeeping people out of poverty. In Hong Kong's\n\nlatest poverty situation report, for those with a\njob, the poverty rate is only 12.3 per cent, compared to\n77.4 per cent among those not working. Among older\nadults with a job, itis 12.9 per cent, compared with 48.2\npercent among those without employment.\n\nChief Secretary Matthew Cheung Kin-chung has\nrecently raised the possibility of promoting workforce\nparticipation for those aged 50-64 and helping those\naged 65-74 re-enter the job market. Hong Kong's\nworkforce participation rate among older adults is 17.7\npercent, lower than in Japan (22.7 per\ncent), Singapore (26.8 per cent) and Seoul (31.5 per\ncent).\n\n‘The Japanese government has been very active in\npromoting workforce participation among its older\ncitizens, especially since 27 per cent of its\npopulation was aged 65 or over as of 2017. The\npopulation size has decreased, from 128 million in\n2010 to 127 million in 2015, and the United\nNations estimates that the number will continue to fall\nuntil 2061. The number of migrants moving to the\ncountry has not offset the population decrease, leaving\nno choice but to improve the labour participation and\nproductivity rate, especially among older adults and\nmarried women with children.\n\nThough Hong Kong's total fertility rate is only 1.2\nper woman —less than the 1.4 in Japan—we have\nbenefited from migration from the mainland to keep\nour population young. Our life expectancy is also very\nsimilar to Japan’s, at 81 for men and 87 for women. It is\ntime to explore how to make better use of our older\n\nThe most important thing is\nto provide an option for\nolder adults to be active in\nthe job market\n\n| ; mploymentis the most robust method for\n\nadults. We should create the right environment\n\nfor raising the retirement age and extending\nemployment beyond that age. Some issues, like\nexcessive health and medical insurance costs for the\nolder workforce, and long working hours, should be\nre-examined.\n\nThe governmentcan create a fund to protect\nagainst excessive increases in insurance costs, while\nintroducing a more flexible working arrangement for\nthe older workforce.\n\nThe most important thing is to provide an option\nfor older adults to be active in the job market, and give\nthem the choice of whether to continue in ajob. Those\nwho have had enough could perhaps take on volunteer\nwork in the community. For those who stay on with\npaid employment, more flexible time arrangements\nwould better suit their needs, while their roles could be\nredefined so as not to stand in the way of the career\nadvancement of younger workers. Some tangible\nsupport might be needed for the business sector,\nideally through a tax-deductible arrangement rather\nthan the proposed cash support.\n\nForsome work, such asin teaching and research,\nthe situation depends on individual ability. As in\noverseas countries, participants should be allowed to\nwork as long as they meet expectations. At present, a\nvigorous review process takes place to determine\nwhether to extend beyond retirement age.\n\nThe education levels of Hong Kong's older adults is\nnot high and, among those with very lowlevels, most\ncan only find workin low-skilled jobs such as cleaning\nand, security duties Nevertheless, these areas face a\nshortage oflabour and can be a good fit. In such cases,\npeople's rights and pay should be better protected, to\navoid companies exploiting this group of workers.\n\nAlso, sometimes, older adults are not driven by\nmoney when seeking work. For some, finding meaning\nin their work can be sufficient. The Japanese\nexperience shows that some older adults continue to\nwork to maintain their independence and fitness. Such\nworkers, whatever they do, display high levels of\nprofessionalism.\n\nRespecting the wishes of older adults and providing\na quality choice in terms of working would be awin-\nwin situation for the whole community.\n\nPaul Yip is chair professor (Population Health) in the\nDepartment of Social Work and Social Administration at the\nUniversity of Hong Kong\n\nFor some, finding meaning in work is important, as with\nthese women who recycle used clothes to make bags.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023689",
