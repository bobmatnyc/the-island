  "text": "For Radio Host\nOf the Counterculture,\nIt Was a Strange Trip\n\nBy COREY KILGANNON\n\nFor a half century, Bob Fass, 85,\nhas presided over the late-night\nairwaves of New York City with a\nradio show named “Radio Un-\nnameable,” which has aired since\n1963 on WBAI-FM, the listener-\nsupported haven for the radical\nleft.\n\nAs a self-described “midwife at\nthe birth of the counterculture,”\nMr. Fass, in his time behind the\nmicrophone, has borne witness to\nsome unusual episodes.\n\nThe second night his show\naired, a listener set the tone by de-\nlivering marijuana to the station.\nThere was the time, in 1966, when\nBob Dylan showed up in the studio\nand began taking callers and\ncracking jokes. In 1971, Mr. Fass\nessentially talked a caller out of\ncommitting suicide while on the\nair.\n\nBut lately, Mr. Fass’s life has be-\ngun imitating the craziness of his\nshow, ever since he and his wife,\nLynnie, attempted to move out of\ntheir Staten Island home to a new\nhouse in Danbury, Conn., setting\noff a misadventure worthy of one\nof his distressed late night callers.\n\nLast month, moments after he\nentered his new home, as the\nmovers were carrying in his be-\nlongings, Mr. Fass casually flicked\non a gas fireplace, which promptly\nmalfunctioned and set the house\non fire.\n\nIt was a two-alarm blaze that\nleft Mr. Fass, who uses a wheel-\nchair, inhaling smoke for several\nminutes until the movers rushed\nin and carried him out.\n\n“I could have been roast D.J.,”\nsaid Mr. Fass. “Have you ever\nheard the Warren Zevon song ‘I\nwas in the House When the House\nBurned Down?’”\n\nAnd so the “Unnameable” radio\nhost now faces an unknowable fu-\nture.\n\nEven in adversity, though, Mr.\nFass, whose show airs Thursday\nnights at midnight, can be counted\non for a pithy take on things. His\nimprovisational monologues and\nhis mix of guests and music\nhelped pioneer free-form radio,\nand his show was a vital forum for\nactivists, musicians, and every-\nday people to come together\naround issues including the Viet-\nnam War, drugs and social justice.\n\nAfter the fire, with nowhere else\nto stay, the Fasses returned to\ntheir empty house on Lake Ave-\nnue on Staten Island, near the\nBayonne Bridge, where they live\nwith their 10 or so adopted feral\ncats.\n\nA single couch now serves as\ntheir shared bed as they sort out\ntheir future. Most of their belong-\nings either remain in storage or\nwere damaged by the fire.\n\nThe bulk of Mr. Fass’s radio ar-\nchive was recently acquired by\nColumbia University, with pay-\nment for the acquisition going to-\nward the new house, he said.\n\nBut numerous boxes of radio re-\ncordings that Columbia had not\nacquired were damaged in the\nfire, Mr. Fass said.\n\n“There’s a lot of history in\nthere,” said Mr. Fass, who is no\nstranger to dealing with tumul-\ntuous events: His show became\nboth acommunications and cover-\nage hub for Yippie events, the 1963\nMarch on Washington, the 1968\nDemocratic National Convention\nin Chicago and the 1988 Tompkins\nSquare Park riot.\n\nHis callers have ranged from\nBlack Panthers to John Lennon to\nordinary New Yorkers. One of Mr.\nDylan’s first broadcast appear-\nances was on Radio Unnameable.\nThe Yippie movement leader Ab-\nbie Hoffman was a regular guest,\nas were Hunter S. Thompson, Al-\nlen Ginsberg and Timothy Leary.\n\nThe Danbury house fire oc-\ncurred just before the Fasses were\nset to close on both the sale of the\nStaten Island house and the pur-\nchase of the Danbury home. So\nthe fate and details of both trans-\nactions are in limbo, he said.\n\nThe Fasses said they signed an\nagreement with the developer\nbuying their house stipulating\nthat they vacate by the original\nmove-out date last month or face\ndaily monetary penalties.\n\nA lawyer for the buyer did not\nrespond to messages.\n\nEven if they had the money to\nrent a place, it might be hard to\nfind a landlord who would wel-\ncome a colony of cats, said Mr.\nFass, who had already taken two\nof the cats to the Danbury house.\nDuring the fire, one of them,\nPlutarch, escaped and remained\nmissing for several weeks, until\nMs. Fass found him.\n\nMr. Fass recently completed a\nthree-month hospital stay and is\nrecovering from heart problems.\nThe smoke inhalation from the\nfire has added a chronic cough to\nhis health concerns.\n\nMr. Fass, a native of Brooklyn\nwho lived for decades in Manhat-\ntan, moved to Staten Island 25\nyears ago, but said he had grown\nweary of the increasing truck traf-\nfic at a warehouse across the\nstreet.\n\nThe Danbury house was an af-\n\nTHE NEW YORK TIMES NEW YORK TUESDAY, APRIL 24, 2018\n\nBob and Lynnie Fass have\nbeen sleeping on the couch in\nStaten Island since a fire in\ntheir new home in Connecti-\n\ncut. Mr. Fass with Abbie Hoff-\nman, right, circa 1968.\n\nfordable option that allowed Ms.\nFass to continue to commute to\nher paralegal job in Brooklyn. Mr.\nFass had been broadcasting his\nshow remotely in recent years\nfrom a studio in his house, and\nplanned on doing so from Dan-\nbury.\n\nIn interviews, the Fasses’ bro-\nker and the lawyer handling the\npurchase of the Danbury house\nboth insisted that the Fasses will\nbe able to move into the house af-\nter a renovation covered by the\nseller’s homeowners insurance.\n\nBut the Fasses said they have\nno guarantee of this, and with\nmuch of the purchase price for the\nDanbury house in escrow, they\nare being pressured to close on\nthe property.\n\n“This type of thing is really not\nmy area, and I have no money for\na lawyer to figure it out,” said Mr\nFass, whose radio career was de-\npicted in a 2012 documentary, “Ra-\ndio Unnameable.”\n\nThe seller of the Danbury home\ndid not respond to an email, and\nher lawyer, Lawrence M. Rief-\nberg, said he could not comment\nwithout her permission.\n\nIn a poetic reversal, Mr. Fass re-\ncently called in to his own show —\nwhich is being temporarily han-\ndled by a colleague, Bill Propp —\nand. described the fire story on\nWBAI (where this reporter is an\nunpaid co-host of a weekly talk\nshow).\n\nMr. Fass said he stopped receiv-\ning a salary from WBAI in 1977\nand relies on Social Security bene-\nfits. Over the years, some of his lis-\nteners have donated to a retire-\nment fund for him.\n\nAfter the fire, some of his long-\n\nTal ie\n\ntime listeners — the Fass “cabal,”\nas he has always called them — or-\nganized pages, which have raised\nroughly $2,000.\n\nOn the radio, Mr. Fass often\nhelped raise funds for demonstra-\ntions and for legal defenses for\nsuch figures as the boxer Rubin\n“Hurricane” Carter, the activist\nWavy Gravy and Mr. Hoffman, not\nto mention institutions like the\nEast Village Other newspaper.\n\n“Bob’s been a voice for the peo-\nple for so long, and so many listen-\ners have called in to his show in\ntheir time of need,” said Jessica\nWolfson, who with Paul Lovelace,\n\nROBERT ALTMAN/MICHAEL OCHS ARCHIVES, VIA GETTY IMAGES\n\nproduced and directed the “Radio\nUnnameable” documentary. “And\nnow he has a chance to move to a\ncomfortable living situation and\nthe whole thing literally goes up in\nflames.”\n\nResting on his couch in the liv-\ning room, next to his walker and\nhis oxygen tanks, Mr. Fass dis-\nposed of a telemarketer by feign-\ning a heart attack while on the\nphone. Then he sighed.\n\n“[’m just overwhelmed by ev-\nerything that’s happening,” he\nsaid. “It might sound amusing, but\nnot when it’s happening in your\nown life.”\n\nThe Cold-Case Specialist Who Wants to Put Robert\n\nBy CHARLES V. BAGLI\n\nLOS ANGELES — When\nRobert A. Durst was asked why he\nhad talked to the makers of “The\nJinx” — the 2015 HBO documenta-\nry about the suspicions that had\ndogged him for years over the un-\ntimely deaths of his first wife, a\nclose confidante and a cantanker-\nous neighbor in Texas — he said\nhe had thought it was low risk.\n\nIt was unlikely, he said, that any\nprosecutor would “commence a\nmajor, budget-busting investiga-\ntion” for a couple of cold cases.\n\nBut shortly before the last\nepisode was broadcast, John\nLewin, a deputy district attorney\nin Los Angeles, proved Mr. Durst\nwrong. Mr. Lewin, who has a long\nrecord of winning guilty verdicts\nin cold murder cases, had him ar-\nrested in New Orleans.\n\nMr. Lewin would eventually\ncharge Mr. Durst with the execu-\ntion-style murder in Los Angeles\nin 2000 of his confidante, Susan\nBerman. Preliminary hearings in\nthe case were held in a courtroom\nhere last week.\n\nThe prosecution contends that\nMr. Durst, the alienated scion of a\nNew York real estate family, killed\nMs. Berman with a gunshot to the\nback of the head to prevent her\nfrom revealing her role in helping\nhim cover up the murder of his\nfirst wife, Kathie Durst, to investi-\ngators who had reopened that\ncase.\n\nIn a sense, Mr. Lewin must\nprove two cold cases, not just one.\n“It is important to understand\nthat all of the defendant’s subse-\nquent criminal conduct can be\ntraced back to his original killing\nof his wife Kathie decades earlier,\nand his subsequent efforts to\navoid criminal culpability for her\ndeath,” he said in court papers.\n\nMr. Lewin, who declined to be\ninterviewed for this story, has\ntalked to virtually every witness\nin the case, which covers 40 years\nand has a cast of dozens. During\ncourt hearings over the past year,\nhe has displayed an encyclopedic\nknowledge of Mr. Durst, his his-\ntory, his friends and his alleged\nvictims.\n\nMr. Lewin has conducted pun-\nishing examinations of Mr. Durst’s\nfriends and even of the now-re-\ntired detective who first looked\ninto the disappearance of Ms.\nDurst.\n\nJABIN BOTSFORD/LOS ANGELES TIMES:\nJohn Lewin, a prosecutor in Los Angeles, has an encyclopedic\nknowledge of Robert Durst and a reputation as a “pit bull.”\n\n“He’s a pit bull” said Kathie\nDurst’s brother, Jim McCormack.\n\nThere is little doubt by either\nside that the hearings, which ad-\njourned after four days of testi-\nmony and argument, will con-\nclude in October with Judge Mark\nWindham binding Mr. Durst over\nfor trial, starting probably early\nnext year.\n\nBut that does not mean that Mr.\nLewin has a clear path to another\nguilty verdict. Mr. Lewin and his\ncolleagues will still have to con-\ntend with hazy, in some cases 40-\nyear-old memories; the lack of the\nweapon in Ms. Berman’s shoot-\ning; and the absence of a body or\neven a crime scene in the disap-\npearance and presumed death of\nMs. Durst, for which no one has\never been charged.\n\nMr. Durst, 75, frail and worth\n$100 million, has said repeatedly\nthat he did not kill his first wife,\nnor does he know who killed Ms.\nBerman. And despite the cer-\ntainty of a trial, Dick DeGuerin,\nthe Texas lawyer who leads Mr.\nDurst’s defense team, insists that\nthe prosecution has still not prov-\nen that Mr. Durst killed either\nwoman.\n\nAs for the hard-charging pros-\necutor with whom he has repeat-\nedly clashed, “He’s a bully, but\nthat’s not unusual for prosecu-\ntors,’ Mr. DeGuerin said of Mr.\nLewin. “And he’s not used to peo-\nple standing up to him.”\n\nBoth sides have already in-\nvested an enormous amount of\ntime and money in the case. Mr.\n\nDurst’s defense is expected to cost\nwell in excess of $10 million, ac-\ncording to two people briefed on\nthe matter who requested ano-\nnymity because they were not au-\nthorized to discuss it publicly.\n\nMr. Lewin, 54, looks like an out-\nof-shape football lineman with a\nmodified crew cut. He tells jokes\nat his own expense one minute\nand rails at the defense the next.\nBut he is always about the case.\n\n“T’m like the sloth,” he told Los\nAngeles Magazine, referring to\nthe mammal that spend most of its\ntime hanging upside down in\ntrees. “I have this one skill.”\n\nSince he won his first cold case\nin 2002, Mr. Lewin has stacked up\n16 guilty verdicts or pleas, the\nmagazine said.\n\nHis first cold case resurfaced\nthis year when a state panel ruled\nthat William Bradford, whom Mr.\nLewin successfully tried for the\nmurder of his wife after the case\nlay dormant for 12 years, and who\nis now 84, deserved parole,a move\nthat Mr. Lewin vehemently op-\nposed.\n\nMr. Lewin’s decision to pick up\nthe Berman case was propelled, in\npart, by the producers of “The\nJinx,” Andrew Jarecki and Marc\nSmerling, who brought the au-\nthorities what they believed was\nnew evidence about Ms. Berman’s\nmurder and the disappearance of\nMs. Durst.\n\nOn Dec. 24, 2000, the police\nfound the body of Ms. Berman, a\nsometime screenwriter, in her\nBenedict Canyon home in Los An-\n\ngeles, shot in the back of the head.\nSomeone had sent a note to the\nBeverly Hills Police Department\nalerting them toa “cadaver” at the\naddress.\n\nSuspicion quickly passed from\nMs. Berman’s landlady to her\nmanager before landing on Mr\nDurst. But once again, little came\nof it.\n\nIn interviews with “The Jinx”\nproducers, Mr. Durst admitted\nthat he had lied to police in 1982\nabout his whereabouts at the time\nhis wife disappeared and de-\nscribed how his marriage had be-\ncome a series of “half arguments,\nfighting, slapping, pushing,\nwrestling.”\n\nIn a scene depicted in “The\nJinx,’ Mr. Durst could not distin-\nguish between the handwriting on\nthe envelope of the “cadaver”\nnote, which misspelled Beverly\nHills as “Beverley,” and a note he\nhad sent to Ms. Berman with the\nsame misspelling.\n\nThe documentary ended fa-\nmously with Mr. Durst muttering\noff camera, “What the hell did I\ndo? Killed them all of course.”\n\nMr. DeGuerin has dismissed the\ndocumentary as a Hollywood con-\ncoction.\n\nAfter having Mr. Durst arrested\non a murder warrant and gun\ncharges, Mr. Lewin hopped a\nplane to New Orleans and man-\naged to interview him for three\nhours before he was arraigned. In\nthe interview, Mr. Lewin compli-\nmented and cajoled Mr. Durst,\nsuggesting he would never be a\nfree man, although he might be\nable to negotiate a plea.\n\nThe defense challenged the in-\nterrogation as “improper and de-\nceptive.” Mr. Lewin responded an-\ngrily in a brief to what he de-\nscribed as “baseless allegations,”\nalong with a video and transcript\nof the entire encounter.\n\nWith no witnesses and no mur-\nder weapon, Mr. Lewin has been\nbuilding a case out of tiny puzzle\npieces. He may have set a record\nfor the use of what are known as\nconditional hearings, in which a\nprosecutor can question wit-\nnesses 65 or older who could die or\nbecome ill before trial — he\nbrought 20 witnesses to the stand\nfor them. A judge must determine\nwhether any of the testimony is\nadmissible at trial.\n\nIn response to a 12-page motion\nfrom the defense to exclude any\n\nDurst Away\n\nstatements Ms. Berman allegedly\nmade to her friends as hearsay,\nMr. Lewin responded in March\nwith what has become known as\n“Big Boy”: a 77-page brief accom-\npanied by 316 pages of exhibits.\n\nAt times, the space between the\ndefense and prosecution tables\nhas crackled. Mr. Lewin once\nmade a remark about “these law-\nyers being paid millions of dol-\nlars.” It was not long before Mr.\nDeGuerin bounced back with a\ncrack about Mr. Lewin driving a\nPorsche.\n\nMr. Lewin’s full-court press has\noccasionally rankled Judge Wind-\nham, particularly when he contin-\nues to argue a motion after the\njudge has ruled in his favor.\n“Youre interrupting my think-\ning,” the normally Zen-like judge\nsaid at one point last Thursday.\n“Please be quiet.”\n\nThe prosecution scored two vic-\ntories last week when Judge\nWindham ruled that he would ac-\ncept testimony from 13 friends\nwho say Ms. Berman confided to\nthem that she assisted Mr. Durst\nin the cover-up and had been ex-\npecting him to visit her around the\ntime of her murder. The judge also\naccepted testimony and records\nconcerning incidents of domestic\nviolence in the Durst marriage,\npending challenges by the de-\nfense.\n\nKaren Minutello, the former\nmanager of the Manhattan build-\ning where the Dursts had an\napartment in 1982, testified dur-\ning last week’s hearing that Ms.\nDurst had called her shortly be-\nfore her disappearance, saying\nthat she was looking for another\napartment in the building because\n“she needed to get away” from her\nhusband.\n\nA week after Ms. Durst disap-\npeared, Ms. Minutello said, she\nsaw the porters pulling her note-\nbooks, textbooks, makeup and\nclothing from a jammed trash\ncompactor in the basement of the\nbuilding. Ms. Minutello deter-\nmined that it had all been shoved\ndown the chute from the Dursts’\n15th-floor apartment.\n\n“Who does that?” Ms.\nMinutello said. “Their loved one\nmissing and you throw out their\nstuff”\n\nShe said she expected to be\nquestioned by the police. She “al-\nways expected them to” call, she\nwent on, “and they never did.”\n\nHOUSE_\n\nN A21\n\nCorrections\n\nINTERNATIONAL\n\nAn article on Monday about the\nnumber of women and Afro-Cu-\nbans chosen to serve under Cuba’s\nnew president referred incor-\nrectly to research about the racial\nbalance among college students in\nCuba and the United States in the\n1980s. A study by Alejandro de la\nFuente found that the proportion,\nnot the number, of black Cubans\nwith degrees compared with white\nCubans was close, and that the\nproportion, not the number, of\nwhite college degree holders in\nthe United States was twice that of\nAfrican-Americans. The study\nalso referred to graduation rates,\nnot attendance.\n\nAnarticle on Monday about pro-\ntests against social security\nchanges in Nicaragua misstated\nthe legal changes that allowed\nDaniel Ortega to win a presiden-\ntial election in 2007. He was al-\nlowed to win by a plurality, not a\nsimple majority.\n\nAn article on Sunday about the\nreception of Miguel Diaz-Canel\nBermidez, Cuba’s new president,\ndescribed incorrectly adjust-\nments to immigration policy un-\nder the Obama administration.\nPresident Barack Obama ended\n“wet foot dry foot,” a rule that al-\nlowed Cubans who arrived with-\nout visas to remain in the United\nStates. He did not end the Cuban\nadjustment act.\n\nAnarticle on Saturday about the\nactress Natalie Portman’s deci-\nsion to skip the Genesis Prize cer-\nemony in Jerusalem referred in-\ncorrectly to Scarlett Johansson’s\ndeparture from the charity Oxfam.\nShe resigned as a spokeswoman;\nshe was not dropped.\n\nBecause of an editing error, an\narticle on Saturday about an auc-\ntion to sell historical objects in\nHeathrow Airport misstated how\nmany passengers Heathrow’s Ter-\nminal 1 could accommodate when\nit was dedicated in 1969. It was\nnine million passengers a year, not\naday.\n\nBUSINESS DAY\n\nAn article on Sunday about\nCampbell Brown’s role as Face-\nbook’s head of news partnerships\nerroneously included a reference\nto Palestinian actions as an exam-\nple of the sort of far-right conspir-\nacy stories that have plagued\nFacebook. In fact, Palestinian offi-\ncials have acknowledged provid-\ning payments to the families of\nPalestinians killed while carrying\nout attacks on Israelis or con-\nvicted of terrorist acts and impris-\noned in Israel; that is not a con-\nspiracy theory.\n\nAn article on Saturday about\nPresident Trump’s criticism of\nOPEC and rising oil prices mis-\nstated, in one reference, a recent\nincrease in gasoline prices. They\nhave risen 33 cents in the last year,\nnot the last month.\n\nAn article on Wednesday about\nbudget airlines reinvigorating\nsmaller airports on the outskirts\nof major cities misstated the dis-\ntance between Seattle Tacoma In-\nternational Airport and Paine\nField. They are about 37 miles\napart, not 12.\n\nSPORTS\n\nAn article on Friday about the\nhesitance of the International As-\nsociation of Athletics Federations\nto allow Russian athletes to com-\npete in major track and field\nevents misstated Sebastian Coe’s\ntitle within the organization dur-\ning an extortion scheme. He was\nvice president, not senior vice\npresident.\n\nTHE ARTS\n\nA picture caption with an article\non Saturday about the Actors’ Eq-\nuity Association’s decision to re-\ntire the term “Gypsy Robe”\nmisidentified the “Cats” cast\nmember wearing the garment. He\nis Jeremy Davis, not Jeremy Ford.\n\nAn opera review on Monday\nabout “The Metromaniacs” by Da-\nvid Ives, using information from a\npublicist, misstated the number of\nFrench plays from the 17th and\n18th centuries that David Ives has\ntranslated. It is four, not three. The\nreview also misstated the number\nof plays that were collected for “All\nin the Timing.” It is six, not three.\n\nOBITUARIES\n\nAnobituary on Friday about the\nrecord producer and songwriter\nRonald Dunbar omitted the name\nof one of his survivors. In addition\nto those named, he is survived by\na daughter, Ginger Atherton.\n\nAn obituary on April 15 about\nthe actor Tim O’Connor misidenti-\nfied the county in New Jersey\nwhere Glen Wild Lake, the site of\nan island where he and his wife\nlived for many years, is located.
