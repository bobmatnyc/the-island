  "text": "encounter, but if the encounter has been particularly difficult, it's doubly important. I\nhave personally had good experiences leaving Super Intense Conversations like the one I\ndescribe above until post-aftercare, when all partners have calmed down and dealt with\nany immediate emotional responses.\n\nI'm writing vaguely, so here are some concrete suggestions for things to say during the\nconversation after a difficult BDSM encounter:\n\n* \"I'm sorry.”\n\n* \"T still like you and think you're a good person.”\n\n* \"Do you want to talk about this now? If not now, then let's set a concrete time for later.\"\n* \"I'm feeling really vulnerable and confused right now.\"\n\n* \"Why do you think that happened? How were you reading me, and what were you\nthinking as you responded to me?”\n\n* \"How do we feel about this now that we've discussed it, and how can we keep it from\nhappening again?\"\n\n* \"What have we learned about landmines? Are there any particular words or actions that\nare definitely off-limits from now on?\"\n\nI have one final super important caveat to add here: Not all \"screwups\" are actually\nscrewups. Some are just plain abuse. A human-shaped predator will use words like\n\"miscommunication\" and \"mistake\" to cover up what they do. This post is focused on\nhonest errors, but there are dishonest and evil people out there. In particular, if a person\n\"keeps screwing up\"... that's a terribly bad sign. It is not an inherent part of BDSM to\nfeel roiled up and confused and alienated after a BDSM encounter; most BDSMers\nfeel more intimate and connected after successful encounters.\n\nUPDATE, March 2012: I just found some notes that I took during a workshop about\nBDSM edgeplay that was run by Mollena Williams in late December. (Edgeplay is a term\nfor BDSM activities that feel especially intense for the participants.) Mollena suggests\nsome questions to ask beforehand:\n\n* Have I seen my partner do S&M before? What did they say or do that made me feel\ngood and comfortable? What did they say that made me have an intense reaction? -- Pass\nthis information on to the partner ahead of time.\n\n* What does my gut feeling say about this person? -- /fyou have a bad gut feeling about\na person, listen to it! Especially for edgeplay.\n\nMollena also suggested that when BDSMers play at the edge, they \"make a contingency\nplan” ahead of time... not just for the participants, but for everyone watching, since such\nactivities often take place at dungeons. She noted that such a \"contingency plan\" might\ncontain:\n\n* Honesty and thoroughness, of course\n\n* Each partner giving each other explicit permission to safeword\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018655",
