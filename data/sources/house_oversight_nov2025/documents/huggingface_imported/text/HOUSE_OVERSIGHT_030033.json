  "text": "4\n\nabout how to deal with the growing protests has led to increasingly\nviolent confrontations inside the regime between would-be reformers\nand hard-liners. The outcome of this internal contest remains\nuncertain.\n\nWhat is certain, however, is that what happens in Syria is of great\nconcern to the whole region. Together with its two principal allies,\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran and the Lebanese Shiite resistance\nmovement Hezbollah, Syria is viewed with great hostility by Israel\nand with wary suspicion by the United States. The Tehran-Damascus-\nHezbollah axis -- of which Syria is the linchpin -- has long been seen\nby many leaders in the region as the lone bulwark against Israeli and\nAmerican hegemony. With backing from Washington, Israel has\nsought to smash Hezbollah (notably through its 2006 invasion of\nLebanon) and detach Syria from Iran, a country Israel views as its\nmost dangerous regional rival. Neither objective has so far been\nrealized. But now that Syria has been weakened by internal problems,\nthe viability of the entire axis is in danger -- which could encourage\ndangerous risk-taking behavior by its allies as they seek to counter\nperceived gains by the United States and Israel.\n\nIf the Syrian regime were to be severely weakened by popular dissent,\nif only for a short while, Iran's influence in Arab affairs would almost\ncertainly be reduced -- in both Lebanon and the Palestinian\nterritories. In Lebanon, it would appear that Hezbollah has already\nbeen thrown on the defensive. Although it remains the most powerful\nsingle movement, both politically and on account of its armed militia,\nits local enemies sense a turning of the tide in their favor. This might\nexplain a violent speech delivered earlier this month by the Sunni\nMuslim leader and former prime minister Saad Hariri, in which he\nblatantly played the sectarian card.\n\nCheered by his jubilant supporters, he charged that Hezbollah's\nweapons were not so much a threat to Israel as to Lebanon's own\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030033",
