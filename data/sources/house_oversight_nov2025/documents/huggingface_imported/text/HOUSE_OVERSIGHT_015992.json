  "text": "302 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\n= 3 —————————_\n\nEureka\n\nafter this you get that Eureka moment - illumination or insight where\nthe creative idea bursts forth into your conscious awareness. The idea\nmust finally be verified. Many of our ideas will turn out to be mistakes,\nbut that’s part of creativity. In the nearly hundred years of investigation\nsince Wallas proposed this theorem, we have not moved much further\nforward in understanding creativity.\n\nAlan Turing described his thoughts on the science behind creativity\nin a short piece he wrote about decision making:\n\n“When making a decision of minor importance, I have always\nfound it advantageous to consider all the pros and cons. In vital\nmatters, however, such as the choice of a mate or a profession, the\ndecision should come from the unconscious, from somewhere\nwithin ourselves. In the important decisions of personal life, we\nshould be governed, I think, by the deep inner needs of our nature.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015992",
