Juco Decl. 114; Bersch v.\nDrexel Firestone, Inc., 519 F.2d 974, 998\n(2d Cir.1975) (finding Canadian securities\nbroker not “doing business” in New York\nwhen it arranges for its Canadian custom-\ners to buy and sell U.S. securities through\nU.S. broker). In 2002, less than 2% of the\nsecurities NCB traded for its own account\nwere issued by U.S. entities. Juco Decl.\n915; Schenker, 2002 WL 1560788, at *3-5\n(finding that a single bank account in the\nUnited States, constituting small fraction\nof defendant’s total assets, is insufficient to\nform the basis for personal jurisdiction).\n\n[65] Taken individually, NCB’s con-\ntacts with the United States would not\nsatisfy due process requirements. Howev-\ner, when they are examined as a whole—\nthe presence of a branch office until 1992,\na subsidiary until 2001, taking advantage\nof the privilege of its presence in New\nYork by instigating a lawsuit in this forum,\nadvertisements in U.S. publications—the\nCourt finds that they may, with the help of\nlimited jurisdictional discovery, comport\nwith due process. NCB’s motion to dis-\nmiss is therefore denied without prejudice.\n\n7. Abdulrahman bin Mahfouz\n\nAbdulrahman bin Mahfouz is a Defen-\ndant in the Burnett action. He is the son\nof Defendant Khalid bin Mahfouz and a\ndirector of the Defendant charity Blessed\nRelief Society, also known as Muwaffaq.\nBurnett Complaint 11331; 445. Blessed\n\n37. The Burnett Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed\ntheir claims against Nimir LLC. See Mem. in\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nRelief is a branch of the Human Concern\nInternational Society, which Osama bin\nLaden identified as a supporter in 1995.\nId. 1333. He is a shareholder and the\nCEO of former Defendant Nimir, LLC,\nalso known as Nimir Petroleum Ltd. Jd.\n1443.\" Finally, Plaintiffs claim that Mr.\nbin Mahfouz was a member of the board\nand Vice Chairman of the Executive Man-\nagement Committee of Defendant National\nCommercial Bank. Jd. 1 445.\n\nPlaintiffs base their personal jurisdiction\narguments on their claim that Mr. bin\nMahfouz was a participant in the conspira-\ncy of terror that purposefully directed its\nconduct at the United States and included\nthe September 11 hijackers. Plaintiffs\nalso claim that he has business interests in\nthe United States. Specifically he is a\nshareholder in U.S.-based companies, and\nhis company, Al Murjan, allegedly has\ndealings with the American phone compa-\nny Hughes Technologies, Inc.\n\nMr. bin Mahfouz disputes the manner in\nwhich he was served. His name appeared\nin Plaintiffs’ notice by publication in The\nInternational Herald, which only has cir-\nculation of 199 in the entire Kingdom of\nSaudi Arabia, and Al Quds al-Arabia,\nwhich is banned in the Kingdom. He sub-\nmits that he has no personal contacts with\nthe United States and there is no basis for\nexercising personal jurisdiction over him.\n\n[66] The Burnett complaint does not\ncontain any specific actions by Mr. bin\nMahfouz from which the Court could infer\nthat he purposefully directed his activities\nat the United States. His affiliations with\nentities that are alleged to have U.S. con-\ntacts will not sustain jurisdiction. Family\nInternet, 1999 WL 796177, at *4.
