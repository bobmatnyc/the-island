Subject: inquiry re: Giuffre v Maxwell settlement

Good afternoon, Marty:

This is James Hill at ABC News.

Do you have any statement you wish to share on behalf of Mr. Epstein regarding the settlement reached in
the defamation suit filed by Virginia Giuffre v. Ghislaine Maxwell?

| know from the court filings and hearing transcripts, that Mr. Epstein was deposed in this action, but was not
expected to be called as a live trial witness.

According to the transcripts - it was represented by plaintiff’s counsel during pre-trial hearings, that Mr.
Epstein invoked his 5“ amendment rights and declined to answer substantive questions during the
deposition. It also appears that Judge Sweet had not yet made a final determination as to whether Mr.
Epstein’s depo, or selected portions thereof, would be admitted at trial (which is obviously a moot point,
now).

If you believe any of that to be in error, and/or if you wish to provide a statement about the settlement or in
response to Giuffre’s allegations about your client, please give me a call or reply to this email.

If you have no comment, I’d appreciate you letting me know that.
