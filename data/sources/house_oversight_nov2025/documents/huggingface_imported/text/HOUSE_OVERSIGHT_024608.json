  "text": "17\n\nand regain its full rights.\" Egypt's new government has made tentative\nsteps in that direction: Members of the Supreme Council of the\nArmed Forces, accompanied by the deputy interior minister and\nmembers of the military intelligence, held a meeting on Aug. 20 in\nthe el-Arish military club, in a conference hall with Bedouin sheikhs\nrepresenting each tribe in Sinai. At the meeting speakers from both\nsides expressed their willingness to cooperate in bringing the security\nsituation back to normal and to bury the hatchet \"for love of Sinai.\"\nThe government officials announced their concessions, including\npromises to soon issue a new law regarding land ownership in the\nregion and to revisit the files of those Bedouins sentenced in absentia;\nthe Bedouins dutifully clapped at the news. Several Bedouin sheikhs\nsubsequently took to the podium and announced their intentions to\nassist in securing the region.\n\nThe government's planned reforms are a good start, but after years of\nneglect, it's going to take more than promises to win over the\nBedouins. If Egypt is truly concerned about securing Sinai, it must\nquickly turn its words into actions.\n\nMohamed Fadel Fahmy is the author of Baghdad Bound and works\nas a freelance news producer/journalist for CNN in Cairo.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024608",
