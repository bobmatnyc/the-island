And thus I lived,\nwaiting and watching to see if I was turning into someone that I needed to shoot.\n\nFortunately, Wiseman found partners who were open to exploring S&M with him, and\nwent on to write extensively about safety and consent and communication within S&M.\nTrying to communicate in an egalitarian way is arguably the most complicated part of\nany S&M encounter; as Scootah told me, \"There are certainly elements that could\npotentially unbalance a relationship in my favor. I'm a big reasonably strong guy. I do\nusually make more money than my partners. I also have this whole sense of position in\nthe local S&M community. I mostly just try to be aware of those things. I try to be very\ncareful about not taking advantage of that and negotiate clearly and not pressure people.”\n\nThere are lots of ways to do clear negotiation, including asking open-ended questions\nbefore any S&M actually happens: \"What are you interested in? Could you go into that\nmore?\" There's also a huge emphasis on talking through the S&M encounter afterwards,\nas part of the post-S&M processing we call aftercare. As another gent who goes by Noir\nsaid: \"It really helped me to have a few great, feminist S&M partners. Having that echo\nof ‘it's OK, I want this,' as well as the honest feedback when I do wrong really helped\nshape how I experience S&M, and with who. It's meant I learned how better to read and\ngrasp the people in my, er, grasp.”\n\nNoir also noted, \"I strive to use dominance and submission as a tool for helping my\npartners become stronger, in ways that also feed my S&M preferences. For example, I\ntend to form long-term interests with women who want a 'safe space’ to extend and\nexplore their ability to be sluts, with all that can imply. But in the process, we also\nexplore how becoming more confident in one's sexuality also can reflect into everyday\nlife. Also, just coming to spaces in the S&M community can be a goldmine of\ninformation. All a dominant man has to do is read, listen, open up and understand. One\nthing I learned was that my fears about reinforcing our messed-up society were shared by\nwomen into kink... but also that my ways of approaching the topic, as 'oh, we're so\ncontrolled by society!' were themselves pushing too much agency out of women's\nchoices. There's a balance there that we guys who identify as both feminist and kinky\nhave to respect, and that can come from listening to feminist women struggle with these\nissues, themselves.\"\n\nThe alternative sexuality advocate Pepper Mint (who has his own blog) told me that in\nterms of putting gender on his experiences, \"I am a bit genderqueer, and I personally\nexperience dominance with either a feminine or masculine vibe from moment to moment.\nCertain activities -- like punching -- feel masculine, while others -- like whipping --\nfeminine in the moment. Also, I switch, meaning that I don't always take the dominant\nrole. Strangely, my most clearly masculine S&M activity is masochism. I always feel\nvery manly while taking pain. I don't think I can clearly explain why these things have\nattached to gender in my head, though presumably I'm being affected by cultural tropes to\nsome extent.”\n\nThe consensus in general was that dominance, whether masculine or feminine, is\nsomething that happens in an encounter... not outside it. As Pepper put it, \"New guys\noften want to play hard or do hardcore things, and will often boast and swagger. Kinky\nwomen almost always recognize this as dangerous bullshit.
