  "text": "just oblivious to what others are thinking: a willful and\nin a sense fatal tone deafness.\n\nPress accounts recycle the mysterious billionaire\nmythology—a man of vast and unsourced riches living\nin a parallel universe of absolute entitlement—with brief\nglimpses of him stepping out of the house (the same\nphotos endlessly republished), and the assumption of\ndepravity inside.\n\nIn fact, the life in the house, without wife or\nchildren or conventional domestic demeanor, rather\nconforms to the scripted fantasies: somewhere between\nDaddy Warbucks and Eyes Wide Shut. There is indeed a\ngroup of young women—in their twenties and thirties—\nwho act as Epstein’s support staff and companions.\nSome have worked for him for many years, marrying,\nhaving children, and continuing as part of his business\nand household infrastructure. One woman, on an\nafternoon when I was there, had just returned from an\naround-the-world honeymoon that Epstein had arranged\nfor her. Some are, or have been, his romantic interests.\nHis present girlfriend, whom he met four years ago at a\ndinner party in New York, has just graduated dental\nschool. One former girlfriend, Eva Andersson Dubin, a\nSwedish model and Miss Universe finalist whom\nEpstein has known for more than thirty years, became a\ndoctor—Epstein sent her to medical school—and\nmarried hedge funder Glen Dubin. Together they\nfinance the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai\nHospital.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024234",
