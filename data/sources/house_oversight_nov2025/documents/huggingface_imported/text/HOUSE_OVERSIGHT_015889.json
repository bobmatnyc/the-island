  "text": "Known Unknowns 199\n\nNumbers\n\nIt was not until the late 18\" century that numbers were properly codified.\nThe mathematician Giuseppe Peano gave us the rules, so they are called\nPeano axioms. Here are his ‘axioms’ in natural language.\n\nPeano Axioms\n\n1. The first number is named zero.\n\n2. Every number hasa next number (called its successor). Example:\nthe next number after one is two.\n\n3. Numbers are singular. Every number with the same name is the\nsame thing.\n\n4. If something is true of a number, it should be true of the next\nnumber (the successor number).\n\nFrom this we can prove some very simple things.\n\n1+1=2. Because the next number after 1 is 2 and ‘+1’ means take\nthe successor. (You can see J cheated here a little and did not take 100\npages for the proof.)\n\nBack to my poor mother: “Why is the lowest number zero,\nMummy?” “Because I say so!” Or, at least “...because Mr. Peano said\nso.” That’s what an axiom is.\n\n“OK, but why is 3 greater than 2””\n\n“Because I said that each number has a thing that comes after it.\n\n“But, why can’t 3 come after zero!”\n\n“Tt can!”\n\n“But then, if 3 is the thing after zero, I could count 0, 3, 2, 4...”\n\n“Yes, if you want to...”\n\n“Tm sort of lost. Now, you are saying that 3 doesn't really ‘mea’\nanything. It just comes after 0”\n\n“Yes. You can make up any symbols you like. You just have to\nremember what you said and be consistent.”\n\nThe dialogue shows the importance of definition in mathematics.\nI could define my counting numbers as 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 or as 0, 2, p, 6, ¢, OF\n= th, {k, 2 or to be really annoying and confusing 0, 3, 1, 2, 4; they\nare only arbitrary symbols. It helps us to learn the numbers because 1\nis a single line, 2 is two lines joined, three is basically three lines looped\ntogether, and four is four lines, but we could have used any symbols\nwe cared for. It is the rules for manipulating these symbols that are the\nimportant part and give mathematics its meaning.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015889",
