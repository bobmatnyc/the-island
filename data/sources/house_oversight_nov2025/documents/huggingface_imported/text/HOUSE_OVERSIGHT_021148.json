Sometimes he would hurt me and tell me\nto try and enjoy it then do it over and over again until I gave him exactly\nwhat he wanted, I always resisted until I could no more, he was too\noverpowering and relentless at getting the results he wanted. At other\ntimes he could be so gentle and caress my skin, worshiping every inch of\nmy body, all relying upon on what mood he was in. Often though he liked\nto play the teacher role and instruct me on every motion and explain what\nwould happen when I did those certain things to him. No matter what he\ndid to me I was only disgusted with myself more and more. | still shudder\nat the thought of how he used my body.\n\nI turned fourteen in August that same year and was spending my\nbirthday loaded on a concoction of pharmaceuticals and alcohol, being\ngenerously supplied by the very man who swore his devotion to caring\nfor my every need. I didn’t even know myself any longer, completely\nshying away from the girl I had grown up to be until to this point. The\napartment was empty except for me, for the time being, and that was\nGod’s own little present for me...some solitude for once I thought.\nPouring myself another drink I opened the sliding glass doors to the NN\nbalcony and walked to the edge. Looking down from the many stories \\\nwhere Ron’s apartment was, 1 wished myself a happy birthday out loud \\\nand wondered if my family even remembered the day’s occurrence.\n\nDwelling in my sadness for the fourteen years of suffering and\nloneliness I had already endured, the tears swelled up in my eyes,\ntrickling downwards making my eyeliner inevitably leak down my\ncheeks. Inside I felt so trapped and began to entertain the thought of\njumping over the edge, it all seemed much easier, and the simple\nblackness that death had to offer rather than the tangled mess I was so\ntired of fighting to get out of seemed a much easier approach. Detached\nfrom wanting to feel anything, I became so numb towards my life’s own\ntragedies. | couldn’t live like this any longer. I lifted my bare legs over\nthe edge of the railing and sat looking at the ground beneath me so close\nto even just slipping off the edge to my very death. I couldn’t think of any\nreason not to fall. I thought I had made too many bad decisions to keep\ngoing on but some force of a higher nature had other things in store for\nme.\n\nThe sliding door slammed open with a burst of speed and Ron scooped\nme up in his big arms and brought me inside to our bedroom. Laying me\ndown and seeing the look of despair in my eyes from my tear stained face\nhe went into the bathroom cupboard and returned with three pink pills.\nForcing me to swallow them using the angered tone of his voice he\nthought he was turning my sorrows into a distant dream as ! passed out in\n\n©] Copyright Protected Material .\nCONIIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004140\n\nhis tight clutches, crying myself all the way to sleep. He didn’t even ask\nme what was wrong, probably because he knew already.\n\nSoon enough the crumbling of his evil empire in the underworld of\nselling sex for his own advantage began with a single crack in his perfect\nscheme, and proudly it all started with me. Ron got a scare one-day and\nrampaged through his apartment telling us girls to only pack our\nimportant belongings and some clothes as we all had to leave right away.\nI didn’t have much belonging to me so I basically sat there watching\neveryone rush around frantically and was curious what could’ve gotten a\nman like Ron so scarred. Once we were packed up and in the limo he was\ntrying to calm the frantic girls down after all the panic that spread through\nthe apartment like wildfire, | was the only one sitting there half amused at\nthe entire situation.\n\nHe began by assuring us that everything was going to be fine. Calmly\nhe continued to tell all of us packed in tightly, even for a limo, that we\nwere all taking a long trip to Florida’s countryside because someone has\nreported an anonymous tip to the missing persons unit at the local police\nstation identifying a very young girl as a possible victim of abuse living\nat his apartment. Ron knew what a landmine of trouble he had brought\nupon himself making an exhibition out of me on the streets of Miami, I\ndidn’t pull off the older look like the other girls, | actually looked\nyounger than my age with my blue eyes and freckles always giving the\nimpression of my youthful innocence.\n\nNow he just had to do whatever it took to ensure he stayed as far away\nfrom the authorities as possible. Arriving at a ranch in central Florida\nmany hours later and I assumed it belonged to Ron knowing never to ask\nhim things like that. | knew my purpose and it wasn’t prying into his\npersonal life outside of the bedroom. There was a main house, a few\ncottages, some staff quarters and paddocks where the horses were kept. |\nwas in heaven...] thought at first. Finally, something | could really enjoy.\nRiding was my passion, basically growing up on the backs of horses since\nI was just able to walk.\n\nNot surprisingly I began to despise Ron and all of the girls for the\ngross exploits they made me do with them. Beginning to isolate myself\nfrom everyone I’d rather spend my time sitting under a tree watching the\nhorses graze, writing in my journal or painting but mostly avoiding\neveryone possible unless Ron required me elsewhere. Nighttime was\nalways a reoccurring nightmare for me. Relived over and over again in\nmany various ways. Ron would always start by making me some drinks\nand offering an assortment of pills before indulging himself by\ngrotesquely putting his genitals in my mouth and tell me how to give him\nwhat he would call a “first-class blow-job”, and | was being judged every\nminute of it.
