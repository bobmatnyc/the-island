Importance: — High

no evidence you got the latest so i have sent you just the key message itself—rather long so 1 have put in bold
the only references to Enhanced Learning Foundation—references had to do with paying Amy Jacobson 30
grand for a year of work on Honour killings—my own expenses covered by myself

of course i know little or nothing about stocks but i do feel like Trump is nothing but bad news for them, which

frightens me, given that he has 2 more years—it has cost me >$100,000 recently not for obvious economic
reasons but because it looks like we have no one sensible in charge of the whole country

December 16

am good so far

had a very productive two days with my research assistant Amy Jacobson in New Jersey
we now have 60+ papers on honour killings in Jersey and another 20 in Jamaica
especially important areas are Pakistan, Turkey (Kurds), Saudi Arabia and India

lots of variation in mating system, form of homicide, reasons given, frequency of multiple victims and/or
multiple perpetrators, degree of retribution and so on

am working out the logical details on inheritance—females seem invariably to count for 1/2 of what a male does
in Islam

parallel-cousin marriages—father's brother—occur in the desserts of Saudi Arabia—it radiated out from there
with Islam—such systems are selected in competition with each other, as in Iraq—two paternal lineages bind
against others similarly binding

deserts in other primates are often associated with more intense male-male between group fighting, e.g.
hamadryas vs regular baboons—that we were doing more than riding the camels in the dessert is suggested by
the fact that a lactose-tolerant gene arose in that area related to the lactose of camels, so we were apparently
milking our camels !

i believe you have heard of the Enhanced Learning Foundation; it got me to where i am today on this
subject, and perhaps it may wish to go further

i intend to do a year of intense work and then summarise. i was never mentally as fast as you and i am certainly
not getting faster with age (76 this February) but i do have a good eye for fundamental logic and i believe this
will be the last serious project in my life--i will not let go until i have wrapped this whole thing up, especially

with the help of Amy, who is now putting together a master Excel file on all this

i plan a book on all of this of course, it will be co-authored by Dr Jacobson
