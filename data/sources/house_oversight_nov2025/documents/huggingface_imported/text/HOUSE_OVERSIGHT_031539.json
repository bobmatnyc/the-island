  "text": "Baylor loves its students. | love the students. We want them not only to be safe, but to flourish. We\nworked hard to achieve that goal in a fallen world, where all too often, students will yield to temptations\nall around them. We could always do more. And the silver lining of the nine-month ordeal culminating\nin the events of May 2016 is that no university is more focused on Title IX-related prevention and\neffective response than our beloved Baylor.\n\nTo be sure, there were failures and shortcomings. In particular, | lament the now-known fact that first\nresponders were, at best, insensitive to reports of sexual violence. But there are limits to what the\nUniversity can do with respect to OFF-CAMPUS behavior, especially when alcohol flows freely — and all\ntoo frequently, it flows to tragic excess. But that jurisdictional point — off-campus drinking, not\ninfrequently under-age drinking — was deemed utterly irrelevant by American culture’s ultimate\nmediator, the mainstream media, led in this instance by ESPN. Its provocative investigative reporting\navenue, “Outside the Lines,” had found a target on the banks of the Brazos. Several of us, including\nCoach Art Briles, an honorable and decent man (and football genius) would be fatally hit by the media’s\nunrelenting fusillade.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031539",
