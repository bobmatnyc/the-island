The president has been\nless outspoken about other Persian Gulf allies, including Bahrain,\nwhich hosts a key U.S. naval base. Obama has urged Egypt and\nTunisia to \"set a strong example through free and fair elections, a\nvibrant civil society, accountable and effective democratic\ninstitutions, and responsible regional leadership.\"\n\nOther issues: Although he once described himself as a George H.W.\nBush-school realist, in the past year Obama has learned to embrace\nhumanitarian intervention, both in Libya and in central Africa, where\nmilitary advisors have been sent to aid in the fight against the long-\nrunning insurgency by the Lord's Resistance Army. There's\nspeculation that Nigeria may be next. It's a measure of how much\nthings have changed in the last four years that Republicans are now\nattacking the Democratic president for trying to spread democracy\nand human rights at the barrel of a gun.\n\nAs the European economic crisis has worsened, Obama has been\nspeaking out more in support of strong measures to protect the\ncommon currency. \"Ultimately what they are going to need is a\nfirewall that sends a clear signal we stand behind the European\nproject and we stand behind the euro,\" he said during his recent trip\nto Australia.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031960",
