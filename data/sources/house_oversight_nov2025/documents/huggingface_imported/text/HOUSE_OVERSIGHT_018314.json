  "text": "win. He moved onto the next stop. Same result. And the next. Same result. Eventually\nBaran’s engineering colleagues back at RAND were so affronted by the routine\ndismissal of his logic that they spoke up. They had seen the classified briefings. They\nknew just how easily the nation could be hobbled - and their Santa Monica building\nwas surely on some target list somewhere too. RAND’s scientists demanded a\ndetailed, critical study of the “distributed network model”. By the time they were\nfinished, the Air Force was preparing to begin construction.\n\nSurvivability. Plucked from that impossible looking puzzle was the first honestly\ndistributed network. You can sense the power of this inversion: A network with no\ncentral control, survivable, uncuttable. The earliest large network built on the\nBaran’s principles became known as ARPANET, the Advanced Research Project\nAgency NETwork - a mesh of connections that, even today, serves as the backbone\nfor parts of the Internet. Even with the risk of nuclear war (hopefully) long gone,\npacket switching networks of one sort or another still account for most of the data\nmoving in the world. Think of how true, how heat-hardened and useful an idea must\nbe to endure more than fifty years of technological change. And all the efficiencies\nBaran first predicted 50 years ago on his slide rules are still at work. Every time you\nmake a call, share a video or ask a machine to think for you, that whole transaction\nlikely takes place through fishnet routed packets. If we had stayed with that old\nAT&T model, we'd be living in a different world. Riots would be flipped off with a\nsingle switch. Data flows would be monitored with the ease of watching a subway\nturnstile. The far flung, wild creativity of our plug-and-play connected world would\nbe stilted, stifled. Each additional connection to the system would demand\nbureaucratic central approval by the Switch Despots, concerned more with their\nown power more than their survival. Instead, we have a slice-resistant mesh that\nhas grown by a billion times over, with its original architecture largely intact.\n\nPacket switched systems such as the Internet mean that anyone with some string\nand an ability to tie knots (which, in tech-speak, is anyone with some blinking fiber\noptics and a TCP/IP connection) can add themselves into the global web. They can\nconnect. They can share. Practically, this is why you can so easily snap your phone\nor tablet on and touch, more or less instantly, a whole world of data. Every minute\nnow an additional 10,000 devices are connected to the Internet. Medical tools,\nBitcoin mines, airplane diagnostic systems - and of course wired citizens, smart-\nphones and laptops and tablets. This ease of connection is an implicit part of a\nSeventh Sense worldview. Anyone can connect. It’s as fundamental as Luther’s “Let\nanyone can speak to God.” Or Kant’s “Dare to know.” When someone says “Why\nwould anyone want to share photos with the world?” or “Why would you ever hand\nyour DNA over?” they are missing the point that many objects now are only\ncomplete or useful once they’re connected. When we say “connection changes the\nnature of an object” we’re nodding towards the idea that constant connection is\nalmosta kind of right for devices and programs and people. Anyhow, it is certainly\na kind of yearning.\n\nWhen we described network power as stretched between distribution and\nconcentration, we should understand too that it is this design of Baran’s that\n\n82\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018314",
