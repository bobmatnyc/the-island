In 1999, I received a letter of thanks from the head of that shadowy\norganization, which included the following:\n\n“T remember the energy you showed when we came to you seeking both advice and\naction. You threw yourself into the fray and showed every possible willingness to give us\nboth your time and renowned counsel.\n\n>\n\nAs you know, there is no greater “Mitzva” in Judaism than “Pidyon Shevuyim”—prisoner\nrelease. And nevertheless, not every person would be prepared to be associated with “one\nof us.” So be it you, for your part, acted in the best and nobles of our traditions.\n\nWe wish you well; we thank you for what you did and what you were willing to do. May\nwe all live to see the day when a profession such as mine gives way to more pleasant\noccupations. There is still some way to go before this comes about.”\n\nTragically, the world is still far from a time when those brave men and women who serve in the\nUnited States and Israeli armed forces and intelligence services can pursue “more pleasant\n\noccupations.” Until that day arrives, I will always remain available to lend my time and counsel in\nsupport of their noble efforts to combat evil.\n\n212\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017299",
