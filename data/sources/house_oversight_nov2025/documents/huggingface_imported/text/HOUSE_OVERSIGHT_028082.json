  "text": "The Israeli public’s concern over a possible Iraqi attack was growing by the\nday, in part because of the precautionary measures we’d taken. We had handed\nout gas masks to the whole country. Though I’d been concerned that might raise\nthe prospect of a chemical attack, I still thought a chemical strike was highly\nunlikely. The government rightly decided that nor distributing the masks would\nbetray a fundamental responsibility to the safety of our citizens. We’d also\nissued instructions about how to equip a room, usually the shelter included in\nnearly every Israeli home, as a cheder atum, or “sealed room” to keep gas from\ngetting in. The Israeli media was full of speculation about the likely effects of a\nchemical attack. Many families had begun panic buying of food and other\nnecessities to prepare for the possibility of days and nights in their sealed\nshelters.\n\nIn my report for Dan, Misha and Shamir a few weeks before the war, I drew\non systematic analysis by a team of experts in the Israeli air force and made my\nmost specific estimate yet of the damage conventionally armed Scuds might\ncause. We had gone back into historical accounts of the closest equivalent: the\nNazis’ use of V-1 and V-2 rockets against London in the Second World War.\nGiven Saddam’s primary need to fight Americans, and the likelihood either they\nor we would take military action against the launchers, we concluded we’d be\nhit by roughly 40 missiles, and that, based on Britain’s wartime experience, up\nto 120 Israelis might lose their lives as a result.\n\nThe first air-raid sirens wailed in Israel at about 2 a.m. on January 18, 1991,\nalmost exactly 24 hours after the Americans began their bombing raids over\nBaghdad. I was home in Kochav Yair. Like other Israelis, we’d set up a sealed\nshelter. Though I felt a bit silly doing it, having assured the government Saddam\nwas vanishingly unlikely to use chemical warheads, we woke up the kids and\nNava took them inside. I put on my own gas mask. But when I ran out to my\ncar, I removed my mask and put it on the passenger’s seat before heading in to\nthe kirya. I wanted to get there quickly enough so that the bor, the underground\ncommand bunker, wouldn’t have to reopened when I arrived. I took a short-cut,\nthrough the West Bank town of Qalqilya. That was, to put it mildly, stupid.\nAlthough the intifada had become steadily less intense during the build-up to\nthe war, it wasn’t completely over.
