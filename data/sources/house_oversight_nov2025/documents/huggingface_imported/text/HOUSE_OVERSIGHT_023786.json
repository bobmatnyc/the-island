  "text": "40 Teaching Minds\n\nthinking? Nothing. He was thinking nothing. Correct action is rarely\nabout thought, especially when little time for thinking is available.\n\nSo, then, how do we teach people to do the right thing, especially\nwhen the right thing is not in line with their normal behavior?\n\nCan we teach nurturance, or aggression, or extroversion, or or-\nderliness? I hope that it is obvious that we cannot do this. People are\nborn with these characteristics. They are not learned. Ask any parents\nof more than one child. They will respond that their children had\ncertain personality traits that were apparent from birth. My grandson\nMilo is a neatnik. Everything has to be in its place. Also, he loves to\nperform in front of an audience. His parents do not share and did not\nteach him these behaviors. The degree to which we have such traits\ndefines our innate personalities. So, we need to translate this question\ninto one we can answer.\n\nThe real issue is one of degree and not of kind. You will never\nteach someone who is fundamentally dishonest to be very honest,\nor vice versa. You will never teach someone who is very aggressive to\nbe very passive. What you can do is make people aware of the conse-\nquences of their actions and hope to change their behavior slightly,\nwhen they have the time to think about what they are about to do.\nYou can make people aware of their behavior, and their rational selves\ncan direct what they do, if they have time to think about. But their\nsubconscious is likely to want them to behave differently, and it is\ntheir subconscious that is usually in charge in a pinch.\n\nSomeone who hates details is not a good candidate for being\ntaught to read contracts in detail. Similarly, someone who loves de-\ntails is not a great candidate for sales rep. (Why? Because being very\npeople-oriented is actually a characteristic that never goes hand in\nhand with being detail-oriented.) So, it is not uncommon for com-\npanies to be faced with the arduous task of training their salespeople\nto pay attention to detail. Telling them to hire differently is hopeless,\nbecause people who are both very detail-oriented and love engaging\npeople socially do not exist. Accountants don’t usually win personal-\nity contests. What to do?\n\nThis is indeed a job for teaching but not for teaching of the usual\nsort. To see what kind of job it is, we need to think for a moment about\nhow the mind works. Specifically, we need to think about how the\nunconscious learns to make decisions.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023786",
