[jeevacation@gmail.com]\nSubject: Fwd: Kuhn - Breakthroughs (and Trump)\n\nImportance: — High\n\nBegin forwarded message:\n\nFrom: Robert Kuhn <\n\nSubject: Kuhn - Breakthroughs (and Trump)\nDate: December 29, 2017 at 3:21:43 PM EST\nTo: \"jeffrey E.\" <jeevacation@qmail.com>\nTerrific; looking forward.\n\nExcited to go through math candidates on the list, others too.\n\nEqually important, discuss edits/modifications to the 13 episodes (cutting blahs), expanding math episodes - see\nbelow. Assuming we expand math episodes, we will need more mathematicians.\n\nHow’s late afternoon after 5:30 pm / early evening today? - or weekend, day/times? (Family issues today -\nmother 102 in May.)\n\nRADICAL BREAKTHROUGHS - Initial Revisions (working model for discussion, red is new)\n\nExpand and Modify Mathematical Breakthrough episodes\n1. Mathematics and Truth / Overview / Show Excitement/Importance\n2. Mathematical Fields / Diverse New Kinds and Categories\n\n3. How Math Works in Disparate Areas of Knowledge (from fundamental physics to chemistry, biology\n[molecular and evolutionary|, psychology, sociology, economics, etc.)\n\n4. Power Laws\n5. Mathematical Biology\n\n6. Foundations of Mathematics / Philosophy/Meaning of Math (discovered/invented?)\n\nADD/Exchange to Biological Breakthrough episodes\n\n9/10. Replicability Crisis - Problems in Statistics in Search for Truth. Deep problems of replicability in\nbiomedical and psychological research - the scandal in recent years.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029150",
