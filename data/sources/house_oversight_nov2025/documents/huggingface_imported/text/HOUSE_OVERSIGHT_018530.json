  "text": "I was about to head out to the wedding when I received an email from Mr. Thereltls:\n\nSo my txt was not really well-considered. I was delaying writing you because I've got\nmixed and confusing inclinations about all this and was hoping I could figure them out\nbefore writing. So I spent last night drinking too much and ranting with friends about\nunrelated topics, which surprise turned out to not have helped me figure my shit out at\nall.\n\nI'm just feeling intimidated and uncertain about our kinkiness. On one hand I've been\nfeeling \"aaa this is weird, run away\". But I'm also feeling like this is fun and new and hot\nand fascinating, and I should get over my bs and try it again. So if you can forgive my\nimpulsive txt and my erratic emotions.... I'm free on your free nights this week.\n\nAnd if I've spooked you or your schedule has filled up, then I would be disappointed... but\nI'd understand. Sorry about the drama. I'm usually drama-free, I swear.\n\nIt was amazing how much further my internal anxieties resolved themselves upon receipt\nof this email: it was not only concrete evidence that men are human beings who are\nfrequently just as confused as I am; not only concrete evidence that men are different\nfrom each other, and assumptions should not be made about how they're feeling; but\nalso, it was concrete evidence that a man (a vanilla-but-questioning man, no less!) might\nnot inevitably fall into the stereotypes that feed my fears.\n\nI was still a little bit spooked, of course, but I did indeed see Mr. Thereltls later that\nweek, and it turned out great. And as I was pulling myself together to leave his\napartment, I raised my eyebrows at him. \"I don't know if I'll ever see you again,” I said,\nfishing. I didn't have any nights open before I was due to catch my plane out of the city,\nbut maybe some other time....\n\n\"You'll see me again,\" he obliged.\nI zipped up my backpack. \"I wonder why we have so much chemistry.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, \"but I'll read about it on your blog when you figure it out,” and he\nlaughed and caught my wrists when I pretended to punch him. It was such a stupidly\nadorable moment that I am almost ashamed to write it down, but it was also such a\ncypress moment, I've got to mention it.\n\nAs for The Artist, we went to a charming museum a few days before I left, and had a fine\nold time. There was almost no tension at all. Right before we parted, we inevitably ended\nup discussing our brief romance, and the conversation was gloriously friendly. \"No hard\nfeelings,\" I said as I walked him to the bus, and meant it.\n\nI then tried to walk away from the bus, but it turned at the same corner I did and chased\nme down the street. Ack, I couldn't help thinking, so much for a nice clean exit. I was\nsuddenly possessed by ridiculous performance anxiety, knowing he could see me, so I\npaused and took a drag of a passing gentleman's cigarette, and then deliberately\nzigzagged away from the bus again.\n\nThe Artist texted me fifteen seconds later: \"That puff of a cigarette looked mighty tasty.\"\n\n\"I needed it to relieve my feelings of being watched from the bus,\" I texted back, then\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018530",
