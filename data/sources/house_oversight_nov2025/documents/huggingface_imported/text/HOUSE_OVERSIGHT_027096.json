BENNETT\nCQ-Roll Call\n\nWASHINGTON — _ White\nHouse press secretary Sarah Huck-\nabee Sanders on Friday declined\nto say whether President Donald\nTrump still has confidence in La-\nbor Secretary Alexander Acosta, a\nday after a federal judge ruled the\nJustice Department broke the law\nwhile Acosta was a U.S. attorney.\n\nA judge said Acosta — then the\nU.S. attorney in Miami — signed\noff on a plea deal with Jeffrey Ep-\nstein, the Palm Beach billionaire\nand serial sex abuser, without in-\nforming victims about what they\nwere doing.\n\nEpstein also owns the island\nof Little St. James in the Virgin\nIslands,\n\n“My understanding is that it’s\na very complicated case, some-\nthing we're certainly looking into,”\nSanders said.\n\nThe  Florida-\nbased U.S. Dis-\ntrict Judge Ken-\nneth A. Marra\nruled Acosta and\nother — officials\ndid not confer\nwith — Epstein’s\n: victims about\nJeffrey Epstein the 2008 plea\n\nagreement, But,\nnotably, she appeared to defend the\nlabor boss.\n\n“But that they made the best\npossible deal that they could have\ngotten at that time,” she said. “But,\nagain, that’s something we're look-\ning into.”\n\nA federal judge said U.S. Labor Secretary Alexander\nAcosta — then the U.S. attorney in Miami — signed\noff on a plea deal with Jeffrey Epstein, the Palm Beach\nbillionaire and serial sex abuser, without informing the\ndozens of victims about what they were doing.\nEpstein also owns the island of little St. James in the\n\nVirgin Islands.\n\nAsked if Trump still has confi-\ndence in the latest member of his\nCabinet — which he frequently\npraises as doing a collective solid\njob — Sanders declined to say\nthe president does. “Again, that’s\nsomething we're looking into,” the\nspokeswoman said, “I'm not aware\nof any changes.”\n\nThe judge said in his decision\nThursday that he had reviewed\nevidence showing Epstein sexu-\nally abused more than 30 underage\ngirls at his Palm Beach mansion\nand elsewhere.\n\nThe Crime Victims’ Rights Act\npromises victims that the Justice\nDepartment would make its “best\n\nefforts” to protect a victim, the fil-\ning said. It allows victims the “rea-\nsonable right” to confer with the\nU.S. attorneys handling the case.\n\nThe deal reached between Acos-\nta and Epstein’s attorneys allowed\nhim to not be prosecuted in fed-\neral court, and instead sentenced\nin state court. The immunity from\nprosecution also extended to some\nof Epstein’s co-conspirators.\n\nEpstein pleaded guilty to two\nprostitution charges and served 13\nmonths in county jail, according\nto the Miami Herald. The victims\nwere not told of the agreement or\nsentencing until it was too late to\nintervene,\n\nThe Department of Justice an-\nnounced earlier this month it has\nopened an investigation into the\nhandling of Epstein’s case.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027096",
