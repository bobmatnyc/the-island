EDWARDS: This again is nonresponsive\n\nto the question.\n\nSPECIAL MASTER POZZUOLI: Let me stop --\n\nrepeat the question so we can get an answer.\n\nBY MR. EDWARDS:\n\nQ. The question is, were you sent a waiver of\nthe statute of limitations to sign so that Virginia\nRoberts could bring that lawsuit? Were you?\n\nA. I don't believe that's right. I don't\nbelieve that's right. I don't believe that I was\nsent a -- something that would give her the\nopportunity -- a waiver to file that lawsuit.\nThat's not my recollection. If you show it to me,\nmaybe my recollection will be refreshed.\n\nI had talked about the statute of\nlimitations for criminal purpose was what I said,\nthat I would waive the statute of limitations for\ncriminal purposes. If a prosecutor were to\ninvestigate this case and come to the conclusion\nthat there was probable cause that I had committed\nany offense with Virginia Roberts, I would then\n\nwaive the statute of limitations.\n\n©. .
