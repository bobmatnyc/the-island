  "text": "e Partnered with: American Medical Assoc. Am Bar Assoc, Aol, etc\ne $67 million in venture capital to date.\ne CEO is Michael Fertik\n\nCEO and Founder\n\nMichael Fertik founded Reputation.com in 2006\n\nwith the belief that people have the right to control\nand protect their online reputation and privacy. In\naddition to his work with Reputation.com, Michael\nholds a position on the advisory board of The Internet\nKeepsafe Coalition (iKeepSafe), a nonprofit that\nworks to protect the health and safety of youth online.\nMichael is regarded as one of the earliest pioneers of\nonline reputation management and a leading expert\non issues of online privacy. He co-authored the book\nWild West 2.0 and lectures internationally, appearing\nbefore professional and academic audiences. Michael\nalso advises school administrators and parent groups.\nPrior to founding Reputation.com, Michael clerked for\nChief Judge Danny J. Boggs of the Sixth Circuit Court\nof Appeals of the United States. He is a graduate of\nHarvard College and Harvard Law School, speaks\nseveral languages, and enjoys sailing, reading, and\nrunning.\n\nTIME FRAME & FEES\n\nTheir “Picasso” Tech services described in step 2, will take approx. 3 months to eliminate bad press from the\n1t and 2\"4 page. The whole process will take about a year to be solidified. Fees will be approx. $10k -$15k\nper month but depends on each case and costs can be kept down by providing content and selecting only\ntruly necessary services.\n\nWIKIPEDIA\n\nThis is a tough nut to crack. And | need to do more research on this. Wiki comes up first on the\nGoogle list due to its powerful domain and contains totally lopsided and damning content on you.\n\nBut we'll crack it. On the surface, Wiki is controlled by a morass of copyediting geeks who have\nnothing better to do than to discuss reference tags etc. It is also ‘the people’s’ encyclopedia,\ndictated by the tyranny of the majority—so no objectivity at all.\n\nCurrent Strategy— 1. The Reputation group have a copyright team dedicated to balancing the\ncontent on Wikipedia and gradually sectioning the bad stuff down to sub categories in the profile.\nThey don’t seem to be able to eliminate the bad though. 2. So, | think it’s worth seeing how people\nlike Prince Andrew managed to create an absolutely stellar profile—or Bill Clinton for that matter.\nNo mention of his impeachment or lying to the Grand Jury. It barely touches on Lewinsky etc. 3.\nThere are also protected pages on Wiki but | need more time and research.\n\nWEBSITE\n\nYou need to update your website immediately by adding the bio on you from The Edge if you can\nand adding a longer summary of science and scientists that you are/have worked with.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025234",
