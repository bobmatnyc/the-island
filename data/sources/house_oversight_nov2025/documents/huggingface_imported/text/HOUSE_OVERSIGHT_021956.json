I can not \nhave press, media, private investigators, film companies, etc. contacting me or my parents and sisters at home or on \ncell/texts and or by mail. I realize you don't have much control over this, but you can at least help me to move. I \ncan't just get up and go like you. I left the city to escape, make a better life and I am devastated these people found \nme and brought to light an association of that I would rather them never to know. People think I was involved with \nsomething really bad and I lost a boyfriend of great potential over this shit. I am still in debt over all these years, \nbeen working my ass off trying to get ahead, which you could never understand I was even surviving off the pay I \nwas getting. Well, its not any better. I dropped out of college because of you (and GM's) advice. Started working \nfor a company you wanted me to and basically my life has has become hell since then. \nI have been your supporter for 16 years, the media explosion with Clinton, Trump and Cosby is affecting me. I'm \nnot prepared for this. \nplease note \nThe information contained in this communication is \nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may \nconstitute inside information, and is intendec• for \nthe use of the addressee.
