  "text": "capitals and traditional power centers into a world where their ideas and policies\nconstantly fail. They don’t understand networks; never will. At the same time a new,\nrising generation lashes us into connected and amazing meshes. We welcome this\nconnection. Centered in Menlo Park or Seattle or Zhonguancun or Shenzhen, these\nfigures understand networks perfectly, but not yet much else. Old and new, each\ngroup works anyhow on our freedom. We are pulled dangerously between these\nforces. Problems seem to get worse. What we need to find is a way out of this trap. A\nfusion. A blended sensibility of both the edgiest ideas of connection and the most\nunshakeable and brutal and inarguable requirements of power. This is the Seventh\nSense. It is our only possible protection.\n\n5.\n\nIn the last century, as the economist Fredrich Hayek watched Europe both struggle\nagainst and flirt with the then-appealing ideas of Nazi and Soviet socialism, he\nmarked the fundamental conflict of his age as the one between individual liberty\nand central planning. Recall that at that moment in history, the 1930s, America and\nmuch of Europe were in deep depression, their political systems struggling. The\nrapid growth in the USSR and Germany looked awfully appealing to many. The\npolitical stability of totalitarian ideologis had a certain placid charm in some\nquarters. But, Europe was, Hayek argued, walking nothing less than a road back to\nserfdom. Was man happier, better off, more justly fulfilled by the chaos of a market\nand democracy or in the orderly machine of authority, of clicking heels and\nmachines? Hayek voted with his feet. He fled the Nazis in 1938, and he worried for\nthe rest of his life that in the attempt to manage the risks of free markets and minds,\nthe Europe he loved was running into socialism. “Is there a greater tragedy\nimaginable,” Hayek wrote, “than that we should unwittingly produce the very\nopposite of what we have been striving for?”32\n\nHayek thought two safety catches of might protect mankind from the totalizing\ncontrol habits of Soviet-style thinking: First, an unkillable human instinct for\nindividual freedom, the squirm humans have always shown under the boot of too\nmuch authority. And, a second protection he thought, would be the really terrible,\nabsurd inefficiency of centrally planned systems. No bureaucrat, no economist,\ncould possibly out-perform the productive chaos of a market or an election in the\nlong run Hayek felt. Finding the right price, matching supply and demand - it was\nimpossible to think this could be done by some technocrat in a room somwhwere.\nThis was what markets were for. This is how they encouraged profit, free-thinking,\ninvention. Chuchill’s famous line, that “Democracy is the worst form of government\nexcept for all the others,” contained a certain truth: civilizations, yoked by\ndemocratic and market rules, reached more durable outcomes than despots or\noligarchs. Hayek, as we look at his judgment now, was correct. People wanted to be\nfree; the dream of central planning collapsed under its own weight with the USSR in\n1989,\n\n32 “Is there a greater tragedy”: F.A.
