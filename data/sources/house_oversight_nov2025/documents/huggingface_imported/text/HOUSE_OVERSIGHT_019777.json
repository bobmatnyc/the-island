He there-\nfore must have obtained that assistance from someone who had the\npasswords and privileges. Other workers there might have shared\nhis sensibilities and antipathy toward NSA surveillance. It there-\nfore seems entirely plausible that he found a co-worker willing to\ncooperate or, vice versa, a co-worker found him. Snowden might\nnot have been aware of his new accomplice’s true motives or affili-\nations, but without some co-worker’s providing him with entry to\nthe sealed-off computers, he could not have carried out the penetra-\ntion. To our knowledge, whoever helped him evidently did not want\nto expose himself to prosecution or defect from the NSA. That was\nSnowden’s role. By accepting the sole blame in the video that Poitras\nmade about him in Hong Kong, Snowden shielded anyone else from\nsuspicion, which was, as he told Poitras, his purpose. Whoever helped\nhim may still be working at the NSA.\n\nTo be sure, there remains that other glaring gap in the chain of\nevents that led Snowden to Moscow: his whereabouts and activi-\nties during his first eleven days in Hong Kong. Mike Rogers, the\n\n© chairman of the House Select Committee on Intelligence, even sug- ®\ngested, without any evidence, that Snowden might have been taken\nto mainland China during this period.

It was, in a phrase made famous by the former secretary\nof defense Donald Rumsfeld, “a known unknown.” Just as likely he\ncould have been staying in a well-prepared safe house anywhere in\nHong Kong or even at the home of an unknown associate. All that is\nreally known is that soon after he emerged from this venue, moved\nto the Mira hotel, and gave his celebrated interview to journalists, he\nwas safely settled in Russia.\n\nSnowden’s actions appear squarely at odds with his assertions of\nserving his country’s interests. Even accepting that he began with a\nsincere desire to be a world-class whistle-blower, his mission evolved,\ndeliberately or not, into one that led him to disclose key communica-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 289 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019777",
