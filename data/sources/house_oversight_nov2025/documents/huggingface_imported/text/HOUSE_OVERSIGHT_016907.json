  "text": "GRADIENT DESCENT\nChris Anderson\n\nChris Anderson is an entrepreneur; former editor-in-chief of Wired; co-founder and\nCEO of 3DR; and author of The Long Tail, Free, and Makers.\n\nLife\n\nThe mosquito first detects my scent from thirty feet away. It triggers its pursuit function,\nwhich consists of the simplest possible rules. First, move in a random direction. If the\nscent increases, continue moving in that direction. If the scent decreases, move in the\nopposite direction. If the scent is lost, move sideways until a scent is picked up again.\nRepeat until contact with the target is achieved.\n\nThe plume of my scent is densest next to me and disperses as it spreads, an\ninvisible fog of particles exuded from my skin that moves like smoke with the wind. The\ncloser to my skin, the higher the particle density; the farther away, the lower. This\ndecrease 1s called a gradient, which describes any gradual transition from one level to\nanother one—as opposed to a “step function,” which describes a discrete change.\n\nOnce the mosquito follows this gradient to its source using its simple algorithm, it\nlands on my skin, which it senses with the heat detectors in its feet, which are attuned to\nanother gradient—temperature. It then pushes its needle-shaped proboscis through the\nsurface, where a third set of sensors in the tip detect yet another gradient, that of blood\ndensity. This flexible needle wriggles around under my skin until the scent of blood\nsteers it to a capillary, which it punctures. Then my blood begins to flow into the\nmosquito. Mission accomplished. Ouch.\n\nWhat seems like the powerful radar of insects in the dark, with blood-seeking\nintelligence inexplicable for such tiny brains, is actually just a sensitive nose with almost\nno intelligence at all. Mosquitoes are closer to plants that follow the sun than to guided\nmissiles. Yet by applying this simple “follow your nose” rule quite literally, they can\ntravel through a house to find you, slip through cracks in a screen door, even zero in on\nthe tiny strip of skin you left exposed between hat and shirt collar. It’s just a random\nwalk, combined with flexible wings and legs that let the insect bounce off obstacles, and\nan instinct to descend a chemical gradient.\n\nBut “gradient descent” is much more than bug navigation. Look around you and\nyou'll find it everywhere, from the most basic physical rules of the universe to the most\nadvanced artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Universe\n\nWe live in a world of countless gradients, from light and heat to gravity and chemical\ntrails (chemtrails!). Water flows along a gravity gradient downhill, and your body lives\non chemical solutions flowing across cell membranes from high concentration to\n\nlow. Every action in the universe 1s driven by some gradient drive, from the movement\nof the planets around gravity gradients to the joining of atoms along electric-charge\ngradients to form molecules. Our own urges, such as hunger and sleepiness, are driven\nby electro-chemical gradients in our bodies. And our brain’s functions, the electrical\nsignals moving along ion channels in the synapses between our neurons, are simply\natoms and electrons flowing “downhill” along yet more electrical and chemical gradients.\n\n104\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016907",
