At one point in its history, Haiti\nwas a market leader in the textile industry supplying quality products. Currently there is an\nopportunity to provide sustainable employment for Haitians with the right training to develop an\nindustry to serve as a catalyst to catapult the country out of the stigmatism of a third world country.\n‘There is a need for work to be done, such as construction of homes, infrastructure, etc.\n\nHaiti is one of the lowest-income countries in the Western hemisphere. The country has problems\nwith AIDS, crime, drug trafficking, etc. (CIA, 2010). On January 12th, 2010, an earthquake\ndestroyed the capital of the country and worsened the overall situation of Haiti. The total loss was\nestimated around $11.5 billion; however, the country still needs more time to rebuild (U.S.\nDepartment of State, 2010). The majority of the donor countries worry about Haiti becoming a\nburden throughout the years without any positive results (Novacek et. al, 2008). The country has\nboth positive and negative sides.\n\nThis business plan includes secondary data. Secondary data was selected from academic,\ngovernment, news resources or based on extensive research by those with experience in dealing\nwith Haiti. Considering retrieved data, the plan focused on the following aspects:\n\ne Past and current situations in Haiti;\n\ne <A ctitical needs assessment of Southeastern area of Haiti;\n\ne Our plan for investment in Haiti\n\nAfter the detailed investigation of the authoritative sources and critically evaluating information,\nCEFOTAJ has concluded the following:\n\ne Haiti has a potential for investment in the area of apparel/clothing.\n\ne Establishment of our trade/learning school will facilitate and foster future investments\nwithin the country via job and economic growth in the southeastern area.\n\ne Despite its economic situation, the country attracts foreign investments and investors.\ne Foreign investments and aid allow restoring the country quicker.\n\ne Foreign investments positively affect the country.\n\nPO Box 666 Brentwood, NY 11717 © Phone (631) 273-4100 © Fax (631) 273-4111 © yair@cefotaj.org © Wwww.cefotaj.org\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019450",
