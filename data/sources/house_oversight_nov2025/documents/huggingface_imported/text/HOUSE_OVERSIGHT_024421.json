  "text": "perceptions so as to restore that sense of inner control. I describe the Control Factor as an “active and\ncontinuous process” designed to maintain that sense, if not illusion, of control. We natural ly think that our\nthinking and feeling processes are passive; that they just happen. Yet when faced with truly frightening\nprospects, the mind is geared to actively distort.\n\nSimilarly, the sense of control must be continuously maintained so the Control Factor operates constantly. In\nturn, the sum of this active and continuous undertaking makes these perceptions all the more familiar and\nthus seemingly all the more “real.” In one sense, the Control Factor is the mechanism of what Andy\nMcCarthy entitled one of his numerous excellent books- willful blindness. The Control Factor is cleverer\nthan we are aware; that is almost tautological as, if our minds are to create ways to keep us in denial, they\nmust out maneuver our conscious thinking.\n\nSince World War II, America has had limited experience with threats coming to the homeland. Most of\nAmerica’s history has been about “over there,” where we have always known that if things got too out of\nhand (e.g. Vietnam) we could always ret urn home. The current generations, for a wide array of reasons,\nhave had virtually no experience with a threat to this land. (The documentary, Generation Zero, is interesting\non this point).\n\nConsequently, the process of waking up to such a threat parallels the arc of a typical horror film. In such a\nfilm, there is typically a cast of characters surrounding one or two main characters. We in the audience know\nthere is a threat coming — be it a monster, a virus, a psycho killer, an alien, the blob that ate Cincinnati etc.\nThis threat is typically defined by its intent- the singular goal of destroying the characters. Much of the initial\nexposition shows how the characters first are oblivious to the destruction the threat brings about, then explain\nit in familiar terms only to finally open their eyes to see that something uniquely terrifying is happening. The\nnext stage usually involves a series of failed attempts to deal with the threat- fr om trying to negotiate with it,\nto appease it, to coax it, to threaten it with ineffective weapons and so forth. Most of these failings are due to\nnot adequately appreciating the threat for what it truly is and projecting onto it a host of other attributes\ninstead. The final stage generally involves a back-up-against-the-wall decision by whichever characters\nremain alive. I named this the “turnaround moment” when the character becomes willing to be as ruthless as\nthe threat. That change in mental state is necessary to ensure survival. Ultimately, the storyline is a race for\nwhichever characters remain to wake up fully and use whatever advantages they may still have to beat the\nthreat.\n\nThis is the same arc our minds go through in battling our own Control Factors, our own compulsions to deny\nthat which is staring us in the face. Ultimately, the question is whether we will be able to wake up while we\nstill have advantages and give ourselves permis sion to fully fight the battle we are in.\n\nI said ear lier that there is a structure to the Control Factor. To oversimplify, I view it much as a pyramid\nwhere on the bottom are the many minute by minute thoughts that are manipulated. I call this level of\nmaneuvers the many ”D’s” as they include the psychological defenses such as distortion, denial,\ndemonization, deflection, deletion, detachment, delusion, displacement, discolorization and so forth. Layered\nupon these are moves such as projection, where we can assign to our Islamic Enemy traits we wish to see in\nthem or introject traits from them into ourselves that we wish not to acknowledge. These maneuvers involve\na mixing of identities where we actually lose clarity about who we are and who the enemy is. Projection and\nintrojection are active almost across the board. It is always helpful, for instance, to ask how what the enemy\naccuses us of is more appropriately descriptive of it. When we add Western Guilt and Shame, our need to be\nliked, and o ther psychological dimensions, basic thoughts solidify into larger fantasies.\n\nAs these narratives (“Our courts will never allow that,” “As a superpower we will always be able to win any\nfight we put our minds to,” “Assimilation will ensure Muslims are westernized” ...) gain consent from others\nthey tend to guide us deeply and become infused on our policies. Ultimately, what emerges is a relationship\nwe take with our Islamic Enemy that parallels that between an addict and an enabler. Emblematic of this\nrelationship is the “transfer of responsibility” in which we assume responsibility for the enemy’s behavior\nwho is addicted to transferring it away from itself. The Control Factor actively maintains this relationship\nand makes changing that relationship as difficult a chore as any addict finds in breaking his addiction. And\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024421",
