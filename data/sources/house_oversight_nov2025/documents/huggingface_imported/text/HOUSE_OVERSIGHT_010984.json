  "text": "Consider net gift. Its negative component, gift received, is concurrently added either\ninto total capital growth or into exhaust. Thus it is the contribution to those two\ndesiderata explained from outside, rather than by the individual’s behavior. Net gift\ndeducts that negative component (gift received) from the positive one to leave the\npart which the individual’s behavior explains. Thus individual output, as the sum of\ngrowth and net gift, is the sum of desiderata realized by behavior. That makes it the\nunique behavioral maximand as a flow. Division by the individual’s total capital,\nwhich is her whole means of behavior, gives total capital rate of return as the rate\n\nmaximand.\n\nThis can be summarized in a slightly different way. Cash flow measures the means of\ntaste satisfaction now. Total capital growth measures gain in means of expected\nsatisfactions, discounted according to our taste for impatience (time preference)\ntempered by our taste for risk aversion. Output is their sum. Behavior reveals and\nmaximizes the taste satisfaction including provision for future satisfaction.\nTherefore risk-adjusted output is the flow maximand. Capital of both factors, at\npresent value, is defined as the whole means of that satisfaction, and implicitly of\nbehavior. Therefore risk-adjusted return, the ratio of the flow maximand to its\n\nmeans, is the rate maximand.\n\nWhat Turgot said in 1766, in his Reflections, was\n\n“...as soon as the profits of one employment of money... increase or\ndiminish, capitals turn in that direction... or withdraw and turn to other\nemployments... Whatever the manner in which money is employed, its\nproduct cannot increase or diminish without all the other employments\n\nexperiencing a proportionate increase or diminution.”\n\nTurgot did not allow for risk in this quick summary, but otherwise explained the\n\nmechanics that tend to equalize return.\n\nChapter 3: Foundations 1/11/16 13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010984",
