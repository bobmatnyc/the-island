If only as an act of faith in Snowden’s\npersonal integrity, they continued to believe his avowal to Senator Humphrey that he had acted\nto protect U.S. secrets by shielding them from adversary intelligence services after he took them\nabroad. They also continued to take him at his word when he said he had destroyed all the NSA\ndocuments before going to Russia. Despite such protestation of Patriotic loyalty, U.S intelligence\nofficials could not so easily dismiss the possibility that the missing documents still existed. After\nall, a U.S intelligence worker who is dedicated to protecting American secrets from its\nadversaries does not ordinarily takes them to an adversary country. The NSA, CIA and\nDepartment of Defense therefore had little choice but to assume the worst had happened: Russia\nand China had obtained access to the “keys of the kingdom”. Whatever the extent of the actual\ndamage, it was up to General Alexander’s replacement, Admiral Michael Rogers, both to restore\nmorale and rebuilding the capabilities of America’s electronic intelligence in the wake of the\nmassive breach. According to a National Security staff member in the Obama White House, that\njob would take more than a decade. Meanwhile, Whoever now held the keys to the kingdom,\none thing was certain: the NSA had failed to protect them. This intelligence failure did not happen\nout of the blue. Meanwhile, Putin added insult to the injury by awarding the alleged perpetrator\nsanctuary in Russia.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020298",
