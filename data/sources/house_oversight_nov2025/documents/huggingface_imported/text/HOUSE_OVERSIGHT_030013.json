It was designed, engi-\nneered and is built by Greenpoint. The\ncenter is licensed by Boeing to do the\nnecessary modifications and installa-\ntion.

Two\nof them, like the first two, will go on to\nother centers for installation of the Aer-\noloft kit and for the full interior com-\npletion.

With it came SkyTheater\nfounder Gregg Launer, 52, a friendly bear of a\nman who tries for modesty but whose enthu-\nsiasm spills close to hubris when he describes\nthe custom-built entertainment package as\nbeing to the average movie experience what\nSofia Vergara is to simply being female. Launer\nis something of a likeable version of Steven\nJobs. His knowledge in the world of sound is\nsuch that he frequently stops and searches his\nvocabulary for language that the average lis-\ntener will understand. And frequently failing,\nhe will offer an apology and start over. In his\nown circle, he is often described by clients as\na genius. To lesser human beings, his thoughts\nseem to run like a pinball through the random\nlight and sound of an arcade game, with a pur-\npose difficult to recognize.\n\n“I'm a true audiophile, and what I’m\nbuilding is a sensory experience that will so\ncompletely absorb my clients that it becomes\nreality and they lose themselves in the world\n\nthat the director or cameraman or composer\n\nPHOTOS: KIRBY J. HARRISON\n\nSkyTheater founder Gregg\nLauner put nearly 1,000\nmovies into a Global\nExpress Aved.\n\nany\n\ncreated,” he explains.\nbuild every system as if it\nwere going into my own\nairplane. | want to impress\neven myself, and I’m my\nown worst critic.”\n\nHis earliest memories\nare of music and the-\nater and lying awake in\nbed and listening to leg-\nendary DJ Cousin Brucie\nlay down a cascade of rock and roll on New\nYork's powerhouse WABC. Even decades\nlater, one of his favorite toys at home is a\nRock-Ola Jukebox. “When you listen to Dean\nMartin, or Elvis, or Chuck Berry on a jukebox,\nyou're hearing rock and roll the way it was\nmade to be heard,” he avows.\n\nAnd he recalls a summer when his parents\ntook him on vacation to the Deauville Beach\nResort in Miami Beach, where The Supremes\nwere performing. “They were in the room\nacross the hall from us, and Mary Wilson and\nFlo Ballard shared a cabana next to ours. | was\ntoo young to attend the show, but the resort\nmanager had mercy on me, took me by the\nhand and put me in the front row.”\n\nBy the age of 18, Launer held a first-class\nradiotelephone license from the FCC and by 19\nwas an audio engineer producing music tracks\nat NBC in Miami. And along the way, he also\nindulged what he describes as his alternative\npassion of flying, picking up his private license\nand going on to become a flight instructor.\n\nAt the age of 32, he and wife, Blanche,\nformed a company that two years later became\n\n26 Aviation International News ¢ July 2012 ¢ www.ainonline.com\n\nSkyTheater. And as if life had determined to\ncreate a movie script for him, Launer’s first cus-\ntomer and later friend was Alexander Zuyev,\nthe pilot who defected in spectacular man-\nner from the former Soviet Union in 1989, at\nthe same time delivering a MiG-29 into west-\nern hands. “He loved America and would have\nthe most incredible Fourth of July parties. But\ninstead of beer and burgers, he would serve\nvodka and caviar. It was his belief in me that\nhelped launch SkyTheater.”\n\nGetting Off the Ground\n\nLauner’s first theater in the sky was for busi-\nnessman and entrepreneur Wayne Huizenga\nof Blockbuster and the airplane was a BAC\n1-11. Then came a Boeing 727-200 and Launer\nwas off and running.\n\nIt was a time when digital technology\nwas in its infancy and the reliability was still\nin question. So Launer devised a way for all\nthe soundtracks to play through a single sys-\ntem (either 7.1 or 5.1 surround sound), with\n19-inch touchscreen, video monitor/control-\nlers throughout the cabin and two 43-inch\nplasma monitors. “Ten years later,” claims\nLauner, “that airplane was still state of the art.”\n\nIn the late 1990s some of those working for\nproducer/director George Lucas’ Skywalker\nRanch happened to listen to the SkyTheater\nsystem Launer had installed in the 727. He was\nimmediately recruited and spent the next two\nyears—off and on-there, working and learning.\nLauner remembers being “incredibly fortu-\nnate” to be part of a group that was “setting\nthe standards that still exemplify visual film\nand movie soundtracks today.”\n\nA pouang farmer cet et to final hi\n\ndestiny afer accudemtaly\nnipreeping a capnerl princeaa's —\n\nIn the meantime, Launer had formed a Sky-\nTheater partnership in Fort Lauderdale with\nfriend and fellow traveler Andrew Guenther,\nwho owns Advanced Audio Design, a home-\ntheater firm in Sarasota, Fla.\n\n“He handles a lot of the equipment and\ndesigns the electronics that make everything\nwork. Andrew does a guy’s home theater, and\nif the guy owns an airplane, SkyTheater does\nthe cabin entertainment,” says Launer.\n\nGuenther’s talent and influence is such,\nclaims Launer, “that high-end audiovisual elec-\ntronics manufacturers will often come to him\nfor his input before introducing some new\ntechnology at a major trade show.”\n\nAmong Guenther’s home theater custom-\ners are movie actor John Travolta, basketball\n\n“\n\ncoach Pat Riley, singer Gloria Estefan “and\nmore who prefer not to be named,” he says.\nThough focused on two different theater\nmarkets, Guenther and Launer are involved\ntogether in a music project designed to\n\n“recruit and produce live venues for musicians\n\natinues on page 28\n\nGoodrich Near Completion\n\nLast year, United Technologies\nagreed to the acquisition of Goodrich\nin a deal that called for UT to shell out\n$16.5 billion cash and assume $1.9\nbillion in assumed debt.
