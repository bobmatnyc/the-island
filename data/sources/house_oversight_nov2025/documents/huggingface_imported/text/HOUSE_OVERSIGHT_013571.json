This followed\nthe earlier work of the French engineer, Nicolas Leonard Sadi Carnot, who was\ntrying to develop a theoretical framework within which efficiencies in heat-\n\ngenerating engines might be understood. It implicated positive, > 0, changes, d, in\nentropy, S, with changes in time, ¢, .e. “ > 0, entropy is increasing in time, as a\n\nconcomitant of the inevitable mechanical inefficiencies in an energy driven system.\nThe resulting losses in the form of wasted energy show up as increases in\nmolecular motion, which could be estimated from the increases in heat. Wasted\nenergy dissipated as heat increases the amount of random motion and volume\noccupied by the surrounding molecules in physical processes involving heat,\npressure, vaporization, condensation and work; all elements of that era’s dominant\n\nphysical metaphor, the steam engine.\n\nThe highly developed, multifaceted, often quite abstract formal\ncharacteristics of the inferred property, entropy, prevent glib definitions and\ngeneralizations. In the context of Kelvin-Clausius theory, the entropy of a closed\nsystem will remain the same if it is isolated from any matter or energy exchanges\nwith the environment. If heating a system such that the change, d, in heat, Q, is\npositive, i.e. dQ > 0, it experiences a rearrangement in its microstructural motions,\nbut the temperature is left unchanged. The (inferred) entropy, S, increases (i.e., dS\n\n> Q) as the ratio of change in added heat, dQ, over the unchanging, absolute\n\n71\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013571",
