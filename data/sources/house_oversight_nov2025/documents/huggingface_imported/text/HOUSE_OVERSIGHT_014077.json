  "text": "98 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\nthe criminal justice process.*!* Moreover, every state has adopted a statute\nthat either enforces its constitutional amendment or creates independent\nstatutory rights for crime victims.”'” As a result, state legislatures and state\nemployees have attempted to give victims a voice in the criminal justice\nprocess across the country.\n\nNotably, while the strength of these rights varies from state to state,\nnearly forty states require the prosecuting attorney to notify or confer with\nthe victim regarding plea negotiations.**’ Several jurisdictions involve the\nvictim in the charging decision.” In some states, law enforcement and\nprosecutors must involve the victim at any “critical’”?”? 14 stage\n\n220\n\nor “crucia\nof the criminal proceeding; and in a minority of jurisdictions, the judge\nmust ascertain whether the prosecutor has afforded the victim statutory\nprotections prior to accepting a plea agreement.””°\n\nThe general contours of state provisions suggest that several state\ngovernments have recognized the value in informing victims of their nghts\nand involving them in the criminal process prior to the formal filing of\ncharges.”*° Indeed, a brief look at the statutory protections illustrates the\nextent to which states have attempted to afford protections to victims long\nbefore the formal filing of charges.\n\n718 See Victims’ Rights Laws by State, NAT’L CRIME VictTIM L. INsT. (Oct. 17, 2013),\nhttp: //goo.gl/pdDx1 w (listing and linking to state laws and constitutional amendments).\n\n719 See LAFAVEET AL., supra note 168, § 21.3(f), at 1041-42.\n\n220 See generally DEAN G. KILPATRICK ET AL., NAT’L INsT. oF Justice, U.S. DEp’T oF\nJUSTICE, THE RIGHTS OF CRIME VICTIMS—DOES LEGAL PROTECTION MAKE A DIFFERENCE?\n(1998), available at http://go0.g//EzH61S.\n\n21 See Peggy M. Tobolowsky, Victim Participation in the Criminal Justice Process:\nFifteen Years After the President’s Task Force on Victims of Crime, 25 NEw ENG. J. oN\nCRIM. & CIV. CONFINEMENT 21, 64 & n.168 (1999) (citing to victims’ rights statutes in\nConnecticut, Hlinois, and Michigan, among others). Unfortunately, as some commentators\nhave noted, the notice and conferral provisions in some states are ambiguous, and the\nabsence of case law precludes a definitive understanding of the reach of the night in some\nJurisdictions. See LAFAVEET AL., supra note 168, § 21.3(f), at 1041-42; see also, e.g., KAN.\nStat. ANN. § 74-7333(a)(5) (2002) (“The views and concerns of victims should be\nascertained and the appropriate assistance provided throughout the criminal process.”). In\nsome jurisdictions, the ambiguous use of an illustrative list could be read as suggesting that a\nparticular right, such as conferral, hinges on formal charges. See, e.g., Ky. REV. STaT. ANN.\n§ 421.500(6) (LexisNexis Supp. 2012) (requiring consultation on “disposition of the case\nincluding dismissal, release of defendant pending judicial proceedings, any conditions of\nrelease, a negotiated plea, and entry into a pretrial diversion program,” but failing to define\n“disposition” or “case”).\n\n22 See Tobolowsky, supra note 221, at 59-60.\n\n223 Bg., LA. REV. STAT. ANN. §§ 46:1842(2), 46:1844(K) (2010).\n\n24 Fg. FLA. Const. art. I, § 16(b) (refraining from identifying the term).\n\n225 See LAFAVEETAL., supra note 168, § 21.3(f), at 1041.\n\n26 See Victims’ Rights Laws by State, supra note 218.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014077",
