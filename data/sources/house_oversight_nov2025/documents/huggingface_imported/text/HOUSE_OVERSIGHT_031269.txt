Is this a reasonable response? Should i even respond? Could use advice.
Mutual decisions about meeting and everything else at the time. I assumed that was clear.

Dear Dr. Krauss,
Apologies for the multiple emails.

Regarding #1, you say it "refers to a consensual encounter in my hotel room in 2006 where we mutually
decided, in a polite discussion in fact, that taking it any further would not be appropriate, and there were
respectful and platonic encounters afterwards."

To clarify, are you saying that this mutual decision was reached in the hotel room? Or was this discussed
subsequently?

Sincerely,
Peter Aldhous
