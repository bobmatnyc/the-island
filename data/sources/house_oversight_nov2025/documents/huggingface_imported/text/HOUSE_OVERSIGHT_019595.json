When Lana Lam asked\nSnowden on June 12, 2013, whether he had already requested asy-\nlum from the Russian government, he deferred, saying, “My only\ncomment is that I am glad there are governments that refuse to be\nintimidated by great power.” The Russian government was clearly\nnot intimidated by the threats of reprisals by the United States, as\nthe Obama administration would learn after Snowden’s arrival in\nRussia on June 23. Snowden could only have known that with cer-\ntainty on June 12 if he had been in contact with Russian officials\nprior to his interview with Lam.\n\nIf Putin’s own description of Snowden’s interactions with the\nRussians in Hong Kong is to be believed, the decision to facilitate\nSnowden’s escape to Russia had been kicked all the way up the Rus-\nsian chain of command to Putin. Presumably, this decision-making\nprocess began earlier than June 21, when Snowden was said to have\ngone to the consulate. But how much earlier? Because Snowden had\narrived in Hong Kong on May 20, his contacts with Russian offi-\ncials could have occurred in May. Such a contact with the Russians\n\n© would fit with Snowden’s telling Gellman on May 24 that he needed ®\nhis help in dealing with the diplomatic mission of a country that\nSnowden did not identify.\n\nIn any case, Putin said an American “agent of the special services”\nhad contacted Russian diplomats because he wanted assistance. The\nagent, Snowden, of course, needed assistance to escape from Hong\nKong. The decision to accept him in Russia, given the international\nramifications, would have to be made at a much higher level than the\nRussian mission in Hong Kong.\n\nNine days before Snowden boarded Aeroflot Flight SU213 to\nMoscow on June 23, the United States had filed a criminal complaint\nagainst him. It had also officially alerted Interpol when it unsealed\nthe complaint on June 21. It had invalidated his U.S. passport except\nto return to America (although he still had it in his possession at\nthe Hong Kong airport). Because by this time he was the most\nfamous visitor in Hong Kong, his passage through passport control\non June 23 might have reflected the acquiescence of the Hong Kong\nauthorities to the reported request of China to be rid of Snowden by\nthat date.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 107 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019595",
