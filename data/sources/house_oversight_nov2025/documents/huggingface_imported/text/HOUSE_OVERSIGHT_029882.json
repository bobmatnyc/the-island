Milton Center is a\nDepartment of Juvenile Justice facility; therefore | will need to get her records from DJJ. DJJ will not release the records\nwithout a signed release by Jane Doe. | have attached a general HIPPA release for your review. Would you please have\nJane Doe sign it? DJJ does not have a standard form.\n\nAlso, will you agree to one more week on Responses to Net Wirth ROGS??\n\nPlease let me know.\n\nJess —\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029882",
