  "text": "Chapter Two\n\nThe 1948 war and the decade that followed remain vivid in my mind not just\nfor the obvious reason: they secured the survival of the infant state of Israel and\nsaw it into a more assured and independent young adulthood. It was also the\ntime when I grew from a young child —introspective and contemplative, aware\nof how quickly my mind seemed to grasp numbers and geometric shapes and\nmusical notes, but also small for my age and awkward at the sports we’d play\non the dusty field at the far edge of the kibbutz — into a sense of my own place\nin the family and community and the country around me. I did, along the way,\nbecome arguably the most effective left defensive back on our kibbutz soccer\nteam. But that was not because I suddenly discovered a buried talent for the\ngame. Physically, I was like my father. I had natural hand coordination which\nmade delicate tasks come easily — one reason I would soon discover a pastime\nthat lent itself to acts of kibbutz mischief bordering on juvenile delinquency.\nBut when it came to larger muscles, I was hapless, if not hopeless. My prowess\nas a soccer defenseman was because no opposing player in his right mind, once\nI’d inadvertently cut his knees from under him when aiming for the ball, felt it\nwas worth coming anywhere close to me.\n\nBut when the war broke out in earnest in the spring of 1948, my focus, like\nthat of all Israelis, was on the fighting, which even the youngest of us knew\nwould determine whether the state would survive at all. Day after day, my\nfather helped me to chart each major advance and setback on a little map.\nDozens of kibbutzim around the country were in the line of fire. Some had soon\nfallen, while others were barely managing to hang on. Just five miles inland\nfrom us, an Israeli settlement came under attack by an Iraqi force in the nearby\nArab village of Qaqun.\n\nBut inside Mishmar Hasharon, I had the almost surreal feeling that this great\nhistorical drama was something happening everywhere else but on our kibbutz.\nIf it hadn’t been for the radio, or the newsreels which we saw in weekly movie\nnights in the dining hall, and the little map on which I traced its course with my\nfather, I would barely have known a war was going on. One Arab army did get\nnear to us: the Iraqis, in Qaqun. If they had advanced a few miles further, they\ncould have overrun Mishmar Hasharon, reached the coast and cut the new\nJewish state in half. I can still remember the rumble of what sounded like\nthunder one morning in June 1948, as the Alexandronis, one of the twelve\nbrigades in the new Israeli army, launched their decisive attack on the Iraqis.\n\n29\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011500",
