My schedule is already full.”\n- Former US Secretary of State Henry Kissinger\n“Any idiot can face a crisis.

The where, why and what…\nLONG TERM OUTLOOK:\n- Geopolitical events are increasingly pressuring global markets and will continue to do\nso for the remainder of 2015 and well into 2016.\n- Middle East serves as locus for key uncertainty and chaos. We continue to believe the\nregion is at risk of remaining in turmoil for 30+ years .\n- We continue to see NAFTA nations as being seen as economic and political “safe\nhavens” in large part to “Energy Renaissance.”\n- China is going through intense political, economic and societal transformation – all of\nwhich could potentially overwhelm the chances of a successful outcome.\nSHORT TERM (3-10 month) OUTLOOK:\n- In the coming three to six months, three key events will likely happen and have a long\nterm positive impact on markets:\n‣ Approval and implementation of Iran nuclear negotiations\n‣ Congressional approval of Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)\n‣ US will approve repeal ban on export of crude oil/natural gas\nDeutsche Bank\nGlobal Public Affairs\nFrancis J.

It may have\nbeen messy but here is what they have gotten done\nso far this year:\no Trade Promotion Authority (TPA)\no A federal budget\no Iran nuclear deal\no Debt ceiling\no Medicare Payment & CHIP funding\no Homeland Security funding\no Debt ceiling raise\nBut big policy items are unfinished:\no Appropriations (by December 11 th )\no Repealing oil export ban\no Highway bill\no Corporate Tax reform\no The Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP)\nDeutsche Bank\nGlobal Public Affairs\nFrancis J. Kelly\nfrancis.j.kelly@db.com\n3\n11/10/2015 2010 DB Blue template\nUS corporate tax reform: have the seeds been\nplanted and is there a deal to be done?\n- The US Senate has worked on a possible tax\npackage since January. But no clear consensus\nhas emerged on a larger package.\n- The real focus is on corporate tax reform,\nspurred on by the inversion debate.\n- In the Senate, a bipartisan bill was offered to\nencourage corporate profits abroad to repatriate\nat a significantly lower rate (the Portman-\nSchumer bill).\n- In the House, a plan was offered in late July\nthat would allow corporations to repatriate at a\nlower rate if they invested in “research and\ndevelopment” (the Boustany-Neal bill). The\nrevenue from the deal would pay for the\nHighway Trust Fund – which needs money.\n- What is interesting for both bills is what did not\nhappen: The White House remained silent.\n- Could Congress (in league with US Treasury)\nslip a major corporate tax report into the\nappropriations bill using the “Reconciliation”\nprocess?\nDeutsche Bank\nGlobal Public Affairs\nFrancis J. Kelly\nfrancis.j.kelly@db.com\nSource: OMB\n4\n11/10/2015 2010 DB Blue template\nShould hedge funds and private equity funds be\nworried about Washington? No.\n- There continues to be chatter about dealing with carried interest. But chatter does not\nmean action and we see little actual movement toward raising the rates on carried\ninterest through 2016.\n- The new “tax reform” focused on hedge funds is projected to raise $11 billion a year.\nSomehow this gets done by allowing the IRS to audit hedge funds and find this amount\nof unreported revenue annually. Good luck with that.\n- Private Equity has also been a focus of political chatter – maybe we see new regulation\non the burgeoning “Shadow Banking” sector? Again, chatter is not action. There is little\nchance Congress or regulators will move aggressively in this space through 2016.\n- But “Big Banks” continue to take it on the chin: In an effort to raise revenue for the\nHighway Trust Fund, Republicans have legislation moving forward that would drop the\nguaranteed interest rate banks receive for “investing” in the Federal Reserve – which\nthey are required to do by law - from 6 percent to 1.5 percent. This will result in a\nsignificant drop in revenues for some of the biggest banks in the US.\nDeutsche Bank\nGlobal Public Affairs\nFrancis J. Kelly\nfrancis.j.kelly@db.com\n5\n11/10/2015 2010 DB Blue template\nCan US banks get some regulatory relief? Taking care\nof small- and mid-sized banks and reforming the Fed\nSenator Richard Shelby (R-AL), chair of the US Senate Banking Committee, has put forward a\nregulatory relief bill which:\n- Raises the “Systemically Important” bar from $50 billion to $500 billion; Re-define small banks from\n$10 billion to $50 billion;\n- Provides an exemption for banks under $10 billion of assets from the Volcker Rule;\n- Requires the Federal Open Market Committee to release quarterly reports on economic\nconditions around the country, though the Fed chair would still testify before Congress\nsemiannually;\n- Creates an independent commission to evaluate the structure of the Federal Reserve Board\nsystem, including a review of the number and structure of the Fed's 12 districts and requires the\nFederal Reserve to publish a study every two years on its regulation and oversight of nonbanks;\n- Requires the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the Federal Reserve’s regulation of\nsystemically important institutions (SIFIs);\n- Requires the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York to be nominated by the President\nand confirmed by the Senate. Also require3 the Fed to speed up the release of Fed minutes.\nSome observers have suggested this bill will go nowhere; but we would not\nwrite it off so fast. Shelby is the master of the legislative process and there is\nsome bipartisan support already for parts of his bill.\nDeutsche Bank\nGlobal Public Affairs\nFrancis J. Kelly\nfrancis.j.kelly@db.com\n6\n11/10/2015 2010 DB Blue template\nHousing reform: 2015 be the year of GSE reform?\n- After initial movement on bi-partisan legislation last year, this is a dead effort as indicated by\nBanking Committee member and advocate for GSE reform, Senator Bob Corker (R-TN): “Congress\nwill ignore GSE overhaul for next 16 months.”\n- Meanwhile, the housing market is moving on a number of fronts (we’ve seen this horror movie\nbefore):\n�\n�\nFannie Mae launched their “HomeReady Mortgage” program: You can (again) use the income\nfrom non-borrower household members.\nFreddie and Fannie are working on a common Securitization Platform. Just for them (for now)\nbut will eventually allow other participants. Question as to whether this is a transition to\nsomething new or simply securing the monopoly/duopoly of the GSE’s.\nExisting Home Sales\nhas increased 53.9%\nfrom its lowest level of\n3.45 million in July 2010.\nSource: Deutsche Bank\nDeutsche Bank\nGlobal Public Affairs\nFrancis J. Kelly\nfrancis.j.kelly@db.com\n7\n11/10/2015 2010 DB Blue template\nThe “Americas Decades” - The energy revolution\nkeeps moving forward, the implications are enormous\n- The NAFTA Bloc (US, Canada, Mexico) is emerging as a new “Super Bloc” for business,\nfinance and energy.\n- Combined, the NAFTA Bloc is comprised of more than 500 million people, a $19\ntrillion economy and the largest energy capability in the world. Not to mention US\nand Canadian military superiority and reach globally.\n- Mexican government “got it” and amended their constitution; Canada has “gotten it” for\nquite some time (i.e. oil sands, Keystone Pipeline, etc.). US Congress now seeing\nstrategic imperative (not to mention massive federal revenues).\n- The local, national, regional and broader geopolitical implications of greater\nhemispheric energy independence are extraordinary and are already creating significant\npolicy changes – and ruptures globally (i.e. Russia, Middle East, Venezuela, China, Iran).\n‣ Case in point: If the Ukrainian crisis has done anything, it has intensely focused Washington\n(and Mexico City and Ottawa) on the need to rapidly build out natural gas and crude oil\ndevelopment and export capabilities.\n‣ And, in the near future, can tariffs and fees on overseas sales help deal with the US deficit?\nThere are a growing number of members of Congress who think it can. And will.\nDeutsche Bank\nGlobal Public Affairs\nFrancis J.

Big\nobstacle has been overcome: Enough US\nSenators support to ensure it can move\nforward.\n- Saudi Arabia “supports” the deal. The\nSaudi king was in DC last month. US has\nquietly promised nuclear protection and\nmassive weapons sales.\n- Market implications of a deal are\nsignificant, especially for European\ncorporates eager to get back into Iran\nmarketplace (i.e. Italian PM Renzi already\nvisited Tehran as has German FM).\n- Iran wants to build 400 four & five star\nhotels in next five to ten years.\n- But do not expect any significant oil\nexport increase and/or sales into Iran for at\nleast 8 – 10 months.

No and yes\n-The US/EU/NATO toppling of long-time\nstrongman Muammar Gaddafi has led to a\ncycle of instability and continuous violence.\n- It has also led to severe cuts in oil production\nand loss of significant revenue.\n- More importantly, Gaddafi’s massive weapons\nstocks have directly flowed to Boko Haram in\nNigeria, terrorist groups in Mali and to arm\nother movements in Tunisia – as well as\nfinancing them via the sales and trading of\nthese weapons.\n- The US and EU seem to have no strategy to\ndeal with the situation.
