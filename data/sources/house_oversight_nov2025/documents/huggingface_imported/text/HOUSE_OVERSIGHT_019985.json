  "text": "And I’m going to deliver on this.’ ”\n\nAnd then the final, agreed-upon-beforehand question: “Can this Trump movement be\ncombined with what’s happening at CPAC and other conservative movements for fifty\nyears? Can this be brought together ... and is this going to save the country?”\n\n“Well, we have to stick together as a team,” said Priebus. “It’s gonna take all of us\nworking together to make it happen.”\n\nAs Bannon started into his answer, he spoke slowly, looking out at his captive and\nriveted audience: “I’ve said that there is a new political order being formed out of this and\nit’s still being formed. If you look at the wide degree of opinions in this room, whether\nyou are a populist, whether you’re a limited-government conservative, whether you’re a\nlibertarian, whether you’re an economic nationalist, we have wide and sometimes\ndivergent opinions, but I think the center core of what we believe, that we’re a nation with\nan economy, not an economy just in some global market place with open borders, but that\nwe are a nation with a culture, and a reason for being. I think that’s what unites us. And\nthat’s what’s going to unite this movement going forward.”\n\nBannon lowered the microphone to, after what might be interpreted as a beat of\nuncertainty, suddenly thunderous applause.\n\nWatching from the White House, Kushner—who had come to believe that there was\nsomething insidious when Bannon used the words “borders,” “global,” “culture,” and\n“unite,” and who was more and more convinced that they were personally directed against\nhim—was now in a rage.\n\nOOK Ok\n\nKellyanne Conway had increasingly been worrying about the seventy-year-old president’s\nsleeplessness and his worn look. It was the president’s indefatigability—a constant\nrestlessness—that she believed carried the team. On the campaign trail, he would always\nadd stops and speeches. He doubled his own campaign time. Hillary worked at half time;\nhe worked at double time. He sucked in the energy from the crowds. Now that he was\nliving alone in the White House, though, he had seemed to lose a step.\n\nBut today he was back. He had been under the sunlamp and lightened his hair, and\nwhen the climate-change-denying president woke up on another springlike morning, 77\ndegrees in the middle of winter, on the second day of CPAC, he seemed practically a\ndifferent person, or anyway a noticeably younger one. At the appointed hour, to the\nlocked-down ballroom at the Gaylord Resort, filled to capacity with all stripes of the\nconservative faithful—Rebekah Mercer and her daughter up front—and hundreds of\nmedia people in an SRO gallery, the president emerged onto the stage, not in an energetic\ntelevision-style rush, but with a slow swagger to the low strains of “I’m Proud to Be an\nAmerican.” He came to the stage as a political strongman, a man occupying his moment,\nclapping—here he reverted to entertainer pose—as he slowly approached the podium,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019985",
