And the old ones: Hezbollah, Iran,\nterrorism —are all \"alive and kicking\" and\nerowing even stronger.\n\nBut there is good news too. Israel is the\nstrongest country in the region, from\nTripoli in Libya to Tehran. It's the\nstrongest militarily, strategically, and\neconomically, and if we know act\nwisely—diplomatically too. Equally\nimportant: Israel will continue to be the\nstrongest country in the region in the\nforeseeable future — especially if we\nmanage to identify and cultivate these\nsources of empowerment and advantage\n— including:\n\n¢ Armed Forces capable of defeating\nany outside combination of threats,\nincluding terrorism.\n\ne A strong and growing economy in\nan open relationship with global\nmarkets.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028891",
