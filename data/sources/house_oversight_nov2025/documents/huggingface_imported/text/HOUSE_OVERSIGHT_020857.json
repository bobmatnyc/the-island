  "text": "A Word of Warning About Comparing\n\nCorporate & Government Accounting...\n\ne Government accounting standards do not report the present value of future\nentitlement payments (such as Social Security or Medicare) as liabilities.\nInstead, entitlement payments are recognized only when they are paid.\n\nOur analysis takes a different view: governments create liabilities when they\nenact entitlements and do not provide for revenues adequate to fund them.\n\ne We measure the entitlement liability as the present value of estimated\nentitlement payments in excess of expected revenues for citizens of working age\nbased on Social Security and Medicare Trust Funds’ actuarial analysis.\n\ne Government accounting standards also do not recognize the value of internally-\ngenerated intangible assets (such as the sovereign power to tax). We do not\nrecognize those assets either, as we have no basis to measure them. But the\nUS government has substantial intangible assets that should provide future\neconomic benefits.\n\nNote: For more discussion on alternatives to corporate and official government accounting methods, see Laurence J. Kotlikoff, Alan J. Auerbach, and Jagadeesh\nokhale, “Generational Accounting: A Meaningful Way to Assess Generational Policy,” published on 12/94 in The Journal of Economic Perspectives.\n\nKP Source: Greg Jonas, Morgan Stanley Research.\ni USA Inc. | High Level Thoughts 31\n\n...and About Government Budgeting\n\ne Federal government budgeting follows arcane practices that are very different\nfrom corporate budgeting — and can neglect solutions to structural problems in\nfavor of short-term expediency.\n\ne Federal government does not distinguish capital budget (for long-term\ninvestment) from operating budget (for day-to-day operations). As a result, when\nfunding is limited, government may choose to reduce investments for the future\nto preserve resources for day-to-day operations.\n\ne Budget “scoring” rules give Congress incentives to hide the true costs...and help\nCongressional committees defend their turf.”\n\nNote: *For more detail, refer to slide 116 on congressional budget scoring rules related to recent Healthcare reform.\na USA Inc. | High Level Thoughts 32\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020857",
