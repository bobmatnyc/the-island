  "text": "confident. This is a back and forth, a power loop. His\nexpertise is knowing what other people know. Which\nsurely offers a unique sense of confidence that it is\npossible to understand how the world works. And in a\ntime of such radical flux and existential instability,\neverybody wants to seek out someone who might have\nsome answers or at least make you feel like he does—\neven, and maybe especially, the rich. The fact that he’s\nan outsider, even a pariah, nobody you have to fear, in\nhis own way a secret (and all powerful people like\nsecrets) is—if you’re not caught in his company—\nreassuring too.\n\nIn the last days of my interviews with Epstein, he\nwas called by a particular world-stage individual, indeed\namong the richest and most powerful—proudly louche\nhimself—who, feeling out of his depth in a world of\ncrashing oil prices and wild currency fluctuation, had\ncome to believe he might benefit from some private\ntutoring. And so the math teacher got on his plane.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022893",
