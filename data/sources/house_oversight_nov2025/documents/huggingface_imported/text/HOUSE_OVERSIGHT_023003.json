  "text": "Jeffrey Epstein repeatedly engaged in sexual activity with underage girls at his\nwaterfront Palm Beach home on El Brillo Way, according to police in the Town of\nPalm Beach. Epstein also owns residences in New York City and the U.S. Virgin\n\nIslands, among other locales. Emily Michot emichot@miamiherald.com\n\nApril: Palm Beach police begin trash pulls at Epstein’s home, discovering a\ntelephone message for Epstein with the girl’s name on it, and a time that matched\nthe time that she told police she was there. They find the names and phone numbers\nof other girls on message slips in his trash.\n\nOctober: With the police probe in full swing, one of Epstein’s assistants calls one of\nthe girls just as she is being questioned by police. Investigators begin interviewing\nmore girls, as well as Epstein’s butlers, who tell them that Epstein had frequent\nvisits from girls throughout the day. On Oct. 20, they execute a search warrant at his\nhouse on El Brillo Way in Palm Beach.\n\n2006\n\nMay: Police sign a probable cause affidavit charging Epstein and two of his\nassistants with multiple counts of unlawful sex acts with a minor. The Palm Beach\nstate attorney, Barry Krischer, instead refers the case to a grand jury.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023003",
