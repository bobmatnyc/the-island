  "text": "Company Description: Dover is a diversified, global manufacturer of industrial products.\nIt comprises more than 30 independent companies that operate in four segments:\nRefrigeration & Food Equipment, Fluids, Energy, and Engineered Systems.\n\nGeneral Dynamics (GD)\n\nRonald Epstein +1 646 855 5695\nResearch Analyst, MLPF&S\n\nBuy, PO $200\n\n1Q investment thesis\n\nGeneral Dynamics is a defensive large cap value stock with potential cyclical growth.\nThe company has a history of annual dividend increases with a dividend yield of 1.7%.\nConcerns about weakening demand for Gulfstream business jets in General Dynamic’s\nAerospace segment have weighed down sentiment. However, using a sum-of-the-parts\nanalysis that values GD’s defense businesses in line with the pure play defense average,\nthis would imply that GD’s Aerospace segment is trading at a significant discount to the\nmarket at 12x P/E multiple on 2018E earnings. Considering the strength in Gulfstream’s\nproduct portfolio and margin performance, we would expect Aerospace to trade at least\nat 18x P/E multiple on 2018E earnings.\n\nTable 1: General Dynamics key stock data\n\nIndustry Aerospace & Defense\nMarket Cap (mn) $57,215\nPrice $173.21\nP/E (2017)* 17.9x\n% of sell-side rated Buy 76.2%\nShort interest % of float 1.02%\n\nSource: Bloomberg and BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates\n\nGov't Legislation: 56% of sales are from the US government\n\nGeneral Dynamics’ primary customer is the US Department of Defense, which accounted\nfor 47% of total sales in 2015. The remaining 9% are to other non-DoD US government\nagencies like the intelligence community. For the military, which is a defensive sector,\nGD is engaged in engineering, manufacturing, and support of land and expeditionary\ncombat vehicles and systems, armaments, munitions, and shipbuilding and marine\nsystems. Major products include Virginia-class nuclear-powered submarine and Ohio\nclass ballistic nuclear submarine replacement, Arleigh Burke-class Aegis destroyer,\nAbrams M1A2 tank, Stryker 8-wheeled assault vehicle, medium-caliber munitions and\ngun systems, tactical and strategic mission systems. The company also provides\ninformation systems and technologies.\n\nDisruptor: Gulfstream G650 has unrivaled performance in the most profitable\n\nbusiness jet market segment\n\nThere is no direct competitor aircraft currently in service in the market to match the\nperformance of the Gulfstream G650/650ER. The G650ER has a range of 7,500 nautical\nmiles at Mach 0.85, but can fly faster at Mach 0.90 with a range of 6,400 nautical miles.\nThe Dassault Falcon 8X has a range of only 6,450 nautical miles. Meanwhile,\nBombardier’s response to the G650 has been delayed another year with the entry into\nservice of the Global 7000 (range of 7,300 nautical miles) in 2H18. Gulfstream book-to-\nbill in 3Q16 was 1:1 ona dollar value basis and 1.2:1 on an aircraft unit basis. In our\nview, market share gains in a soft demand environment could provide Gulfstream a solid\nfoundation to bridge the Gulfstream G450/550 to the G500/600.\n\nBankof America\nMerrill Lynch\n\nTop 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 5\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014626",
