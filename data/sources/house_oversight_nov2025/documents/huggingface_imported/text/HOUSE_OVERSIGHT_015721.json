Functional MRI scans show intelligent people use more neurons\nwhen tackling a given mental task, perhaps bringing to bear greater raw\nhorsepower, but this is not really an explanation. It is akin to saying Usain\nBolt runs faster because he gets more power to his legs. This is obvious.\nWhat we want to know is how.\n\nThe problem with looking at brains for a common cause is the\nvariation from brain to brain. We all have different genes and life\nexperiences. On top of this, we really only see brains post mortem and\nthis tends to confound comparisons of brain structure. One way to\nminimize the variation is to use separated identical twins. Twins have\nidentical genes so their fundamental hardware is the same. We should be\nable to see features of the brain that are common to smart sets of twins but\nabsent in less smart pairs. If a feature is not shared it can be discounted as\nsomething accidental, caused by disease, environment, or the like.\n\nWhen we examine smart twins, they appear to have greater\nmyelination of their neurons. Myelin is a flat protein that acts as an\ninsulating sheath, wrapping the nerves and the neurons in our brain.\nMyelination appears to be part of the mechanism involved in laying\ndown long-term memory — more myelin, more memories. It may also\nhelp sustain signals and allow them to move faster over a longer distance:\nthe increased insulation allowing the brain to include information from\nmore distant parts of the brain within a given thought. But increased\nmyelination may be an effect of higher intelligence rather than a cause.\nThe brain is responsible for a significant part of our overall energy\nconsumption so insulating the neurons might simply help with energy\nconservation. This is an active area of research.\n\nEvolution also gives a clue to the causes of intelligence. Humans,\nnonhuman primates, and dolphins all share spindle neurons. These\nspread across the brain and appear to help us coordinate complex\nactions between the different parts. The high function intelligence that\ncharacterizes these disparate species requires a great deal of cooperation\nbetween different areas of the brain. Take playing a musical instrument.\nThis uses physical coordination (motor cortex), sound processing\n(auditory cortex), rhythm (another part of the motor cortex), along\nwith emotional interpretation (amygdala). Humans have more spindle\ncells than other animals so this might explain our superior ability in\nperforming these complex tasks.\n\nHowever plausible these ideas, they are all hardware arguments. It\nis like me saying my word processor is better than yours because it has\ngold plated connectors. That might be true — it might allow the machine\nto run a little faster without electrical errors creeping in, but we all know\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015721",
