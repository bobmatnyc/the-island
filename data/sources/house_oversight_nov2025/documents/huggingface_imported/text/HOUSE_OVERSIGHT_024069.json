  "text": "IX. CERTAIN INVESTMENT CONSIDERATIONS\n\nAn investment in the Fund entails a significant degree of risk and, therefore, should be undertaken only\nby investors capable of evaluating the risks of the Fund and bearing the risks it represents. There can be\nno assurance that the Fund's investment objectives will be achieved or that an investor will receive a\nreturn of its capital, and therefore, an investor should only invest in the Fund if such investor is able to\nwithstand a total loss of its investment. In addition, there will be occasions when the General Partner\nand its affiliates may encounter potential conflicts of interest in connection with the Fund. Prospective\ninvestors in the Fund should carefully consider the following factors in connection with an investment in\nthe Fund. The following is not a complete list of all risks involved in connection with an investment in\nthe Fund. In addition to the items discussed below, prospective investors should also consider the\ninformation described in Section XI, “Certain Tax & ERISA Considerations” and elsewhere in this\nMemorandum. Prospective investors are cautioned not to rely on the prior returns set forth in this\nMemorandum in making a decision whether or not to purchase the Limited Partner Interests offered\nhereby. The return information contained in this Memorandum has not been audited or verified by any\nindependent party and should not be considered representative of the returns that may be received by an\ninvestor in the Fund. Past performance is not a guarantee of future results.\n\nRisk of Venture Capital Investments\n\nWhile venture capital investments offer the opportunity for significant gains, such investments\nalso involve a high degree of business and financial risk and can result in substantial losses.\nAmong these risks are the general risks associated with investing in companies at an early state\nof development or with little or no operating history, companies operating at a loss or with\nsubstantial variations in operating results from period to period, and companies with the need\nfor substantial additional capital to support expansion or to achieve or maintain a competitive\nposition. Such companies may face intense competition, including from companies with greater\nfinancial resources, more extensive development, manufacturing, marketing and service\ncapabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel. Due to the\nlimited number of investments that the Fund may make, poor performance by some of the\nFund’s investments could significantly affect the total returns to Limited Partners.\n\nFocused Investment Strategy\n\nThe Fund will be focused on life sciences and healthcare technology investments and may not\nenjoy the reduced risks of a broadly diversified portfolio. A specific investment focus is\ninherently more risky and could cause the Fund’s investments to be more susceptible to\nparticular economic, political, regulatory, technological or industry conditions or occurrences\ncompared with a fund, or a portfolio of funds, that is more diversified or has a broader industry\nfocus.\n\nRisks Associated with Investments in Life Sciences and Healthcare Technology Companies\n\nThe success of the Fund’s portfolio companies may be dependent upon obtaining certain\ngovernmental approvals. Companies in the life sciences and healthcare technology industry\ntypically require the approval of agencies such as the FDA prior to marketing their products to\nthe public. Of particular significance are the FDA requirements covering research and\ndevelopment, testing, manufacturing, quality control, labeling and promotion of drugs for\nhuman use. The approval process is very lengthy and very costly, and there can be no\nguarantee that a portfolio company will obtain the necessary approvals for its products. If a\nportfolio company is unable to obtain these approvals in a timely fashion, the portfolio\n\n58 CONTROL NUMBER 257 - CONFIDENTIAL\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024069",
