Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the backgrounds of his\nyoung accusers.\n\nMr. Lefcourt says that the police acted “outrageously” and that his client has been\nwrongfully dragged through the mud.\n\n“He disputes that he ever had sex with any under-age person or anything like that,” said\nMr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart and Abbie\nHoffman.\n\nNeither the police nor the state attorney’s office would discuss the case in detail. But the\npolice released a thick report on the 13-month investigation after the indictment was\nunsealed in late July.\n\nThe police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately after\nthey were contacted by the stepmother of the 14-year-old, who, according to the report,\nwas in a special school for students with disciplinary problems.\n\nThe girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had “offered her an\nopportunity to make money” and had driven her to Mr. Epstein’s house one Sunday. The\nfriend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college student, told\nthe girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said.\n\nThe girl told the police that Mr. Epstein’s assistant had led her upstairs to a room with a\nmassage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove her clothes. She\nsaid Mr. Epstem had masturbated as she massaged him, had pressed a vibrator against her\nunderwear and had given her $300 afterward.\n\nIn October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr. Epstein had\nroutinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then interviewed a total\nof 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar stories about what they\nhad observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein’s home. According to the report, at least\none said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse with her.\n\nMr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with Mr.\nEpstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown up for\ngrand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie-detector test clearing\nhim of any sexual involvement with under-age girls.\n\nA spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police went to\nMr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.\nInstead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a grand jury to\nexamine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring.\n\nAround that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors to share\ninformation about the accusers, including statements they had posted on MySpace.com,\nthe social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol. According to the report,\nMr. Krischer’s office then decided to delay the grand jury session for several months.\nThe Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May | the department\nasked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.\n\nChief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning “the unusual course that your office’s\nhandling of this matter has taken” and suggesting that Mr. Krischer disqualify himself.\n\nChief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his spokeswoman would not\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030308",
