  "text": "In the winter, when the well-to-do from all over the Northeast visit Florida\nfor charity balls, the board hosts dinners and parties for prospective\nrelocators and local captains of industry. Last year, Smallridge and\ncompany sponsored a soiree aboard a $70 million yacht that featured Veuve\nClicquot, caviar and live jazz. Guests—who included the CEOs of a national\nIT company, a major finance company and a land developer, venture\ncapitalists, hedge fund managers and the creator of Goldman Sachs’ prime\nbrokerage division—took private tours with the captain of the yacht.\n\nSmallridge is also working with former hedge fund CIO Dr. Rainford Knight\nto develop a club for local investment managers called SocialAlpha that\nencourages bankers in Palm Beach County’s ritzy social scene to get to know\neach other. Even Florida governor Rick Scott has gotten involved, sending\npersonal letters to friends and prospects from the Northeast (the governor is\na former Greenwich resident and businessman) to convince them of\nFlorida’s merits.\n\nSmallridge and Governor Scott are hoping to induce a snowball effect, and\nso far, it seems to be working. Every financier who moves south chips away\nat the primary reason to remain near New York City—the fact that everyone\nelse is there. That’s not to say it’s been easy.

The majority of those who have reached the upper\nechelons of financial management are married with children, and the appeal\nof a semi-tropical paradise with luxury restaurants, year-round recreation,\nand sophisticated socializing in a community far more tight-knit than\nManhattan (yes, that’sDonald Trump over there) is not lost on them.\n\nPorter’s tour of Billionaire’s Row was part of a modified version of one of\nthe Business Development Board’s red-carpet tours that I took as part of\nresearching this story. I ate breakfast at the clubby Top of the Point\nrestaurant with some of the area’s prominent financiers.
