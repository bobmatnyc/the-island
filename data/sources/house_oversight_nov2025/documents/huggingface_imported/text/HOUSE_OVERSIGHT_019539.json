By\ndoing so, it “anomizes” each user of the dark side.\n\nBecause of the anonymity it provides, Tor became the software of\nchoice for individuals and organizations who wanted to hide their\nidentities. For example, Tor software made possible Silk Road, which\nacted as an exchange for drug dealers, assassins, safecrackers, and\nprostitutes until it was closed down by the FBI in 2013. It was cre-\nated by Ross Ulbricht, a Libertarian who wore a Ron Paul T-shirt,\nas a website where “people could buy anything anonymously, with\nno trail whatsoever that led back to them.” (Ulbricht received a life\nsentence for running this criminal enterprise in May 2015.)\n\nTor software was also employed by Private Bradley Manning\n(now Chelsea Manning) to transfer some fifty thousand diplomatic\ncables and military reports from his laptop to Assange’s WikiLeaks\nwebsite. Eventually, Manning was identified by a fellow hacker, con-\nvicted by a military court for violations of the Espionage Act, and\nsentenced to thirty-five years in prison. Tor enabled WikiLeaks to\n\n® publish other secret data, such as material acquired in the theft of ©\nSony’s files, allegedly by the North Korean intelligence service, in\n2015. It was the means for guaranteeing anonymity to the IT work-\ners who responded to Assange’s by now famous clarion call to unite.\nIt allowed system administrators who opposed the “surveillance\nstate,” as well as other disgruntled employees of government agen-\ncies or corporations, to send documents they copied to the WikiLeaks\nwebsite without revealing their IP addresses.\n\nBecause WikiLeaks did not know the identity of its sources, it\ncould not be legally compelled to reveal them. “Tor’s importance\nto WikiLeaks cannot be overstated,” Assange said in an interview\nwith Rolling Stone in 2012. Indeed, without the anonymity provided\nby its Tor software, WikiLeaks could not have easily entered into a\ndocument-sharing arrangement with major newspapers, including\nThe Guardian, The New York Times, Der Spiegel, Le Monde, and El\nPats. Through the magic of Tor, these newspapers simply attribute\ntheir sources to WikiLeaks, which, in turn, made Assange a major\nforce in international journalism.\n\nIronically, Tor was a creation of U.S. intelligence.
