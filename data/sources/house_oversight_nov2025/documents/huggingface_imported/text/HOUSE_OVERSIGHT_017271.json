Her father had\nbeen convicted of killing her mother by injecting her with a drug that stops the heart from\nworking. He was sentenced to life imprisonment. “It’s just like the Von Bulow case,” the\ndaughter insisted. “My father didn’t kill my mother. He didn’t inject anything into her. She died\nof natural causes.” (No one seeking my help ever tells me their case is “just like” O.J.\nSimpson’s! )\n\nWhen the daughter of an alleged murder victim is so certain the defendant is innocent, even when\nthe defendant is her father, the case is certainly worthy of a hard second look. I agreed to provide\nthat look and to argue the appeal—and a possible new trial motion—if I concluded there had been\na possible injustice.\n\nMy initial review of the evidence was not encouraging. There were needle marks on the victim’s\narm that were consistent with an injection. Moreover, a subsequent lab test had revealed traces of\nthe metabolite of a drug called succinylcholine—a paralytic agent capable of stopping the heart.\nFinally, the defendant was having an affair, and he was a medical doctor—indeed the medical\nexaminer of his Florida county—and thus had the motive and knowledge necessary to stop his\nwife’s heart. All the classic components for homicide—motive, opportunity, means and scientific\nevidence—were present, and they pointed in the direction of guilt. I could easily understand why\na jury could convict. In these respects, it was like the Von Bulow and Simpson cases, but in the\nVon Bulow case, the evidence, upon reexamination, pointed to innocence, and in the Simpson\ncase, a major item of evidence—the bloody sock—had been planted by the police. There seemed\nto be no such elements of doubt here. At least not yet.\n\nThe Sybers case had begun more than a decade before I was called. Kay Sybers had died\nsuddenly in her sleep—or so it appeared—on May 30, 1991. She was 52 years old and in\ngenerally good health, though she had suffered from allergies for which she took medication. An\nautopsy was performed but no cause of death could be determined. One of the investigators did,\nhowever, think she saw a needle mark. The original death certificate read: “sudden unexpected\ndeath due to undetermined natural causes.”\n\nRumors immediately began to circulate that Dr. Sybers was having an affair with a lab technician,\nand an investigation was begun. An investigator was dispatched to the Sybers home and the\ngrieving husband was asked to describe his wife’s last night. Dr. Sybers told the investigator that\nat about 4AM his wife awoke with chest pains. She had taken some medication, so Dr. Sybers\ndecided to draw some blood to give to her doctor the next day. He did not succeed in drawing\nthe blood and he threw the syringe into the garbage. The syringe could not be found because the\ntrash had already been collected. This all seemed very suspicious and so the investigation\ncontinued. After more than a year-long investigation, the State Attorney reported that he had\nfound “no prosecutable case,” and that there was no physical evidence that Dr. Sybers had killed\nhis wife. The case was closed—or so it seemed.\n\nBut nearly two years after Kay’s death, and a year after the case against Bill was closed, their 27\nyear old son Tim killed himself on his mother’s birthday. Shortly before he shot himself, Tim was\n\n184\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017271",
