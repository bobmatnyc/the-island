  "text": "for loneliness or perceived social\nisolation. Because they believe\nthemselves to be creatures of God,\nChristians feel related to God whatever\nhappens. Whatever their social\ncircumstances--no matter, at the\nextreme, how isolated or strong their\nfeelings of abandonment by human\nothers--individuals are to remember that\nthey remain in a relationship with God,\nwho is concerned about them. Even\nwhen they feel themselves utterly\nforsaken by others, Christians have\nreason to believe God cannot be\nforsaking them. They can believe they\nare never alone even when they appear\nto be absolutely so. In such\ncircumstances, Christians can always\navail themselves of a completely\ncounterfactual sense of social connection\nwith the best-connected “superfriend” of\nall—the God who remains, they believe,\nin a relationship of ultimately beneficial\ncausal efficacy with not just themselves\nbut everyone and everything.\n\nIt is the very unapparent,\ncounterfactual character of God’s\ninfluence on human lives—the\ninvisibility of God’s influence, in short--\nthat permits Christians to perceive their\nrelationship with God as an unbreakable\nconstant. Because God’s influence is\nunapparent or invisible Christians can\ncontinue to believe God is operative for\ncreation’s benefit in the absence of any\nof the obvious confirming evidence\nrequired in ordinary cases of beneficent\nhuman influence. Christians who believe\nthat God is a universal influence for\ngood as the world’s creator do not\nexpect God to be present in the way one\nexpects a human person to be; and\ntherefore God’s apparent absence, in\nhuman terms, need not break down their\nsense of being in relation to God.\n\n123\n\nPage\n\nHaving God as one’s creator (in\nthe best case scenario) is like having a\nperfectly loving human benefactor; but it\nis the unusual invisibility of this\nbenefactor that allows Christians to think\nGod present even when not apparently\nso. Being in a relationship with God for\nChristians who believe God is a good\ncreator is something like being in a\nrelationship with a human person who\nnever lets one out of her sight and who\nintends one’s good comprehensively. It\nis, for example, very like being ina\nrelationship with a loving parent who is\nfully responsible, not just for the fact of\none’s existence, but in a comprehensive\nway for one’s nurturance throughout an\nextended minority. Unlike a relationship\nwith an ordinary human person of that\nsort, however, God is believed to be\ninvisible and this is what allows\nindividuals to assume God’s constant\npresence, all appearances to the contrary.\n\nThe invisibility that underlies the\nChristian affirmation of God’s constancy\nhere is a function of the very diffuseness\nof God’s influence, a diffuseness of\ninfluence no human person, invisible or\notherwise, could possibly match. Belief\nin God as the creator of the world does\nnot encourage one to single out God as\nthe cause of any specific happening in a\nway that suggests God is one cause\namong many, the cause of this particular\nhappening rather than some other with a\ndifferent cause. Belief in God as the\ncreator of the world does not allow one\nto identify God’s influence in overly\nclose fashion with any particular causal\ninfluence of a beneficent sort. Instead, as\nI have suggested, whatever is of benefit\nto the individual, over the long or short\nterm, taken as a whole, is to be attributed\nto God’s influence.\n\nThe Christian cannot, then, locate\nor pick out God as one could a loving\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021369",
