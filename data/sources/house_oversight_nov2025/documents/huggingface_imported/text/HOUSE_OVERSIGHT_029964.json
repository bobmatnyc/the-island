  "text": "imagine the first congressional hearings on Bitcoin being a prelude to a federal crackdown on the\ndecentralized financial network.\n\nBut that's not what happened. Instead, the hearings were lovefests. All three Obama administration\nofficials who testified this week stressed that Bitcoin has legitimate uses and argued that no new\nregulations were needed to police illicit uses of the network. Most of the other witnesses echoed those\nsentiments.\n\nThat wasn't a coincidence. The cordial atmosphere of this week's hearings was the culmination of\nmonths of careful diplomacy by Bitcoin advocates. Since the spring, leaders of the Bitcoin community\nand sympathetic policy advocates have been engaging with federal regulators, lawmakers and other\ninfluential figures inside the beltway. The result: a near-unanimous consensus that the federal\ngovernment needs to be careful to avoid hampering the growth of the world's first completely\ndecentralized payment network.\n\nA tough crowd\n\nOn the morning of June 13, several dozen well-dressed Washingtonians filed into the Carlucci\nAuditorium at the stately headquarters of the United States Institute of Peace. For many of the\ngovernment officials in the room, this would be their first opportunity to meet senior figures in the\nBitcoin community in the flesh. Panelists included lead Bitcoin developer Gavin Andressen and\nPatrick Murck, general counsel of the Bitcoin Foundation.\n\nThe way the event was framed didn't augur well for Bitcoin. One of the conference's two sponsors\n(along with Thompson Reuters) was the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children. A\nmajor theme of the second panel was the use of bitcoins to purchase child pornography.\n\n\"Child pornography is like Bitcoin in some ways,\" said Andrew Oosterbaan, who prosecutes child\npornography cases for the Justice Department. \"It has intrinsic value to people who want it. The more\nvaluable child pornography is the new child pornography. When you add an anonymous currency,\nyou've taken individuals who are already incentivized to produce, given them a far more meaningful\nincentive to do so.\"\n\n\"Bitcoin is nothing like child pornography,\" a visibly angry Murck shot back. \"If there was one\ninstance of a child being abused because of Bitcoin, that's one too many. I'm a father, I think there's a\nspecial place in hell for people who do that.\"\n\nBut Murck also stressed that the Bitcoin community was willing to work with federal regulators to\nensure that Bitcoin-based businesses complied with applicable laws. \"I want to craft a sane regulatory\nenvironment,\" he said, urging federal regulators to \"engage stakeholders. Don't have secret meetings.\nHave public meetings. We're all happy to live with the consequences of whatever rulemaking is open\nand transparent.”\n\nMurck would get his wish for engagement, though many of the meetings would be held behind closed\n\ndoors. \"We always intended that conference to be a launching point,\" says Ernie Allen, the president\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029964",
