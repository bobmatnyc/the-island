I then accompanied CSEU\ntech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once\nthis was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house\nwith Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant.\n\nWe began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a\nHarley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage.\nNothing of evidentiary value was located.\n\nWe then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east\nside. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets.\nNothing of evidentiary value was obtained.\n\nA small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath\narea I located a phone message book with recent messages. This item\nwas seized as evidence. Please note this bath and shower area are not\nused as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items\nto include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items.\n\nWe then searched a bath area and closet at the base of the main\nStairs in the foyer. Inside the closet two massage tables were\nlocated as well as partial nude female photographs. These items were\nlater seized as evidence. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted in\nthe bathroom.\n\nWe then searched two bedrooms upstairs on the east side of the\nresidence. Located in the bath room of the south bedroom was penis\nshaped soap. Located in the bedroom of the northern bedroom was penis\nand vagina shaped soap as well as an adult sex toy. These items were\nseized as evidence.\n\nWe then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner\nof the-property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as\nevidence.\n\nI was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was\nDouglas Schoettle. Mr. Schoettle was in the residence at the\nbeginning of the search warrant. He was present during the warrant\nservice and subsequent search. I stood by with him until the search\nwas completed and I departed the residence. I had no conversation\nwith him regarding the reason for our presence.\n\nRegarding seized evidence, all items were photographed in place\nand then collected by CSEU personnel.\n\nThis concludes my involvement in this case.\n\n— -- : ~ HOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019015",
