THIS E-MAIL IS NOT TO BE DISTRIBUTED OR GIVEN TO\nANYONE. If you want to copy Tim on an e-mail, please use the BCC field, so that it remains\nprivate.\n\nMark anyone from Princeton for me to look at (TIM label). [Note: I’ve since had to modify this\ndue to volume. |\n\nIf I decline someone and they persist, give them one more reply —“Tim appreciates the persistence,\nbut he really can’t...” etc.—and then archive future requests. Use your judgment, of course, but\nthat’s the general rule. Some people don’t know when persistent turns into plain irritating.\n\nPlease also create a rule to respond with “scheduled” for all items I send to be put in the calendar\n(when they’re put in the calendar). Missing calendar items can cause big problems, so this is a\ncheck and balance to confirm.\n\nNo need to follow up with someone after a call has taken place unless Tim instructs otherwise, or\nthey request something from us.\n\nSend all speaking requests to XX XX and ensure that he confirms receipt. (However, also see items\n38 and 39).\n\nForeign language requests (i.e., purchasing rights, if the book is available in a particular language,\netc.) send to [the appropriate person at my publisher].\n\nXXXX’s replacement at Random House is XXXX.\nInquire with Tim first before booking any speaking gigs on a specific date, as he may be traveling.\n\nWhen booking appointments in the calendar, be sure to also ask which topics they would like to\ndiscuss, and put them in the calendar description for Tim so he can prepare. Also be sure to ask for\na backup phone number in case they are not able to reach Tim. [I almost always have people call\nme unless I am abroad, as this is another safeguard against missing appointments. ]\n\nPut initials in the subject line of calendar events so we know who (which virtual assistant) put the\nitem in the calendar.\n\nPrepare inquiries for Tim before sending to him for his review, i.e., get their Alexa ranking,\npossible dates of the event, a link to past events they have held, their budget, other confirmed\nspeakers, etc. Then send this info to Tim for his review.\n\nRespond to PX Method inquiries with the following response:\nHi [name],\n\nThanks for your inquiry about the PX Method, however the PX Method page is designed as just\na template others can look at as a reference for testing their own product ideas.\n\nWe are not sure if or when Tim will offer the PX Method for sale, but there are no plans at this\ntime. We appreciate your inquiry nonetheless. Thanks!\n\n[I get quite a few e-mails from readers who do not see the disclaimer on the PX Method mock-\nup page and thus attempt to order a product that isn’t ready to ship.]\n\nDownload eFAX viewer to view Tim’s faxes. His fax number is: XXXX.\nEvent or speaking inquiries can be responded to as such:\n\nThanks for your e-mail and for your invitation to Tim. In looking at the event online, I see that\nthe event is April X and X, 20XX in Portland, Oregon [for example]. Before I present this to Tim,\ncould you answer a few questions for me, so we can make a more informed decision?\n\no » Would you like Tim to be at the entire event?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014012",
