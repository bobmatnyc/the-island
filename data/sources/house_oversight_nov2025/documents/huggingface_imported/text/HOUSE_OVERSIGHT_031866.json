  "text": "33\n\nof the Eastern Hemisphere. A European power trying to dominate the\nMediterranean or expand eastward, an eastern power trying to\ndominate the space between the Hindu Kush and the Mediterranean,\na North African power moving toward the east, or a northern power\nmoving south — all must converge on the eastern coast of the\nMediterranean and therefore on Israel. Of these, the European power\nand the eastern power must be the most concerned with Israel. For\neither, there is no choice but to secure it as an anchor.\n\nInternal Geopolitics\n\nIsrael is geographically divided into three regions, which traditionally\nhave produced three different types of people. Its coastal plain\nfacilitates commerce, serving as the interface between eastern trade\nroutes and the sea. It is the home of merchants and manufacturers,\ncosmopolitans — not as cosmopolitan as Phoenicia or Lebanon, but\ncosmopolitan for Israel. The northeast is hill country, closest to the\nunruliness north of the Litani River and to the Syrian threat. It breeds\nfarmers and warriors. The area south of Jerusalem is hard desert\ncountry, more conducive to herdsman and warriors than anything\nelse. Jerusalem is where these three regions are balanced and\ngoverned.\n\nThere are obviously deep differences built into Israel's geography and\ninhabitants, particularly between the herdsmen of the southern deserts\nand the northern hill dwellers. The coastal dwellers, rich but less\nwarlike than the others, hold the balance or are the prize to be\npursued. In the division of the original kingdom between Israel and\nJudea, we saw the alliance of the coast with the Galilee, while\nJerusalem was held by the desert dwellers. The consequence of the\ndivision was that Israel in the north ultimately was conquered by\nAssyrians from the northeast, while Babylon was able to swallow\nJudea.\n\nSocial divisions in Israel obviously do not have to follow\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031866",
