Lowe Davis, Editor At Large\nLisa Jamil, Advertising Director\nJuanita Young, Controller\n\non Magens Bay Road?\nIs it how fast you can run?\n\nWhat do the new Magen Bay\nsigns mean?\n\nPublic Works installed four of\nthese signs on Magens Bay Road in\nNovember in response to the speed-\ning problem.\n\nAccording to the Merriam-Web-\nster dictionary the abbreviation of\nmiles per hour is “mph” and there\nshould be a number in front of mph\ndesignating the speed. On these\nsigns, the number is omitted, so\n\nLori Emery\n\ndrivers have no idea what the speed\nlimit is.\n\nSt. Thomas is an international\ndestination, and we have contem-\nporary street signs that use symbols\nfor walkers, joggers, bicycles etc. I\nknow we can do better in the signage\ndepartment on Magens Bay Road.\n\n— Lori Emery, St. Thomas\n\nSee Your Views In Print\n\nThe Daily News is always interested in publishing local views on topics of\ngeneral interest, and we especially welcome commentary on issues affecting\nthe Virgin Islands and its people, culture, businesses and government.\nSend Letters, Essays, Halos and Pitchforks, Cartoons\nor other original material about local issues of general interest to\n\nletters@dailynews.vi\nThe Daily News’ opinions are expressed only in its editorials.\nThe opinions expressed in columns, letters, cartoons and\nguest editorials are those of the particular author or artist.\n\nOPINIONS\n\nTuesday, December 13, 2016\n\nWhere will Trump venture\nfor his first state visit?\n\nBarbara Streisand and Lena Dun-\nham may be some of the higher profile\nTrumpfugees leaving the country and\nheading to Justin Trudeau’s Canada.\nWhat is less certain is if a President\nDonald Trump will make Ottawa his\nfirst foreign port of call — a long-\nstanding presidential and foreign policy\ntradition.\n\nPost-election, Trudeau quickly\ncalled to congratulate PEOTUS Trump\non his victory and the Canadian tweet-\ned, “(W)e agreed to meet soon to keep\nbuilding the Canada-US relationship.”\n\nTrump may want to use the high-\nvisibility first trip to do something\nother than affirm tradition and reflect\nthe importance and strength of US.-\nCanadian ties. He may want to make\na grand strategy statement, letting the\nworld know that he is going to shake-\nup the global status quo.\n\nCalls to Taiwan, support for the Phil-\nippines President Rodrigo Duterte and\nmeeting with Japan’s Shinzo Abe have\nalready shaken up the foreign policy\nestablishment's rules for protocol, as\nwell as approaches to human rights and\nglobal power relations. All this well-\nbefore Trump has even been sworn-in.\n\nOnce in office, Ronald Reagan be-\ngan the tradition of new U.S. presidents\nmaking Canada the first foreign presi-\ndential visit. George W. Bush notably\nbroke from this tradition, making his\nfirst stop Mexico, a country he knew\nwell. He also hoped his trip and Cinco\nde Mayo parties on the White House\nlawn would attract Latino voters to the\nRepublican Party.\n\nTrump has already been to Mexico,\nmet with President Pena Nieto, got-\nten a great presidential photo-op and\nmade his talking points. It is unlikely\nhe will be heading south of the border\nfirst.\n\nMaking a splash abroad will likely\nrequire a large rally — similar or bigger\nthan candidate Barack Obama’s visit to\nBerlin in the summer of 2008 — and\nmay be chosen based on the right mix\nof pomp, circumstance, strategy and\nsignificance.\n\nIf two big border nations are knocked\n\nREMEMBER WHEN WE REVERED\nAMERICANS WHo HAD THE\nRIGHT STUFF?\n\nMarkos Kounalakis\n\nout of the running for the primary re-\nception of America’s new head of state,\nwhere might he go first?\n\nThere are any number of early sup-\nporters in other countries who could be\nrewarded and elevated by a presidential\nvisit. The scramble to send invitations\nto Trump Tower has already begun.\n\nUK. Prime Minister Theresa May\nis considering an invitation on behalf\nof Queen Elizabeth II. Trump’s friend-\nship with and preference for Brexit\nleader Nigel Farage as Britain’s next\ndiplomatic envoy will require Trump to\nbalance Buckingham Palace pageantry,\nthe “‘special relationship,” Brexit forces\nand a potentially restive urban populace\nbefore deciding to touch down in Lon-\ndon Town.\n\nNumerous foreign leaders supported\nTrump’s candidacy early on, mostly\nopposition politicians. A few, however,\nare running countries. They include\nHungary’s Viktor Orban, North Ko-\nrea’s Kim Jong Un, Zimbabwe’s Rob-\nert Mugabe and, of course, Russia’s\nVladimir Putin. Rewarding them with\nan American inaugural visit would be\nrevolutionary and could set in motion\n\ndramatic changes in how America’s\nglobal relations, alliances and power\nbalancing is perceived and conducted.\n\nBig, bold, groundbreaking unprec-\nedented moves were the hallmark of\nTrump’s campaign: Is there a reason\nto believe he would take a different ap-\nproach to governing? Trump’s brand of\npolitics is proudly unconventional —\nfrom his brand management business\nto his Fifth Avenue transition tower to\nhis tweet-centric campaign.\n\nWhere will he go? Japan, Russia,\nChina, Italy, Germany, France — may-\nbe even India, Australia or Argentina?\nTipping favor toward any of the G8\nmember countries other than Canada\nfor a “first visit” would create both\nnew foreign policy opportunities and\nchallenges.\n\nTo avoid granting any nation the\nfavor of a first foray, however, he may\ndecide never to leave the country at all,\nrequiring all foreign leaders visit him at\nTrump Tower, Mar-a-Lago, the Trump\nNational Golf Club Bedminster ... or\nmaybe even the White House.\n\n— Markos Kounalakis is a\nsenior fellow at Central European\nUniversity and visiting fellow at the\nHoover Institution. Contact him at\nmarkos@stanford.edu\n\nEmployers should not impose\nreligious views on employees\n\nIn my opinion, Philadelphia Arch-\nbishop Charles Chaput is wrong in\nhis view that religious liberty in the\nUnited States is under attack (Phila-\ndelphia Inquirer and Philly.com, Dec.\n8, 2016).\n\nReligious institutions are free to\nbelieve and preach whatever they\nwant. I think that what they are not\nfree to do is impose those beliefs on\ntheir employees.\n\nFor example, a Catholic-affiliated\n\nRichard Carroll\n\norganization may believe that contra-\nception is immoral, but I don’t think\nthat organization should be allowed\nto block its female employees, who\nmay or may not be Catholic, from\naccess to contraception through its\nmedical insurance plans.\n\nI worked for a Catholic organiza-\ntion (the Knights of Columbus) for\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014509\n\n30 years. Its 600 employees — most\nof whom were non-Catholic women\n— had access to contraceptive cover-\nage through the employer-provided\nhealth plan.\n\nFreedom of religion means free-\ndom not to have your employer’s\nreligious views imposed on you.\n\n— Richard Carroll, a part-time\nSt. Thomas resident, is the former\nAssociate General Counsel of the\nKnights of Columbus",
