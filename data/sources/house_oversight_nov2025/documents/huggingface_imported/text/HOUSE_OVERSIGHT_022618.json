When evaluating the pervasiveness of wrongdoing\nwithin the corporation, prosecutors are advised that while it may be\nappropriate to charge a corporation for minor misconduct where the\nwrongdoing was pervasive, “it may not be appropriate to impose liability\nupon a corporation, particularly one with a robust compliance program in\nplace, under a strict respondeat superior theory for the single isolated act\nof a rogue employee.” /d. § 9-28.500.A (emphasis added), Prosecutors\nshould also consider a company’s compliance program when examining\nany remedial actions taken, including efforts to implement an effective\ncompliance program or to improve an existing one. As the commentary\nexplains, “although the inadequacy ofa corporate compliance program is\na factor to consider when deciding whether to charge a corporation, that\ncorporation’s quick recognition of the flaws in the program and its efforts\nto improve the program are also factors to consider as to appropriate\ndisposition ofa case.” Id. § 9-28.900.B. Finally, the Principles of Federal\nProsecution of Business Organizations provides that prosecutors should\nconsider the existence and effectiveness of the corporation's pre-existing\ncompliance program in determining how to treat a corporate target.
