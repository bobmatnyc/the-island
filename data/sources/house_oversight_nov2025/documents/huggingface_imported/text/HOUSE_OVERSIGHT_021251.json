A mere 300 years\nago, theology and philosophy were the\nprincipal disciplinary lenses through\nwhich the world was viewed, and from\nwhich explanations and instruction were\nsought. Advances in science over the\npast 300 years have transformed how we\nthink, act, and live. Nearly every aspect\nof human existence, ranging from\nagriculture, commerce, and\ntransportation to technology,\ncommunication, and medicine, has been\ntransformed by contemporary science.\nWe have no hesitation to accept\nscientific explanations of physical\nentities being influenced by invisible\nforces such as gravity, magnetism, and\ngenes. But when human mentation and\nbehavior are the objects to be explained,\ndeterministic scientific accounts seem to\nmany to be less satisfying.\n\nPage |5\n\nFor some, science and modernity\nare akin to the apple in the Garden of\nEden, responsible for our fall from\nGrace. For others, theology and religion\nrepresent little more than the stuff of\nsuperstition with no place in an educated\nsociety.\n\nAbout six years ago, we had the\nopportunity to create a most unusual\ngroup of scholars to examine questions\nabout the invisible forces acting on,\nwithin, and between human bodies.\nSuperb scholars who individually had\nmade major contributions to their own\ndisciplinary field — fields as divergent as\nneuroscience and medicine to\nphilosophy and theology — were invited\nto form an interdisciplinary network of\nscholars to consider such questions. The\ndevelopment of these discussions even\nover the first few meetings truly\nastonished us all. We decided to share\nwhat we learned through the present\nbook, which represents a different\nperspective, one in which our\nunderstanding of human nature is\nenriched by serious insights and scrutiny\nthat each perspective has to offer.\nTheology and religion have always\nrelied on unseen forces as the basis for\nexplanations of human behavior and\nexperience. Science has been able to\nexplicate those forces even if along\ndifferent lines than originally conceived.\nAs we start to consider some of the more\ncomplex aspects of human nature,\nscience and theology may be able to\nwork together to shed light on some of\nthese complexities.\n\nWe begin this preface and each\nchapter with a word cloud produced\nusing Wordle at http://www.wordle.net.\nIn the case of this preface, it illustrates\nkey concepts that are found in this book.\nIn the case of the chapters, the word\ncloud in each provides a visualization of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021251",
