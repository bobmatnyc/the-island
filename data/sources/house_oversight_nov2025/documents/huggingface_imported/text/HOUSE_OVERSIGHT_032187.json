The\ncountry could add up to 300,000 barrels this year, with more\ncontracts, more exploration and more drilling already in the works.\nBarring an unlikely and total implosion of the government, it is hard\nto see production slowing down this decade. The same is true for\n“tight oil” coming from unconventional sources. We are seeing this\nbegin to play out in North American fields such as the Bakken in\nNorth Dakota. As technology and investment are dispersed over the\ncoming year, oil supply should positively surprise. Third, Saudi\nsupply increases are not dependant on Opec. The country’s oil\nminister Ali Naimi left the cartel’s Vienna meeting earlier this month\nwith complaints that the organisation had just endured one of its most\ncontentious and least productive gatherings in many years. But that is\nonly because the major oil players were not prepared to pretend that\nthere was agreement on output quotas. With Iran chairing the\nmeeting, an annoyed Venezuela in attendance and an embattled Libya\nlooking on, it was much harder to get the group to put aside their\ndifferences and smile for the cameras. The Saudis have the most\ninfluence on price-moving output decisions and they increased\nproduction just as they had planned before the meeting proved so\ndifficult. Economically stressed oil producers such as Iran and\nVenezuela always want higher oil prices. But the Saudis and other\nGulf Co-operation Council producers maintain a longer-term\nmoderating outlook and they are the ones with the spare capacity to\nmake the difference. Add that to your favourite economist’s\nprojection on the softness of the global economy, and we may soon\nbe asking whether or not this latest IEA move was worth it.\n\nThe writer is the president of Eurasia Group, a political risk\nconsultancy, and author of ‘The End of the Free Market’.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_032187",
