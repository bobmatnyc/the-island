  "text": "1549, and various volunteers and\nagencies offered medical assistance.\nThese rescue efforts were not motivated\nby personal or commercial self-interests,\nand none of the commercial vessel\ncaptains was lauded as a hero. Their\nefforts received less attention because\ntheir actions were precisely what we\nexpect of one another.\n\nIt is the unusual, not the\ncommonplace, that is noticed. On\nMarch 13, 1964, Kitty Genovese parked\nnear her home in Kew Gardens, New\nYork, and proceeded to her residence in\na small apartment complex. Winston\nMoseley, a business machine operator\nwho later confessed that his motive was\nsimply to kill a woman, overtook\nGenovese and stabbed her twice in the\nback. Genovese screamed, “Oh my\nGod, he stabbed me! Help me!”, a call\nthat was heard by neighbors. When one\nneighbor shouted at the attacker, “Leave\nthat girl alone,’ Moseley ran away.\nGenovese, who was wounded and\nbleeding, moved toward the apartment\nbuilding slowly and alone. Moseley\nreturned approximately 10 minutes later\nand searched for Genovese. Finding her\nnearly unconscious in a hallway of the\nbuilding, he continued his knife attack\non her and sexually assaulted her. The\nentire attack unfolded over about half an\nhour, and yet no one responded. The\nfirst clear call for help to the police did\nnot occur until minutes following the\nfinal attack, and Genovese died in an\nambulance en route to the hospital. The\nnumber of people who were aware of\nsome aspect of the attack was estimated\nto be from a dozen to more than three\ndozen. One unidentified neighbor who\nsaw part of the attack was quoted in a\nNew York Times article as saying “T\ndidn’t want to get involved.” (/9). The\nnotion that people might not go to the\n\nPage |24\n\naid of another, even a stranger, in dire\nneed led to public outrage. Decades of\nresearch led to the conclusion that the\nambiguity of the situation and the\ndiffusion of responsibility were\ncontributing factors.\n\nThese two news stories illustrate,\nin very different ways, how invisible\nforces sculpted by evolution and\ncultivated by the environment act on our\nspecies. When commercial boat captains\nact against their own financial interests\nto rescue others on a sinking aircraft, we\nthink nothing of it because we believe it\nis what any individual in the same\nsituation would naturally do. When\nobservers of a brutal attack do nothing to\naid the victim, we are horrified because\nwe believe it goes against who we are as\na species. Humans are not motivated\nsolely by self interests but rather we\nwork together and help one another\nwhen in need. We survive and prosper\nin the long term through collective\nconcerns and actions, not by solely\nselfish pursuits (20).\n\nDanger Signals\n\nThe stories of the sardine ball\nand the penguin huddle suggest that it is\ndangerous to be on the social perimeter.\nLiving on the perimeter threatens the\nlives and genetic legacy of humans, as\nwell. Epidemiological studies have\nfound that social isolation is not only\nassociated with lower levels of\nhappiness and well being but with broad\nbased morbidity and mortality (2/).\nMoreover, humans are such meaning-\nmaking creatures that perceived social\nisolation is at least as important a\npredictor of adverse outcomes on human\nhealth and well being as is objective\nsocial isolation (22). Writers may spend\nlong periods by themselves, but the\nenvisioned readers make this time feel\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021270",
