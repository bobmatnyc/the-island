  "text": "can do it. I will have no real further involvement apart from confirming the outcome of my proposed\n\nstructure, I will not risk the admonition of- they thought you said, they thought you meant, they understood it\nto be. but they said you said, (ie,I asked at our meeting that accounting be done properly for bens house ,\nwhat came back was ada thought that I meant that we needed to go back to the 97 trust and give him a full third\nparty accounting of where his money had gone??!! I kid you not). I dont think brad should talk to jane heller\nwithout a fully fleshed out plan in place and even then it should be you.\n\nDate: Mon, Nov 30, 2015 at 11:21 AM\n\nSubject: agenda\n\nTo: Melanie Spinella|\n\n1 fees, amount and to what entities when and responsiblitis. 2. gagosian idea to save a minimum of 10\nmill and maybe more. 3. ican walk you through carlyns screw up, 50 % would have made little difference\nand maybe made it worse. 4. we should have an all hands meeting with your family to talk about art\ndistribution on death. . 5. phaidon, decantings ( already firmly in progress ) loans. (alan ) pent. ( with\nfollow up ) all part of same elegant transaction, 6 asymetric risk worth at least 50- 60 no matter how you\ncalculate. Ican explain. 7 lets get the money issue out of the way once and for all. I have my team set to\nstart.\n\nDate: Fri, Dec 4, 2015 at 8:07 AM\nSubject: Fwd: moving forward\nTo: Melanie Spinella\nThad forgotten that Alan was actually at the table when i explained my note deal to you. _ it was at the end of\nthe meeting described below. . as you will recall , not once , not even a peep did alan suggest\ncontemporaneously his hand in the crafting, in fact brad said it was an idea. that HE brad, HAD HAD, from\nthe begiining . my emails between alan and I that you can read , further confirm authorship. Im sure you recall\nthe obnoxious tooting when alan said he agreed with my plan. .\n\nDate: Mon, Nov 2, 2015 at 10:03 PM\n\nSubject: moving forward\n\nTo: Melanie Spinclla 3 7\n\nI have mixed emotions about what transpired today. really, You saw first hand in nauseating detail what i\nhave been saying to you for quite a while now. _Joslins answers were totally incomprehensible. the charts he\nprepared unreadable. Brads defensive posture was at a minum very surprising . He and I have recently gotten\nalong quite well , thought. Neither Joslin or Brad understood a 180 million dollar number . no cash flow\nafter weeks of requesting? odd. when you suggested that heathers behavior was emblematic of a sloppy\noffice , brad said lets not talk about emblems??! bill pay , admittedly no change for the year. . plane not\ndone. though it was the only thing i suggested doing first in july. . I sent you a list of 10 consultantts. brad said\nthree, . 1 didnt want to push it. I was shocked that brad was opining on things he knows little or nothing\nabout. tax issues. 1031. neg basis , note payoffs ( the same idea he said he had had from the beggining??!!)\n. answers re LBF holdings that can be corrected (they cant) . valuations that have never been read. . When\nwe met in your lobby he seems surprised that 1 was there. I dont know if he felt somewhat sandbagged. ..\n\nthe savings on the note payoff is aprrox 33 % of 1.8 billion. real money if you do phaidon which i see no\nreason not to . if later josh and ben want to buy it back with you or without you they can. i will walk you\nthrough the structure one on one. . the losses will offeset the calder gain as well as apollo gain.\n\nIm aware that seeing what you saw frustrated you. I felt badly for you.\n\nYou wanted a contingent deal. real value. etc. I will not of course hold you to your deal .. its silly. its not\nhow i work or a reflection of our friendship. my proposal is as follows. I want away from your buisiness , but\nat the same time leaving you in good shape. __I think you should pay the 25m that you did not for this\n\nyear. for next year its the same 40 m as always, paid 20 in jan and 20 in july, and then we are done. I will give\nyou advice and counsel but new people will be running your operating machine. I will oversee all the work\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023337",
