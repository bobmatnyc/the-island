Interestingly, Epstein\nnever states that he actually made any settlement offers. Even more interestingly,\nEpstein was never able to explain how a scheme to defraud third party investors ever\ncaused any legally cognizable damage to Epstein himself.\n\nThe supposed “proof” of the Complaint’s allegations against Edwards included\nEdwards’s alleged contacts with the media, his attempts to obtain discovery from\nhigh-profile persons with whom Epstein socialized, and use of “ridiculously\ninflammatory” language in arguments in court. Remarkably, Epstein filed such\nallegations against Edwards despite the fact that Epstein had sexually abused each of\nEdwards’s clients and others while they were minors. Indeed, in discovery Epstein has\nasserted his Fifth Amendment privilege rather than answer questions about the extent\nof the sexual abuse of his many victims. Even more remarkably, after filing his suit\nagainst Edwards, Epstein settled the three cases Edwards handled for an amount that\nEpstein insisted be kept confidential. Without violating the strict confidentiality terms\nrequired by Epstein, the cases did not settle for the “minimal value” that Epstein\nsuggested in his Complaint.\n\nBecause Epstein elected to hide behind the shield of his right against self incrimination\nto preclude his disclosing any relevant information about the criminal activity at the\ncenter of his claims, he was barred from prosecuting his case against Edwards. Under\nthe well-established “sword and shield” doctrine, Epstein could not seek damages\nfrom Edwards while at the same time asserting a Fifth Amendment privilege to block\nrelevant discovery. Here, Epstein tried to do precisely what the “well settled” law\nforbids. Specifically, he tried to obtain “affirmative relief’ — 1.e., forcing Edwards to\npay money damages — while simultaneously precluding Edwards from obtaining\nlegitimate discovery at the heart of the allegations that form the basis for the relief\nEpstein was seeking. As recounted more fully in the statement of undisputed facts\nfiled in support of Edwards’ Motion for Summary Judgment, Epstein has refused to\nanswer such basic questions about his lawsuit as:\n\ne “Specifically what are the allegations against you which you contend Mr.\nEdwards ginned up?”\n\ne “Well, which of Mr. Edwards’ cases do you contend were fabricated?”\n\ne “Ts there anything in L.M.’s Complaint that was filed against you in September\nof 2008 which you contend to be false?”\n\ne “I would like to know whether you ever had any physical contact with the\nperson referred to as Jane Doe in that [federal] complaint?”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029316",
