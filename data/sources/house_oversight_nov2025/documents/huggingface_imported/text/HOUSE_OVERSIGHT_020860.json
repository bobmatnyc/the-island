  "text": "How Did USA Inc.'s Financial Reality\n\nGet to this Difficult Point?\n\nUSA Inc. Has Not Adequately Funded Its Entitlement Programs\n\nRecessions come and go (and affect USA’s revenue), but future claims\n(related to entitlement program commitments) on USA Inc. now\nmeaningfully exceed its projected cash flows.\n\nFor the last 40 years, management (the government) has committed\nmore long-term benefits through ‘entitlement’ programs like Medicaid /\nMedicare / Social Security...without developing a sound plan to pay for\nthem.\n\nMany of these programs provide important services to low-income,\nunemployed, and disabled Americans in great need for help. But without\nproper financing, support may dwindle.\n\nKP\ni USA Inc. | High Level Thoughts 37\n\nUSA Inc. Has Substantially Expanded\n\nlts “Business Lines” Over Past 80 Years\n\nFrom 1789 to 1930, 41%!‘ of USA Inc.’s cumulative\nbudget was dedicated to defense spending (compared\nwith 20%! in F2010), per the Census Bureau.\n\nThis began to change in the 1930s, when the federal\ngovernment substantially expanded its role (in effect,\nexpanded its “business lines”) in response to the Great\nDepression.\n\nNote: 1) 41% is the cumulative defense spending (excluding veterans’ benefits and services) as % of cumulative total federal\nspending from 1789 to 1930. including veterans’ benefits and services, defense spending would have been 49% of cumulative\nannual budget from 1789 to 1930 and would have been 22% in F2009.
