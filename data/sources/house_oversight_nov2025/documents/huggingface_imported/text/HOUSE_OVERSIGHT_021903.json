And, again, off the top of my head, you want\nto know what I can remember right now.\n\nWhat I can remember right now is that in the\nVanity Fair article, the -- in the Vanity Fair article,\nMr. Dershowitz said, I've written 20-some odd books.\nThere's only one person outside my immediate family with\nwhom I share drafts and that's Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nSo I took that as indicating a very close\npersonal association that, you Know, among the people\nthat obviously he's sharing these kinds of things that\nhe wants evaluated before he shares them with the\nbroader world. There's his immediate family and then\nthere's Jeffrey Epstein.\n\nThere was also another similar quote in the\narticle that indicated that -- that Mr. Dershowitz said\nthat he wasn't interested in Epstein just because he has\na lot of money. I mean, Epstein was identified as a\nbillionaire -- billionaire with a B, so the record is\nclear.\n\nBut he said, look, if Epstein wants all his\nmoney, and I'm paraphrasing here, I will be happy to\nwalk down, you know, the Coney Island Boardwalk with him\nand discuss things with him, even if he didn't have any\n\nmoney .\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021903",
