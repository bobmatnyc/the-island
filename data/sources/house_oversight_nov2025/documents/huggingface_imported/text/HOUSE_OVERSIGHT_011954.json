Page Six says his lawyers are thinking about asking prosecutors to drop that requirement\nfrom his plea agreement:\n\nIn a letter drafted, but not sent, to U.S.\n\nAttorney Alexander Costa and obtained by Page Six, Epstein’s lawyer, Gerald\nLefcourt, writes, \"Doing so will have a profound impact [on Epstein] both\nimmediately and forever after. Not only will he be restricted to a wholly\ninappropriate penal facility, but he will be required for the rest of his life\n\nto account for his whereabouts.”\n\nMeanwhile, over the weekend Page Six said that owners of MC2 modeling, run by Jean-Luc\nBrunel — who’s also been accused of favoring underaged models in the past — claim that\nEpstein is not the secret deep pockets behind the firm, no matter what others say or speculate.\n\n43\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011954",
