  "text": "with trying to “describe cancer mathematically.” Epstein preempts Nowak’s\nexplanation (which I’m not quite getting): “Think of cancer the same way as\nyou think of a terrorist group. The NSA has been able to thwart a great\nnumber of terrorism acts by intercepting communication signals from one\nterrorist to another. That same dynamic, a form of signal intelligence, of\nfinding a terrorist in Europe, can be used to intercept communication\nbetween cancer sells. Cancer cells merely communicate in protean code\nrather than electronic code. If you can decode what the signals are saying\nyou can jam those signal between terrorist calls—essentially wipe out their\ncell phones. Likewise if you can decode biological signals you can jam them\ntoo, that’s the holy grail.”\n\nThen Richard Azel, a Nobel prize winner in physiology. Then Ron\nBaron who, in his Baron Fund, has $26 billion under management. Then\nJosh Harris the co-founder of Apollo Global Management ($164 billion\nunder management) and owner of the New Jersey Devils and the\nPhiladelphia 76ers.\n\nPerhaps it’s just the ultimate feminist nightmare: Men (and a few\nopportunistic women) continue to come to Epstein’s because—no matter\ntheir public bows to modern manners—they simply don’t care that he\noffends every aspect of reconstructed gender and political sensibilities. In\nprivate, it remains a man’s world—a rich man’s world.\n\nOr, it’s a guilty pleasure. People who know Jeffrey exchange\n“Jeffrey” stories. “That’s Jeffrey,” says Mort Zuckerman, the real estate\nbillionaire and publisher of the Daily News (ever vitriolic in its coverage of\nEpstein), with a twinkle in his eye and obvious enjoyment, to tales of\nEpstein escapades. It is an outréness that Epstein seems delighted to\ncultivate. In his Paris apartment, 10,000 square feet on the Avenue Foch, a\nneighborhood otherwise occupied by foreign potentates, there is a stuffed\nbaby elephant in his living room—that is, the e/ephant in the room. (Epstein\nsays too it’s a reminder that elephants have 23 copies of tumor suppressor\ngenes and humans have only 1.) The single book on his bedside table is\nLolita (he is, beyond the joke, a great Nobokov fan).\n\nOr, in a more sophisticated view, it’s a two tier understanding of the\nworld. There is a media version of the world, which most of us live in and\nlargely accept, and are certainly influenced by. And then there are those\npeople who live in the media itself and therefore know that it’s mostly bunk.\nIf the media says it, as likely some version of the opposite is true. I might\nguess too that for many of his visitors there’s an order of identification: there\nbut for the grace of God. Any hyper-prominent person might, at any time,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022753",
