  "text": "Code Enforcement Board Meeting Minutes 07/17/08\n\ndogs are not in the area. He said he was bitten by Duke a couple of years ago. He\nwas talking with Dr. Lynn and the dog just reached out and bit him, tearing his\npants and breaking the skin. He said he has been friends with Dr. Lynn and\nMarerit for many years but it was just unsafe for anybody and any animals in the\narea.\n\nBobby Goodnough said he was jogging in the area and the dog lunged at him,\ncausing him to have to dive through a 12 foot hedge to get away from it. He said\nhe just thought it was a matter of time before the dog got a person or a child. Sgt.\nKrauel asked if Mr. Goodnough had reported the incident to the police department\nor had a time frame of occurrence. Mr. Goodnough said he had not made a police\nreport but it occurred about 2 years ago.\n\nLaura Klein, 130 Seaspray Ave., said she had lived here for 12 years, having\nmoved from Washington, D.C. for a sense of security. She said she was now in\nthe process of installing surveillance cameras. She said she could no longer walk\nher dog without constantly looking around, worrying if Duke had once again\nescaped from the open gates. She said it is a privilege to own a dog and dog\nownership and responsibility should go hand in hand. She said Dr. Lynn was\nissued a citation in August of 2002 for locking his dog in a car with the windows\nrolled up. She said she mentioned this to prove his irresponsibility. She said his\nvoluminous file from Animal Care and Control would attest to this. She said no\none was safe while Duke is in Palm Beach.\n\nJames Merola was present on behalf of Dr. Lynn and said he was present on a\nrevised Notice of Code Violation and Hearing dated July 15, 2008. He said he\nwas not denying there were incidents with Duke. Palm Beach County had the dog\ntaken into custody and the hearing was held June 5, 2008. At that hearing, it was\nagreed upon by the County and Dr. Lynn that the dog would be classified as\ndangerous. The dog was classified as dangerous which required certain\nrestrictions on the dog which Dr. Lynn complied with and the dog was returned to\nhim. In the event Duke has another incident, pursuant to state and county law, but\nsome reason not Town law, the dog would be taken into custody and euthanized.\nMr. Merola said Dr. Lynn feels very badly about the situation and agreed with the\nCounty to do what they required. Mr. Merola said Dr. Lynn then received a\nletter, dated June 16, 2008 from the police department, mentioning the order of\nthe County and stating for the first time that the Town was declaring the dog\ndangerous and giving him ten (10) days to appeal, which he did not. On June 20,\n2008, 4 days after the dog was declared dangerous by the Town, the police\ndepartment sent a second letter, citing 10-45 (i), advising that since the dog\nalready had two incidents, they wanted it removed or euthanized. The dog had not\ndone anything since being declared dangerous. This letter did not mention an\nappeal, but he sent a letter anyway, stating they did not agree with that. He said\nthe dog was declared dangerous on June 16\", requirements were imposed and they\ncomplied with those, including the filing of a $1000 bond and they did not agree\nthe dog should now be removed. There was a Town Council hearing on August\n8\" and the Council said they needed to have the dog removed or euthanized. Mr.\n\n2\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016624",
