Hi Paul.

Thanks so much for sharing both your note to Steven and your latest Manson essay with me. It’s
always wild to read that piece. | have parts of it memorized at this point.

After reading your comment about vibes from the movie, | feel like | have some explaining to do.
This is all stream of consciousness writing so take it on merit, | guess. No harm is meant.

As 'The Last of the Manson Girls' got closer to completion, | was insanely nervous about showing it
to you. | knew it there was very little in it that was “Truth" in terms of minute details. What | did
was take the broad strokes of your essay and make it into the “beats” of my story.

For example, Sandy’s invitation to take a bath formed the spine of the “mermaid” scene.
Squeaky’s line, “Manson never took anybody who wasn’t already discarded by the society"
formed the spin of the animated fever dream where she talks about her father. The visit to
Merrick was a good place to get into some of my views about conspiracy and the human mind’s
ability to latch on to anything to avoid unpleasant facts. Squeaky’s line “Well what do you expect
from me. I’m crazy” was obviously later then this meeting, but it was just too good a line to let go.

| didn’t use elements of your essay that made actual filming and production tougher. For example,
the interlude in your essay where you went to a home of friend of the family and smoked weed
for example became “you" smoking weed at their pad.

| added in beats, character traits and dialgoue that helped form that "dramatic arc" that works in
movies so well. You and the Manson Women must have talked about far more than you
mentioned in your essay, but | took liberties with what was said and how it was presented. Maybe
| should have reached out to you about these conversations. | guess | was afraid of the Truth
getting in the way of a good story.
