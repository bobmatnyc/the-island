  "text": "January Iran reportedly went silent about\ntalks. Russia, increasingly frustrated by\n\nthe inability of Tehran and the West to\nnegotiate seriously, vented its frustration.\n“Some of our partners in the six powers\nand the Iranian side cannot come to an\nagreement about where to meet,\" Russian\nForeign Minister Sergei Lavrov told a\nnews conference. \"We are ready to meet\nat any location as soon as possible. We\nbelieve the essence of our talks is far\nmore important (than the site), and we\nhope that common sense will prevail and\nwe will stop behaving like little\nchildren.”\n\nAccording to analysts in Washington,\nreinforced by comments from Iran itself,\na big reason for Tehran’s recalcitrance is\nthat Iran wants to prove to the United\nStates that its vaunted sanctions regime\nwill not force Iran to make unilateral\nconcessions at the bargaining table. In\naddition, Iran is concerned that it won’t\nget much in return in talks with the West,\nand that it will be asked to make\nunilateral concessions on uranium\nenrichment without getting sanctions\nrelief in return. Combined with Iranian\ninternal divisions, as its own presidential\n\nelection season gets underway, that could\nmean that for the next six months or so\nAyatollah Ali Khamenei simply won’t be\nready to talk seriously, despite scheduling\nthe Kazakhstan round.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029729",
