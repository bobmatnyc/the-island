In my view, Mr Trump’s victory will have many social,\ngeopolitical, and economic consequences, but for investors I think he will\nstart a period of ‘Economic Olympics’, whereby the federal governments\naround the world will take more responsibility and be more proactive to help\ntheir ‘national teams’ to become more competitive in this globalised\n\nworld. (1) Free trade is in theory good for economic growth. But there are\nother policies (such as well-directed R&D, efficient investment, an effective\neducational system) that are also extremely important for long-term growth,\nbut have been ignored in the past 15 years because of the globalisation\n\nfad. A slowdown in trade globalisation might not be bad for the global\neconomy, if policy makers replace this engine of growth with other\nstructural improvements. But while globalisation is more about ‘growth\nbeta’, other types of structural reforms are about ‘growth alpha’ and\nfederal/central governments around the world will need to make a greater\neffort at leading the economies to prevent them from falling behind. This is\nlike a government-led program to win Olympic medals, without doping by\ncentral banks. (2) A client kindly brought to my attention an interesting\nreport done by the Harvard Business School that touches on the idea\nmentioned above (‘Problems Unsolved and a Nation Divided: the State of\nUS Competitiveness 2016’). In it, several sensible and consequential points\nwere made: ‘The pressing need for a national economic strategy... Given\nthe significant challenges facing the American economy, the U.S. needs a\nnational economic strategy more than at any other time in recent history. A\nstrategy is an integrated set of priorities that builds on strengths while\nacknowledging and tackling weaknesses... The U.S. lacks an economic\nstrategy, especially at the federal level. The implicit strategy has been to\ntrust the Federal Reserve to solve our problems through monetary\n\npolicy... A national economic strategy for the U.S. will require action by\nbusiness, state and local governments, and the federal government. All\nthree levels have a crucial role to play in restoring competitiveness... Taking\nleadership in improving U.S. competitiveness is a pressing imperative for\nbusiness leaders. Many companies have failed to invest enough in\nimproving the business environments in the regions in which they\noperate...’ This report from the HBS also reiterates some recommendations\nthey made in 2012: ‘/Our/] Eight-Point Plan consists of the following policy\nrecommendations: simplify the corporate tax code with lower statutory rates\nand no loopholes; move to a territorial tax system like all other leading\nnations’; ease the immigration of highly-skilled individuals; aggressively\naddress distortions and abuses in the international trading system; improve\nlogistics, communications, and energy infrastructure, simplify and\nstreamline regulation, create a sustainable federal budget, including reform\nof entitlements; and responsibly develop America’s unconventional energy\nadvantage.’ Interestingly, Mr Trump has discussed many of the same\npoints.
