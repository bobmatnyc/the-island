The gastrointestinal neural net contains millions of neurons and is capable of operating inde-\npendently of the brain. It modulates stress response and other aspects of emotion and motivation\nbased on experience — resulting in so-called \"gut feelings\" [Ger99].\n\nThe Heart’s Neural Network\n. The heart has its own neural network, which modulates stress response, energy level and\nrelaxation/excitement (factors key to motivation and emotion) based on experience [Arm(4].\nPattern Recognition and Memory in the Liver\n. The liver is a complex pattern recognition system, adapting via experience to better identify\ntoxins [C06]. Like the heart, it seems to store some episodic memories as well, resulting in liver\ntransplant recipients sometimes acquiring the tastes in music or sports of the donor [EMC12].\nImmune Intelligence\n. The immune network is a highly complex, adaptive self-organizing system, which ongoingly\nsolves the learning problem of identifying antigens and distinguishing them from the body\nsystem [F P86]. As immune function is highly energetically costly, stress response involves subtle\nmodulation of the energy allocation to immune function, which involves communication between\nneural and immune networks.\nThe Endocrine System: A Key Bridge Between Mind and Body\n. The endocrine (hormonal) system regulates (and is related by) emotion, thus guiding all\naspects of intelligence (due to the close connection of emotion and motivation) [PH12].\nBreathing Guides Thinking\n. As oxygenation of the brain plays a key role in the spread of neural activity, the flow of breath\nis a key driver of cognition. Forced alternate nostril breathing has been shown to significantly\naffect cognition via balancing activity of the two brain hemispheres [SKBB91].\n\nMuch remains unknown, and the totality of feedback loops between the human cognitive\n\ncortex and the various specialized intelligences operative throughout the human body, has not\nyet been thoroughly charted.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013090",
