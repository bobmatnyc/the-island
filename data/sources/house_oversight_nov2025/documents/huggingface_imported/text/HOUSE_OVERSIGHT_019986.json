  "text": "mouthing “Thank you,” crimson tie dipping over his belt.\n\nThis would be Trump’s fifth CPAC address. As much as Steve Bannon liked to see\nhimself as the author of Donald Trump, he also seemed to find it proof of some added\nlegitimacy—and somehow amazing in itself—that since 2011 Trump had basically come\nto CPAC with the same message. He wasn’t a cipher, he was a messenger. The country\nwas a “mess”—a word that had stood the Trump test of time. Its leaders were weak. Its\ngreatness had been lost. The only thing different was that in 2011 he was still reading his\nspeeches with only occasional ad-libs, and now he ad-libbed everything.\n\n“My first major speech was at CPAC,” the president began. “Probably five or six years\nago. My first major political speech. You were there. I loved it. I loved the people. I loved\nthe commotion. They did these polls where I went through the roof. I wasn’t even running,\nright? But it gave me an idea! And I got a little bit concerned when I saw what was\nhappening in the country so I said let’s go to it. It was very exciting. I walked the stage at\nCPAC-. I had very little notes and even less preparation.” (In fact, he read his 2011 speech\nfrom a sheet of paper.) “So when you have practically no notes and no preparation and\nthen you leave and everybody was thrilled. I said, I think I like this business.”\n\nThis first preamble gave way to the next preamble.\n\n“T want you all to know that we are fighting the fake news. It’s phony. Fake. A few\ndays ago I called the fake news the enemy of the people. Because they have no sources.\nThey just make ’em up when there are none. I saw one story recently where they said nine\npeople have confirmed. There are no nine people. I don’t believe there was one or two\npeople. Nine people. And I said, Give me a break. I know the people. I know who they\ntalk to. There were no nine people. But they say nine people... .”\n\nA few minutes into the forty-eight-minute speech and it was already off the rails, riff\nsustained by repetition.\n\n“Maybe they’re just bad at polling. Or maybe they’re not legit. It’s one or the other.\nThey’re very smart. They’re very cunning. And they’re very dishonest... . Just to\nconclude”—although he would go on for thirty-seven minutes more—“‘it’s a very sensitive\ntopic and they get upset when we expose their false stories. They say we can’t criticize\ntheir dishonest coverage because of the First Amendment. You know they always bring\nup’—he went into a falsetto voice—‘“the First Amendment. Now I love the First\nAmendment. Nobody loves it better than me. Nobody.”\n\nEach member of the Trump traveling retinue was now maintaining a careful poker face.\nWhen they did break it, it was as though on a delay, given permission by the crowd’s\ncheering or laughter. Otherwise, they seemed not to know whether the president had in\nfact gotten away with his peculiar rambles.\n\n“By the way, you folks in here, the place is packed, there are lines that go back six\nblocks”—there were no lines outside the crowded lobby—‘I tell you that because you\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019986",
