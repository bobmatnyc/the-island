  "text": "Siegel: Simply stated, our Islamic Enemy seeks the totalitarian domination of Islam throughout the world —\nIslamic supremacy. It seeks to have the West submit to Islam. Obviously, this does not mean that everybody\nbecomes a Muslim. Islam, in all its varied expressions, permits dhimmis- those Christians, Jews, and some\nothers who are permitted to remain as protected non-Muslims as long as they submit to an inferior status. What\nis critical is that Shariah (Islamic Law) ultimately rules the world.\n\nJihad, loosely, is the effort/struggle to see this vision through. The most obvious method of Jihad is through\nviolence; it is the one most familiar to most Westerners and almost all of the Koranic references to Jihad are\nbased in violence. The Violent Jihad includes al-Qaeda and its offshoots as well as other groups that formed\naround the globe independent of al-Qaeda. It also obviously includes the violence from Islamic nations such as\nthe Islamic Republic of Iran whose constitution specifies such vision. It also includes, however, various\nmilitant groups and training camps here in the US as well as ad hoc efforts of individuals.\n\nSince 9/11, there have been something in excess of 15,000 Violent Jihadic attacks across the globe. However,\nas terrible as this is, we have a tendency in the West to think that the only dimension of threat we face comes\nfrom violence. While the Bush administration helped initiate this thinking, the Obama administration has\nactively abused it by limiting any discussion of the threat we face to al-Qaeda and some other terrorist groups\nabroad. As frightening as these groups are, we can get some ease from thinking they are a band of “extremists\nlimited in number, weaponry, sophisticati on, and means. Stunningly, Hillary Clinton recently estimated that\nthere are only about 50,000 “homicidal” violent extremists around the world who simply have been able to\nproject power much greater than their number should allow. Here the Control Factor makes the threat appear\nmore easily manageable.\n\nJihad, however, is pursued in other often even more effective ways which I have grouped into three “levels.” A\nsecond more insidious level of threat is what the Muslim Brotherhood itself called the “Civilization Jihad.” It\nis the effort to infiltrate all aspects of our society, peacefully according to our laws, in order to later be in\nposition to sabotage and destroy it from the inside. The Civilization Jihadists have learned the culture and rules\nof the territories they seek to command and use those rules to maneuver—specifically using our freedoms to\ndestroy our freedoms. They use “lawfare” to seek changes in our laws so as to push Shariah into our society.\nYour readers should read Daniel Pipes and Brooke Goldstein’s Lawfare Project material and others to fully\nappreciate how cancerous this activity has become. This includes intimidating in a variety of ways anyone who\nspeaks out against them or Islam and seeking to squelch our treasured broad right to free speech so as to\nultimately prevent any criticisms of Islam. Once criticism of Islam is prohibited, little can stop it from\ncascading throughout the culture.\n\nThe Civilization Jihad includes situating such Jihadists in critical positions in the society, in the government, in\nthe legal system, the military, and elsewhere. It includes the control over university programs that distribute\npropaganda about Islam and Islamic history which then filters down throughout textbooks for even younger\nstudents. It includes control over most of the nation’s mosques and local Imams guiding the mess ages engaged\nMuslims are receiving. Most troublesome are the Muslim g roups (CAIR, ISNA, MSA and others associated\nand/or joint venture partners with the Muslim Brotherhood) supposedly interested in “outreach” which know\nhow to appear Westernized and interested in the goals of Western Civilization. They have fooled a large part of\nour authorities and media due in part to their patience and willingness to chip away, one airport prayer room,\none frivolous intimidating lawsuit, one Congressman or CIA officer, one mosque, one ruling at a time.\n\nParticularly in the US, given our deep attachment to freedom as well as cultural and psychological tendencies\ntoward diversity, Western guilt and expectations of truthfulness, this effort is devious and difficult to uproot.\nThe Civilization Jihadists present one face to the American public which is completely at odds with their true\nagenda and how they deal in private. Jamie, you and David and others such as Steve Emerson, Frank Gaffney,\nAndy McCarthy and others have done s o much to uncover this level of Jihad that your readers should be urged\nto review as much of their work (including Steve’s recent excellent documentary, The Grand Deception, and\nFrank’s important web video course, The Muslim Brotherhood in America) as possible.\n\nFinally, there is a third level — the International Institutional Jihad. Here the most powerful international\ninstitutions such as the UN and the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and others seek to push into America\nfrom without those changes which are difficult to complete from within. The OIC is the largest Islamic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024398",
