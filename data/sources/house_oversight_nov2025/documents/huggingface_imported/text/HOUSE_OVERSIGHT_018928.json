  "text": "REITER jrom 1B\n\nney’s office for two reasons.\nFirst, he pressed for Epstein\nto be charged with the more\nserious crimes of sexual ac-\ntivity with minors. Second, he\nslammed State Attorney Bar-\nryKrischer in blunt language\nseldom used by one law-\nerfforcement official con-\ncerning another because of\nwhat he perceived as that of\nfice’s mishandling of the\ncase.\n\n‘vIn a letter to Krischer\n\nwritten May 1, Reiter called’\n\nhis actions in the Epstein\ncase “highly unusual.” He\nadded, “Imusturge youto...\nconsider if good and suffi-\ncient reason exists to require\nyour disqualification from the\nprosecution of these cases.’\nIn short, Reiter told the\ncounty’s top prosecutor for\nthe past 13 years that he\nought to get off the case. “It\n\n‘looks like a departure from\n\nprofessionalism,” Miami-\nDade State Attorney\nKatherine Fernandez Rundle\nsaid of Reiter’s letter.\nFollowing Epstein’s in-\ndictment, Reiter referred the\ncase to the FBI to determine\nwhether the _ super-rich,\nsuper-connected defendant\nhad violated any federal laws.\n\nReiter won’t discuss the\ncase or the broadsides aimed\nat him. But others almost\nuniformly use one word to\ndescribe the chief: profes-\nsional.\n\n“I have always been im-\npressed by Mike’s profes-\nsionalism and his leader-\nship,” said Rick Lincoln, chief\nof the Lantana Police Depart-\nment and a Palm Beach\nCounty cop for 32 years.\n\n“The town of Palm Beach\nhas a very professional police\ndepartment. We all consider\n\nMike to be our peer and a-\n\nman of integrity.”\n\nReiter: Town\nManager Peter\nElwell says the\nPalm Beach\npolice chief's\nwell worth his\n$144,000 sal-\nary.\n\nJuno Beach Police Chief\nH.C. Clark II agreed. Al-\nthough he doesn’t know Re-\niter well, he has met with him\non countywide law enforce-\nment issues. “T’ve never seen\nhim lose his cool. I’ve never\nseen anything but a profes-\nsional demeanor from him.”\n\nReiter joined the Palm\nBeach Police Department in\n1981, leaving a $20,000-a-year\npatrol job at the University of\nPittsburgh. His personnel\njacket shows consistently ex-\ncellent job evaluations.\n\nPosh Palm Beach is no\nhotbed of crime, and in his\nfirst year on the job, a resi-\n\ndent confined to his home\nwith a sick child thanked Re-\niter for delivering afew Cokes\n\nto the house. Reiter refused -\n\npayment for the beverages.\nAnother resident thanked\nReiter for shutting off his\ncar’s headlights in his drive-\nway, saying a valet must have\nbeen at fault.\n\nReiter worked everything\nfrom road patrol to organized\ncrime, vice and narcotics.\nAnd he’s no novice at investi-\ngations involving the island’s\n\nrich and famous. He was the ©\n\nlead detective probing the\ndrug overdose death of David\nKennedy in 1984. He also was\none of the officers who\nworked the investigation of\nWilliam Kennedy Smith, who\nwas charged in 1991 — and\nlater acquitted — with raping\na woman at the Kennedy\nfamily compound in Palm\nBeach.\n\nReiter, who has amaster’s\ndegree in human resource\n\n, Integrity\n\ndevelopment from Palm\n\nBeach Atlantic University, al- .\n\nso has attended the FBI Na-\ntional Academy in Quantico,\n\nVa., and management cours\n\nes at Harvard. He’s been ac‘\ntive in countywide interagen-\ncy law enforcement\norganizations and has a “top\nsecret” national security\nclearance.\n\n“He has a_ perspective\nthat’s broader than just ad-\ndressing the needs of the\ntown,” said Town Manager\nPeter Elwell, who promoted\nReiter from assistant chief to\nchief in March 2001. Reiter\nmakes more than $144,000 as\nthe town’s top cop. Elwell\nthinks he’s worth it.\n\n“He’s very businesslike,\nvery straightforward. He's\nnot easily agitated or flam-\nboyant. He’s about the work,\nElwell said. “I think that his\nservice as chief has been\noutstanding in five-plus\nyears,’\n\n@ larry_keller@pbpost.com\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018928",
