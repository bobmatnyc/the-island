  "text": "fire.” For the present God restrained\nhuman wickedness “by his mighty\npower, as he does the raging waves of\nthe troubled sea,” but, if God should\nwithdraw that restraining power,\nhumanity’s willful self-regard would\noverturn nature. The most dangerous\nfire in creation was not, therefore, the\nfire of hell but rather the hellfire bursting\nforth from an unrestrained human will:\n“The corruption of the heart of man is a\nthing that is immoderate and boundless\nin its fury; and while wicked men live\nhere, it is like fire pent up by God’s\nrestraints,” but, should God ever relax\nhis governance, humanity’s boundless\nfury “would set on fire the course of\nnature.”\n\nThe turmoil stirred by human\nwillfulness, like a violent storm at sea,\nthreatened to capsize the ark of the\nuniverse, and the earth responded to this\nthreat in a terrifying version of the\npathetic fallacy, in which not empathy\nbut enmity arose between humans and\ntheir natural environment.\nConsequently, except for “the sovereign\npleasure of God, the earth would not\nbear you one moment,” and Edwards\nwarned the Enfield congregation that\n“the creation groans with you” and\nresented its subservience to human\nusurpation: “the sun don’t willingly\nshine upon you to give you light to serve\nsin and Satan; the earth don’t willingly\nyield her increase to satisfy your lusts;\nnor is it willingly a stage for your\nwickedness to be acted upon; the air\ndon’t willingly serve you for breath to\nmaintain the flame of life in your vitals,\nwhile you spend your life in the service\nof God’s enemies. God’s creatures are\ngood, and were made for men to serve\nGod with, and do not willingly subserve\nto any other purpose, and groan when\nthey are abused to purposes so directly\n\n107\n\nPage\n\ncontrary to their nature and end.” A\nrebellious humanity antagonized the rest\nof creation, “and the world would spew\nyou out, were it not for the sovereign\nhand of him who hath subjected it in\nhope.”\n\nThe just order of the cosmos\nwould rightly destroy humanity for its\nwillful rebellion against the order of the\nwhole, and the fact that this had not\nalready happened was the expression of\nsomething like the self-restraining mercy\nof a monarch who does not order the\nexecution of a traitor who has offended\nthe royal honor: “The bow of God’s\nwrath is bent, and the arrow made ready\non the string, and Justice bends the\narrow at your heart, and strains the bow,\nand it is nothing but the mere pleasure of\nGod, and that of an angry God, without\nany promise or obligation at all, that\nkeeps the arrow one moment from being\nmade drunk with your blood.”\n\nThe Great Awakening was\ncoterminous and interactive with the\neighteenth century development of the\nmodern physical sciences, especially\nbuilding on the work of Isaac Newton\n(1642-1727). Edwards’s assumptions\nabout the harmonious order of creation\ncombined the science of his day with the\naristocratic social order of eighteenth-\ncentury society. In warning the town of\nEnfield that it had transgressed the\ncosmic order, Williams was also\nasserting that it had violated the societal\naspect of that order; as minister, he\ncalled the town to task for both\nviolations.\n\nConclusion\n\nEdwards imagined the\nNewtonian universe as an aristocratic\nsocial hierarchy held in harmony by\nsovereign law, at once moral and natural.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021353",
