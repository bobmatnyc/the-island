In one reported instance, the private\ninvestigator claimed to be a police officer, and Reiter considered filing witness-tampering charges.\n\nThe credibility of the victims was also an issue; they had never complained of their treatment by Epstein until they\nwere contacted by police, and they may have voluntarily returned to the Palm Beach mansion several times. Many of\nthe girls came from disadvantaged backgrounds or broken homes, and they were susceptible to Epstein’s cash,\nintimidation, and charm. Those who were 16 when they went to El Brillo Way would have been in their 20s by the time\nthey took the stand, and Epstein’s investigators had dredged up every instance of bad behavior in their pasts.\nAccording to an exchange in the Reiter deposition, a few of the victims had worked in West Palm Beach at massage\nparlors known as “jack shacks.” Each new compromising detail was immediately forwarded to the State Attorney's\nOffice, where staff met frequently with Epstein’s lawyers.\n\nThe Florida statutes are clear: Any person older than 24 who engages in sexual contact with someone under the age\n| of 18 commits a felony of the second degree. The victim’s prior sexual conduct is not relevant; ignorance of her age is\n| no defense. She needn't resist physically to cast doubt on the issue of “consent.” For a child under 16, even lewd\nbehavior short of touching is a felony of the second degree. But convincing a jury that a sexual encounter is a heinous\ncrime is difficult if the victim can be made to appear willing and unharmed, not to mention vulgar and mercenary. It\nwasn’t hard to imagine some of the victims quickly being discredited in court by Epstein’s crack legal team, who\nrepeatediy noted that the age of consent is lower in many other states.\n\nBut that doesn’t quite explain why the Department of Justice would forgo the child-trafficking charges, which pertain\nregardless of a girl’s attitude or character. Epstein’s final sentence is so out of line with the statutory guidelines for that\ncrime that it appears the department may have been influenced by the existence of his many powerful friends and\nattorneys. A highly intelligent man who once taught math at the Dalton School in New York without a bachelor’s\ndegree, Epstein has been a serious and respected player in the highest reaches of politics and philanthropy. He has\nmade substantial contributions to political candidates, served on the Council on Foreign Relations, and donated $30\nmillion to Harvard University.\n\nMoreover, many of his high-powered acquaintances availed themselves of Epstein’s private jets, for which the pilot\nlogs, obtained by discovery in the civil suits, sometimes showed that bold-face names were on the same flights as\nunderage girls. A high-profile trial threatened to splash mud over all sorts of big players, just as both Gov. Richardson\nand Bill Clinton’s wife were running for president. Also, a hedge fund prosecution in which Epstein offered to give\nevidence was heating up. Alberto Gonzales, who was U.S. attorney general throughout most of the Epstein\ninvestigation and resigned just before the non-prosecution agreement was signed, told The Daily Beast that he “would\nhave instructed the Justice Department to pursue justice without making a political mess.” But that may have been an\nimpossible mandate, given the players involved.\n\nInstead, said attorney Brad Edwards, “Epstein committed crimes that should have jailed him for most of his life...he\nwas jailed for only a few months.” And this week he waiks through his door a free man.\n\nConchita Samoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced\nthree current events debate television programs, The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The\nOppenheimer Report.
