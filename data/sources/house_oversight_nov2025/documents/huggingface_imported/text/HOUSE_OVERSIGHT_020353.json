So he was given $5,000 in cash and a plane\nticket to Vienna, where he was domiciled at the residence of the Soviet ambassador to Austria. A\nKGB’s electronic communications expert, Anatoly Slavnov, was then sent to Vienna to supervise\nthe Pelton debriefings. The debriefing sessions, which went on for 15 days, were from 8 AM to 6\nPM. In them, Pelton managed to recall Project A, a joint NSA-CIA-Navy operation in which\nsubmarines surreptitiously tapped into Soviet undersea cables in the Sea of Okhotsk, which\nconnected a to the Soviet Pacific Fleet's mainland headquarters at Vladivostok. Pelton received\nanother $30,000 from the KGB.\n\n“Did the information in his head proved valuable?” I asked.\n\n“As long as the NSA didn’t know the tap was compromised by Pelton, we could use the cable\nto send to the NSA the information we wanted it to intercept.” He said while actual NSA\ndocuments would have proved more useful than someone’s memories, “Our job is to take\nadvantage of whatever we can get.”\n\nTwo years later, Pelton was again flown to Vienna for a follow-up debriefing to see if he could\nrecall any further details. Finally, in 1985, Pelton was arrested by the FBI and, like Ames and\nHanssen, sentenced to life imprisonment.\n\nLooking at his watch, Cherkashin politely excused himself, saying he had work to do. On\nparting, I signed a copy of my book on Angleton for him and thanked him for his insights.\n\nThrough the eyes of the KGB, a penetration of American intelligence was clearly\nopportunistic. If these practices continued, they put the Snowden case in a new light for me. If\nRussian intelligence considered it worthwhile to send an ex-civilian worker at the NSA, such as\nRonald Pelton, from Washington D.C. 2,000 miles to Austria so that its specialists could debrief\nhim on the secrets he held in his head, it would have an even greater interest in exfiltrating\nSnowden from Hong Kong to get, aside from his documents, whatever secrets he held in his head.\nIf Russian intelligence was willing to opportunistically accept the delivery of U.S. secrets from an\nunknown espionage source that it neither recruited nor controlled, such as Hanssen, it would have\nlittle hesitancy in acquiring the secrets that Snowden had stolen on his own volition, even if\nSnowden acted for idealistic reasons. If Russian intelligence focused its search pattern on\ndisgruntled American intelligence workers, such as Ames, it is plausible that it spotted Snowden\nthrough his Internet rants against U.S. surveillance. Even if it had missed Snowden in Hawaii, a\ndisgruntled ex-civilian employee at the NSA would have received its full attention after he\ncontacted Russian officials in Hong Kong. While the tactics of the SVR may have changed since\nCherkashin retired, its objectives remained the same. And the NSA remained its principal target.\nNor is there any reason to doubt that it still measures success in its ability to obtain, by whatever\nmeans, the secret sources and methods of its adversaries. Snowden was in a position, both with\nthe documents he had taken and the knowledge he had in his head, to deliver the KGB such a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020353",
