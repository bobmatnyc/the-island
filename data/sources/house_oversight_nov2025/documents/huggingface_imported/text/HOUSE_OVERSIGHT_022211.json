BROWN\nMiami Herald\n\nIn recent court filings, the government was\nforced to answer questions about its negotia-\ntions, finally admitting in 2013 that federal\nprosecutors had backed down under relentless\npressure by Jeffrey Epstein’s attomeys.\n\n“The government admits that, at least in part\nas a result of objections lodged by Epstein’s law-\nyers to victim notifications, the [United States\nAttomey’s Office] reevaluated its obligations\nto provide notification to victims and Jane Doe\n#1 was thus not told that the\nUS.AO had entered into a\nnon-prosecution agreement\nwith Epstein until after it\nwas signed,” wrote Assistant\n| U.S. Attorney Dexter Lee.\n| Said Francey Hakes, the\nformer federal prosecutor:\n“| have never heard of a case\nwhere federal prosecutors\nconsult with a defense at-\ntorney before they send out\nstandard victim notification\nletters. To negotiate what\nthe letters would say and whether they would be\nsent at all suggest that the victims’ rights were\nviolated multiple times.”\n\nKenneth Starr's aggressive advocacy for\nEpstein against allegations of improper sexual\nbehavior was in stark contrast to the path he\ntook investigating President Bill Clinton as\nindependent counsel forthe Whitewater probe.\n\nThe Starr Report, the summary of his find\nings in the Whitewater investigation, which\nstarted as a probe of a land deal gone sour and\nveered into an investigation of sexual miscon-\nduct, savaged the president for his involvement\nwith White House intern Monica Lewinsky and\nwas the basis for impeachment.\n\nStarr himself would face criticism in 2016 —\nhe stepped down as president of Baylor Univer-\nsity amid allegations that he and other university\nofficials mishandled sexual assault allegations\nbrought by female students against members of\nthe school’s football team.\n\nThe Miami Herald reached out to Starr,\nthrough certified letter and through a spokesman\nfor his current law firm, the Lanier Firm, but did\nnot receive a response for this story.\n\nPalm Beach police detective Joseph Recarey,\none of the most highly decorated officers on\nthe Palm Beach Police Department, called the\nEpstein case the most troubling of his 23-year\ncareer.\n\n“Some of the victims were — and still are —\nafraid of Epstein,” he said as part of a series of\ninterviews with the Herald earlier this year.\n\nPrivately, Michael Reiter and Recarey said\nthey held onto hope that Epstein would be\nbrought to trial someday, but they said that that\nnotion had faded.\n\n“Lalways hoped that the plea would be\nthrown out and that these teenage girls, who\nwere labeled as prostitutes by prosecutors,\nwould get to finally shed that label and see him\ngo to prison where he belongs,” Recarey said.\n\nRecarey died in May after a briefillness. He\n\nKenneth\nStarr\n\nFile photo by MIAMI HERALD\n\nAfter he pleaded guilty in state court, Jeffrey Epstein was assigned to a private section of the Palm Beach County stockade. Soon, however, he\nwas allowed to leave the compound six days a week, 12 hours a day, for what was termed work release.\n\nSietwe: | Relemed -Reavired to\n\ntoe wiTss\n\nJeffrey Epstein, ac-\ncused of sexually\nabusing dozens of un-\nderage women, grins\nfor his mugshot on\nFlorida's sex offender\nregistry.
