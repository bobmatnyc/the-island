Consistent with\nthis hypothesis, measures of sociality in\ntroops of baboons have been found to be\nhighly correlated with infant survival,\nand cross-species comparisons have\nshown that the evolution of large and\nmetabolically expensive brains is more\nclosely associated with social than\necological complexity (9).\n\nOur survival depends on our\nconnection with others. Born to the\nmost prolonged period of utter\ndependency of any animal, human\ninfants must instantly engage their\nparents in protective behavior, and the\nparents must care enough about their\noffspring to nurture and protect them. If\ninfants do not elicit nurturance and\nprotection from caregivers, or if\ncaregivers are not motivated to provide\nsuch care over an extended period of\ntime, then the infants will perish along\nwith the genetic legacy of the parents\n(J0). Our developmental dependency\nmirrors our evolutionary heritage.\nHunter/gatherers did not have the benefit\nof natural weaponry, armor, strength,\nflight, stealth, or speed relative to many\nother species. Human survival depended\non collective abilities, not on individual\nmight.\n\nSelfish Genes, Social Brains\n\nIt is the gene that is obligatorily\nselfish, not the human brain. Genes that\npromote behaviors that increase the odds\nof the genes surviving are perpetuated.\nOne implication of this simple insight is\nthat evolution can be viewed as the\ncompetition between genes using\nindividuals and social structures as their\ntemporary vehicles. The genetic\nconstitution of Homo Sapiens in the long\n\nPage |22\n\nrun derives not solely from the\nreproductive success of individuals, but\nalso from the success of their children to\nreproduce. Hunter/gatherers who did not\nform social connections and who did not\nfeel a compulsion to return to share their\nfood or defense with their offspring may\nhave been more likely to survive to\nprocreate again, but given the long\nperiod of dependency of human infants\ntheir offspring may have been less likely\nto survive to procreate. The result is\nselection that strongly favors the ability\nto process information that could\ncontribute to the formation and\nmaintenance of social capacities and\nconnections — that is, a social brain.\nThese social capacities evolved hand in\nhand with genetic, neural, and hormonal\nmechanisms to support them because the\nresulting social behaviors helped humans\nsurvive, reproduce, and care for\noffspring sufficiently long that they too\nsurvived to reproduce (//-1/3). Relative\nto other animals, the striking\ndevelopment of and increased\nconnectivity within the human cerebral\ncortex, especially the frontal and\ntemporal regions, are among the key\nevolutionary developments in this\nregard. The cerebral cortex is a mantle\nof between 2.6 to 16 billion neurons with\neach neuron receiving 10,000 to 100,000\nsynapses in their dendritic trees (e.g.,\n14). The expansion of the frontal\nregions in the human brain contributes to\nthe human capacities for reasoning,\nplanning, performing mental\nsimulations, theory of mind, and\nthinking about self and others. The\ntemporal regions of the brain, in turn, are\ninvolved with aspects of social\nperception, memory, and\ncommunication. The means for guiding\nbehavior through the environment\nemerged prior to neocortical expansion.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021268",
