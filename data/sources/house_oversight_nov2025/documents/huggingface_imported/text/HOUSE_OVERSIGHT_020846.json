  "text": "Why We Wrote This Report\n\nAs American citizens / tax payers, we care about the future of our country.\n\nAs investors, we search for data and insights to help us make better\ninvestment decisions. (It’s easier to predict the future with a keen\nunderstanding of the past.)\n\nWe found ourselves searching for better information about the state of America’s\nfinancials, and we decided to assemble — in one place and in a user-friendly format\n— some of the best data about the world’s biggest “business.” In addition, we have\nattempted to provide some historical context for how USA Inc.’s financial model has\nevolved over decades.\n\nThe complexity of USA Inc.’s challenges is well Known, and our presentation is just\na starting point; it’s far from perfect or complete. But we are convinced that citizens\n— and investors — should understand the business of their government. Thomas\nJefferson and Alexis de Tocqueville knew that — armed with the right information —\nthe enlightened citizenry of America would make the right decisions. It is our\nhumble hope that a transparent financial framework can help inform future debates.\n\nKP\ni USA Inc. | Introduction 9\n\nWhat You'll Find Here...\n\nIn the conviction that every citizen should understand the finances of\nUSA Inc. and the plans of its “management team,” we examine USA Inc.’s\nincome statement and balance sheet and present them in a basic, easy-to-\nuse format.\n\nIn this document, a broad group of people helped us drill into our federal\ngovernment's basic financial metrics. We summarize our thoughts in PowerPoint\nform here and also have provided a brief text summary at www.kpcb.com/usainc.\n\nWe encourage people to take our data and thoughts and study them, critique them,\naugment them, share them, and make them better. There’s a lot of material — think\nof it as a book that happens to be a slide presentation.\n\nKP\na USA Inc. | Introduction 10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020846",
