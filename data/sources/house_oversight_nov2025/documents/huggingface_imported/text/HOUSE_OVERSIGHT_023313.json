  "text": "Your office is a multi billion dollar responsibility. your children will inherit it , in order to oversee their\nfinancial lives- I feel for you, truly ,but the facts are the facts, your ceo ( Brad) has provided one bad\ndocument after another for over a year , no getting away from it,, bad cashflows nonewIT, each time\nwith \" its gettting better\" no in fact -! itsnot. - the excuse, that Brad is not the numbers guy, is ludicrous.\nof course he didnt actually prepare the statements. - no ceo would ,- but over and over he presented them to\nyou and me, after , holding them back for his personal review multiple times and after multiple drafts. weeks\nof his editing, the consistant but \"inexplicable \"missing the obvious serious errors .( gaming ) inaccuracies,\n( cashflow ) and mistakes (tax returns). why, ?! the simple answer is that at best, he is a c minus, (note. I, like\nyou ,also give points for effort. )-! an elegant art partnership gone fallow. ??!!I and its core reason to exist.\nnot used ? no docs for plane?, still! why? no docs for decantings why? the docs for deal 1 received last\nnight , \"no docs at all for deal 2, the biggest \". why wasn't Tom brought in, after 4 times of my incessant\nreminders ispoke to him , he knows little of either transaction except for over view. never saw pahidon\nanything except projections until yesterday ? ?and this after your clear admonition etc. re the trading\naccounts no activity, at all,\n\nBarry Cohen is great. more like him please .\nyou asked ,- I did my best trying to train your brad chosen people in the face of my telling you that they were\nnever going to be more than c-minuses, thousands of emails thousands ? Brad at its head . you can't asa\nceo, have an accountant give you multiple pages with the most important numbers missing altogether and not\nnotice, you and IJ saw the errrors right away ,as did my very junior bookeeper after only a cursory glance. He\ntold me he didnt know the details of his note? ! , my guess is that he wanted to pay less. no more than that, any\nother story is blather. its silly. Talk to richard yourself.\nre your estate. Yes another Brad issue - your will, needs revision. the tenants in common structure I assume\nAlan has carefully walked you through. it is way overdue, needed and exciting. I won't list the more serious\nissues in an email but we can speak over the weekend.\n\nHow can Thelp? We agreed at the time when you hired Castrucci , that when you fired him, I would bear no\nresponsibility because it was clear that he shouldnt be hired. brad and you both said ,\" its on us\", but... the\nequivalent of your art consultant pointing to a picasso and calling itarenoir. then a brancusi and calling it a\nmichaelangelo. those were the types of erros that i saw immediatily, you said give them more time. at least\nthey saw it was a painting and not a photo?\n\nbeing weaned of our biz /pay realtionship has been our mutual goal. However since novemebr, you chose to\ndo so by ignoring' our agreement re, phaidon,and your oft stated commitment to me of large payments for\nlarge value, (37 percent was our number ). chose to pay me a number picked by what appears to be only by\nwhim,- have yet to justify it except for telling me that you and Brad Karp talked...\n\nWhat should we do? the next two years in biz world appears to both you and I, very fragile. Im happy to\nhave brad sit in ?\n\nDate: Thu, Oct 15, 2015 at 10:38 PM\n\nSubject:\nTo: Melanie Spinella Po\nOffice, - adagoes. ,hire heather a paralegal.
