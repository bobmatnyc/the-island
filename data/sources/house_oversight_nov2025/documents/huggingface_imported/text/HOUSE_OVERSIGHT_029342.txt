Dear Jeffrey-

We are thrilled to announce that we are working with Congressman Hakeem Jeffries, one of the rising stars in
the New York Congressional delegation. Sometimes referred to as "Brooklyn's Barack", he is a staunch
supporter of President Obama and a progressive voice for the people of New York City. NY1 did a profile piece
about his work on the vitally important Budget and Judiciary committees in Washington. You can watch the
video here or read the text below.

Hakeem is committed to electing a Democratic majority in 2014 and is encouraging his friends to participate in
the DCCC/DSCC fundraising dinner with President Obama this coming Monday night. Shoot us an email or
give us a call at (212) 531-2858 if you would like to get involved with the dinner, or would like to get an
opportunity to get to know Hakeem better. He is an impressive guy and who will be a progressive voice in New
York politics for years to come.

Thanks,
Darren Rigger, Lisa Rossi & Walter Swett

NY1: Hakeem Jeffries Positions Himself For Long Career In Washington

Apr 29, 2013
By: Michael Scotto

Hakeem Jeffries is only about four months into his freshman year in Congress but he's already positioning
himself for a long career in Washington. NY 1's Michael Scotto filed the following report.

If you're looking to knock Hakeem Jeffries off message, you won't get very far.

"There's a hip hop song, every day I'm hustling, and I kind of feel that way down here in Washington," Jeffries
said. "In a positive manner, of course."
