  "text": "ELECTION DAY\n\nn the afternoon of November 8, 2016, Kellyanne Conway—Donald Trump’s\n() campaign manager and a central, indeed starring, personality of Trumpworld—\nsettled into her glass office at Trump Tower. Right up until the last weeks of the race, the\nTrump campaign headquarters had remained a listless place. All that seemed to distinguish\nit from a corporate back office were a few posters with right-wing slogans.\n\nConway now was in a remarkably buoyant mood considering she was about to\nexperience a resounding if not cataclysmic defeat. Donald Trump would lose the election\n—of this she was sure—but he would quite possibly hold the defeat to under 6 points.\nThat was a substantial victory.

When\nTrump needed the push, the push just wasn’t there.\n\nThat was the first part of Conway’s spin. The other part was that despite everything,\nthe campaign had really clawed its way back from the abyss.
