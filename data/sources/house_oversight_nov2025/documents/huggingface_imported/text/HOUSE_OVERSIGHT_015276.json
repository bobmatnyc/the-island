  "text": "before the Internet, the dead pool was slowly emerging from the shadows\nof our culture.”\n\nAs with dead pools, ranging from business offices to Howard\nStern’ s radio show, that book is a guide to profiting from money bets.\nBut members of The Game play solely for the fun of it. Whoever has the\nmost points at the end of the year wins-- “bragging rights only” —slightly\nironic since Gamesters (lawyers, ad people, educators, psychology\nprofessors, writers, everyday working folks) all play under aliases like\nFrozen Stiff, Fade to Black, Worm Feast, Decomposers, 2 Dead Crew,\nJohnny B. Dead, Wm. Randolph Hearse, Daisy Pusher, Silk Shroud,\nNecrophiliac Pimp, Legion of Doom, Gang Green, Habeas Corpse, Die-\nUretic, Shovelin’ Off, Blunt Instrument, Rig R. Mortis, Flatliners,\nUnplugged, Toe Tag, Clean Underwear and Gratefully Dead.\n\nOne couple, the Moorebids, insist, “We play for honor, not\nbragging rights. It has to do with honoring who you get the hit on.”\n\nAnother player told me, “Il compare playing The Game to my day\njob, science. We do a lot of data collection and data analysis; play our\nhunches. Our reward is not financial, but peer recognition. One selects\nsome names to acknowledge the person. Other names are selected\n\nbecause earning you points is their last opportunity to do something\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015276",
