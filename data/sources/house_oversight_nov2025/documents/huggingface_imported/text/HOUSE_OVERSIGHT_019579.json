Snowden, it will be recalled,\nhad falsely identified himself to them in an e-mail as a senior mem-\nber of the intelligence community.\n\nSnowden led Greenwald and Poitras to the nearby elevator, and\nthey went through various corridors of the hotel to his room on\nthe tenth floor. It was mainly occupied by a king-sized bed, but it\nalso featured a sleek writing desk in the corner, two chairs, and a\nmodernistic lamp. The bathroom was behind a glass partition, which\ncould be closed off by a black louver blind. There was also a small\nrefrigerator in which Snowden asked them to stow their cell phones.\n\nSnowden, as we know, had already told Poitras that he wanted\nher to make a documentary of the meeting. She therefore wasted\nno time in mounting her camera on a tripod. “Minutes after meet-\ning, I set up the camera,” she said. Snowden told her, “When you\n\n© are involved in an action which is likely to get you indicted, you ®\ntypically don’t have a camera rolling in the room.” Nevertheless,\nhe allowed her to film his actions for the next eight days.

Over\nthe next week, she would shoot over twenty hours of Snowden’s\nactivities in that small room. It was essentially a one-man show, a\npresentation of him, by himself, for the appreciation of a global pub-\nlic. Poitras knew virtually nothing about her subject until ten min-\nutes before she began filming him. She had not even googled him,\nbecause she was concerned that her Internet search might alert the\nNSA and law enforcement authorities. In an over-the-top waiver of\nhis own privacy, he allowed her to film him washing in the bath-\nroom, preening his hair in the mirror, napping on his bed, getting\ndressed, and packing his bag. He even permitted her to film a private\ncomputer exchange between him and Mills (who was in Honolulu).\nThat day Mills informed Snowden that two government investiga-\ntors had come to their home in Hawaii, asking her about Snowden’s\nwhereabouts.
