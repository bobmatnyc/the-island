  "text": "(A1.1), (A1.6), (A1.7) and (A1.8) are alternative statements of the total return\n\ntruism.\n\nIn general, define g(Q)=Q/Q for any variable Q. Note again that g in this book\n\nmeans growth rate of capital g(K,) rather than output. g in macro tradition usually\nmeans growth of output g(Y). Total capital K,. is the sum of human capital H and\n\nphysical capital K. Their outputs respectively are work W and (net) profit P. Their\ncounterparts to (A1.1) and (A1.6a) are\n\nW=H+F(H), r(H)=g(H)+f(H), P=K+F(K) and r{K)=g(K)+f(K), (A1.8)\n\nwhere F(H), f(H), F(K) and f(K) are respectively “human cash flow”, “human cash\n\nyw tt\n\nflow rate”, “physical cash flow” and “physical cash flow rate”.\n\nPresent Value and Present Cost\n\nIf there were no such thing as time preference, present and future value would be\nthe same. All economists known to me concede that we prefer present goods to\nfuture ones, although some like Joseph Schumpter have seen no good reason why. |\n\nsuggest a reason in next generation theory.\n\nPresent value theory, understood in essence by the Sumerians, considers what we\n\nnow call future positive cash flows which are expected to be generated from\n\nexternal investments (transfer in, negative cash flow) made now or earlier. At the\n\ndifferential (infinitesimal) scale, we can write the associated future value as\ndFV(z)=F (z)dz (2.1)\n\nat future moment z. The basic idea of present value PV is\n\nAPPENDIX A: The Argument in Notation 3/7/16 4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011130",
