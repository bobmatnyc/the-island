He was\npaying me very well because I'd give him sex\nwhenever he wanted it.’\n\nShe was, she says, delighted when Epstein\ninvited her to accompany him on a six-week trip\nin 2001.\n\n‘He said we'd be going to Europe and North\nAfrica to meet architects and interior decorators\nbecause he wanted to redo his New Mexico\nhouse.\n\n| threw my arms around him and gave hima\npeck on the cheek.’ They flew to Paris, then\nSpain, then Tangier.\n\nFinally, they went to London. ‘After we landed,\nwe drove straight to Ghislaine’s house,’ says\nVirginia. ‘Il was given a small upstairs bedroom.\nThe following morning, Ghislaine came in.\n\nShe was chirpy and jumped on the bed saying,\n“Get up, sleepyhead. You've got a big day.\nWe've got to go shopping. You need a dress as\nyou're going to dance with a Prince tonight.”\n\n‘She said | needed to be “smiley” and bubbly\nbecause he was the Queen’s son.\n\nGhislaine and | went to Burberry, where she\nbought me a £5,000 bag, and to a few other\ndesigner stores where we bought a couple of\ndresses, a pair of embroidered jeans and a pink\nsinglet, perfume and make-up.\n\nWe got back to Ghislaine’s house at around 4pm and | ran straight upstairs to shower and dress.\n\nWhen | went downstairs, Ghislaine and Jeffrey were in the lounge. There was a knock at the door.\nGhislaine led Andrew in and we kissed each other on the cheek. ‘Ghislaine served tea from a\nporcelain pot and biscuits. She knew Sarah Ferguson and they talked fondly about Andrew's\ndaughters.\n\nThen Ghislaine asked Andrew how old he thought | was and he guessed 17 and they all laughed.\nGhislaine made a joke that | was getting too old for Jeffrey.\n\nShe said, “He'll soon have to trade her in.” It was widely known that he liked young girls.’ The four of\nthem went out to dinner and on to Tramp nightclub where, she says, Andrew danced with her.\n\n‘After about an hour-and-a-half, we drove back to Ghislaine’s.\n\nCounselling: Virginia at her mother’s home at Palm\nBeach in 1998\n\nAll of us went upstairs and | asked Jeffrey to snap a picture of me with the Prince. | wanted\nsomething to show my Mom. Ghislaine and Jeffrey left us after that, and later Andrew left.\n\n‘In the morning, Ghislaine said, “You did well. He had fun\". We flew straight back to the States.’ The\nMail on Sunday has confirmed that the tycoon’s jet flew to Paris on March 6, 2001, continuing to\nGranada, Tangier and London, before returning to New York.\n\nOn the fast leg of the trip, Virginia was paid about $15,000 (£9,400) by Epstein. ‘It was amazing\nmoney, more than I'd ever made on a trip with him before.\n\nHe didn’t say there was any special reason, but | felt like I'd done everything he wanted. He was very\npleased.’\n\nThere is no suggestion that there was any sexual\ncontact between Virginia and Andrew, or that\n\nAndrew knew that Epstein paid her to have sex help me for get what | had to\nwith his friends.\n\ndo. It made me calm.\nHowever, the Prince must have been aware of\nEpstein’s conviction when he stayed with him in New York in December.\n\nVirginia says she met Andrew for a second time around Easter 2001 at Epstein’s Manhattan\nmansion.\n\n‘When | got fo the mansion, | was told, “Get ready. You are meeting someone in the office” — which\nis what they called the library. Andrew was sitting there in a big leather armchair.\n\n| took eight pills a day to\n\nGhislaine had just given him a present, a big toy that was his Spitting Image puppet. 'He was smiling\near-to-ear.
