  "text": "e Connectivity: Human neurons typically support several hundred connections\n(synapses). Moreover, the complex pattern of these connections is very\nmeaningful. (See our next point.) Computer units typically make only a handful\nof connections, in regular, fixed patterns.\n\ne Development (self-assembly with interactive sculpting): The human brain grows\nits units by cell divisions and orchestrates them into coherent structures by\nmovement and folding. It also proliferates an abundance of connections among\nthe cells. An important part of its sculpting occurs through active processes\nduring infancy and childhood, as the individual interacts with his or her\nenvironment. In this process, many connections are winnowed away, while others\nare strengthened, depending on their effectiveness in use. Thus, the fine structure\nof the brain is tuned through interaction with the external world—a rich source of\ninformation and feedback!\n\ne /ntegration (sensors and actuators): The human brain comes equipped with a\nvariety of sensory organs, notably including its outgrowth eyes, and with versatile\nactuators, including hands that build, legs that walk, and mouths that speak.\nThose sensors and actuators are seamlessy integrated into the brain’s information-\nprocessing centers, having been honed over millions of years of natural selection.\nWe interpret their raw signals and control their large-scale actions with minimal\nconscious attention. The flip side is that we don’t know how we do it, and the\nimplementation is opaque. It’s proving surprisingly difficult to reach human\nstandards on these “routine” input-output functions.\n\nThese advantages of human brains over currently engineered artifacts are\nprofound. Human brains supply an inspiring existence proof, showing us several ways\nwe can get more out of matter. When, if ever, will our engineering catch up?\n\nI don’t know for sure, but let me offer some informed opinions. The challenges\nof three-dimensionality and, to a lesser extent, self-repair don’t look overwhelming.\n\nThey present some tough engineering problems, but many incremental improvements are\neasy to imagine, and there are clear paths forward. And while the powers of human eyes,\nhands, and other sensory organs and actuators are wonderfully effective, their abilities are\nfar from exhausting any physical limits. Optical systems can take pictures with higher\nresolution in space, time, and color, and in more regions of the electromagnetic spectrum;\nrobots can move faster and be stronger; and so forth. In these domains, the components\nnecessary for superhuman performance, along many axes, are already available. The\nbottleneck is getting information into and out of them, rapidly, in the language of the\ninformation-processing units.\n\nAnd this brings us to the remaining, and I think most profound, advantages of\nbrains over artificial devices, which stem from their connectivity and interactive\ndevelopment. Those two advantages are synergistic, since it is interactive development\nthat sculpts the massively wired but sprawling structure of the infant brain, enabled by\nexponential growth of neurons and synapses, to get tuned into the extraordinary\ninstrument it becomes. Computer scientists are beginning to discover the power of the\nbrain’s architecture: Neural nets, whose basic design, as their name suggests, was directly\ninspired by the brain’s, have scored some spectacular successes in game playing and\npattern recognition, as noted. But present-day engineering has nothing comparable—in\n\n60\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016280",
