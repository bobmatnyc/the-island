So yes, Hamas, like al\nQaeda, talks of an Islamic government, but in practice it makes\ncompromises, as its unity agreement with Abbas and his regime\nsuggests. In power, Hamas has tried to Islamicize Gaza, and its rule\nin Gaza is notable for its repression, but it has not imposed a\ndraconian regime as did the Taliban in Afghanistan, the only\ngovernment al Qaeda ever recognized as truly Islamic.\n\nIn the end, Hamas is pragmatic. It makes compromises with rivals,\ncuts deals with potentially hostile foreign sponsors, and otherwise\ntries to strengthen its political position, even if this exposes it to the\ncharge of hypocrisy.\n\nNowhere is this more apparent that in Hamas's relations with Israel.\nEspecially since the 2008-2009 Cast Lead Operation, where Israeli\nforces hit Gaza hard, Hamas has often (though not always) adhered to\na ceasefire with Israel. In the months following Cast Lead, only a few\nrockets were launched at Israel from Gaza, and Israeli officials told\nme those were probably from other Palestinian groups or were\notherwise not an official Hamas action. Gazans did not want to go\nanother round with Israel's army, and Hamas feared alienating them.\nYet Hamas tries to maintain its street cred as a resistance\norganization. It has at times allowed other groups to launch attacks\non Israel, and in recent months launched missile salvos itself, risking\nan end to the de facto ceasefire. Internal pressures within Gaza,\nparticularly criticisms from Salafi-jihadists with ideologies akin to al\nQaeda, as well as Israeli attacks on Hamas personnel, have at times\nled the group to risk further retaliation, but this careful calculation is\na far cry from al Qaeda's call for constant struggle.\n\nHamas needs no reminder that al Qaeda is more foe than friend.\nThough Ismail Haniyeh, Hamas's leader in Gaza, praised bin Ladin\nafter his death as an \"Arab holy warrior,\" this was largely pandering\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023527",
