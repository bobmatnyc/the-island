Not only did\n, some of the girls have issues with\ndrugs or alcohol but also some had\ncriminal records and other troubies,\nEpstein’s legal team claimed. And at\nleast one of them, they said, fied\nwhen she told police she was\nyounger than 18 when she started\nperforming massages for Epstein.\n\nAfter the meeting, prosecutors\npostponed their decision to take the\ncase to a grand jury.\n\nIn the following weeks, police\nreceived complaints that two of the\nvictims or their families had been\nharassed or threatened. Epstein’s\nlegal team maintains that its private\ninvestigators did nothing illegal or\nunethical during their research.\n\nBy then, relations’ between\npolice and prosecutors were fraying.\nAt a key meeting with prosecutors\nand the defense, Detective Joseph\nRecarey, the lead investigator, was a\nno-show, according to Epstein’s\nattorney.\n\n“The embarrassment .on the\nprosecutor's face was evident when,\nthe police officer never showed up\n_for the meeting,” attorney Jack\nGoldberger said.\n\nLater in April, Recarey walked\ninto a prosecutor's office at the state\nattorney's office and learned the\ncase was taking an unexpected fim.\nThe prosecutor, Lanna\n' Belohlavek, told Recarey the state\nattorney’s office had offered Epstein\na plea deal that would not require\nhim to serve jail time or receive a\nfelony conviction.\n\nRecarey told her he disapproved\nof the plea offer.\n\nThe deal never came to pass,\nhowever.\n\nFuture unclear after charge\n\nOn May 1, the department asked\nprosecutors to approve warrants to\narrest Epstein on four counts of\n\nunlawful sexual activity with aminor -\n\nand to charge his personal assistant,\nSarah Kellen, now 27, for her alleged\nrole in arranging the visits. Police\nofficials also wanted to: charge Rob-\nson, the selfdescribed H.idi Fleiss,\nwith lewd and lascivious acts.\n\nBy then, the department was\nfrustrated with the way the state\nattorney's office had handled the\ncase. On the same day the warrants\nwere requested, Palm Beach Police\n. Chief Michael Reiter wrote a letter\nto State Attorney Barry Krischer\nsuggesting he disqualify himself\nfrom the case ifhe would not act. |\n\nTwo weeks later, Recarey was\ntold that prosecutors had decided |\nonce again to take the case to the\ngrand jury.\n\nItis not known how many of the\ngirls testified before the grand jury.\nBut Epstein’s defense team said one\ngirl who was subpoenaed — the one\nwho said she had sexual intercourse\nwith Epstein — never showed up.\n\nThe grand jury’s indictment was\nhanded down in July. It was not the\n\none the police department had .\n\nwanted\n\ncharge of unlawful sexual activity\nwith a minor, Epstein was charged\n\nwith one count of felony solicitation -\n\nof prostitution, which carries a\nmaximum penalty of five years in\nprison. He was booked into the Palm ,\nBeach County Jail early July 23 and |\nreleased hours later.\n\nEpstein’s legal team “doesn’t\ndispute that he had girls over for\n\nassages,” Goldberger said. But he\nsaid their claims that they had sex-\nual encounters with him lack credi- |\nbility.\n\n“They are. incapable of being\nbelieved,” he said. “They had crimi-\nnal records. They had accusations of\ntheft made against them by their |\nemployers. There was evidence of |\ndrug use by some-ofthem.” ~\n\nWhat remains for Epstein is yet\nto be seen.\n\nThe Palm Beach Police Depart-\nment has asked the FBI to investi-\ngate the case. It also has returned ©\nthe $90,000 Epstein donated in 2004.\n\nIn New York, candidates for\ngovernor and state attorney gene:\nhave vowed to return a total of at\nleast $60,000 in campaign contribu-\ntions from Epstein. Meanwhile,\nEpstein’s powerful friends have.\nremained silent as tabloids and\nInternet blogs feast on the public\ndetails of the police investigation. |\n\nGoldberger maintains Epstein’s\ninnocence but says the legal team\nhas not ruled out a future plea deal.\n\nHe insists Epstein will emerge in the\n\nend with his reputation untarnished.\n\n“He will recover from this,” he\nsaid. ‘\nStaff writer Larry Keller and staff\nyesearchers Bridget Buiger, Angelica\nCortez, Amy Hanaway and Melanie\nMena contributed to this story.\n\n@ andrew_marra@phpost.corit'\n\nInstead of being slapped with a -\n\n4\n\n03956-85\n\na\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019380",
