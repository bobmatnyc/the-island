However, domestic liquidity is likely to remain structurally tight, in\n\nour view. The NTP targeted increase in non-oil fiscal revenue is likely to tighten\n\ndomestic liquidity, all else being equal, as it would have the effect of extracting\n\nresources from the non-hydrocarbon private sector (as opposed to government\n\ndomestic spending that injects liquidity).\n\nLinked to liquidity trends and banking sector asset quality, the issue of government\narrears to contractors is likely to take centre stage, in our view. Resolving this is likely to\nbe required if the capex projects under the NTP are to be executed on a timely fashion,\nin our view. We think the government’s proposal to issue \"| Owe You' notes (IOUs) could\nbe a step in this direction.\n\nGovernment looks to issue |OUs\n\nAccording to the press, the Saudi government has paid contractors some cash on its\narrears, and is considering to issue \"| Owe You' notes (IOUs) to them. Contractors would\nreceive these notes to cover their outstanding dues, which they could hold until maturity\nor sell on to banks. The government has been highlighting it wanted to settle the\ncontractor sector dues, and recently a high-profile domestic contractor has made mass\nredundancies. In the previous downturn in the 1980s, arrears to domestic contractors\nwere also likely to have been accumulated. We highlighted that the fiscal deficit was\nlikely under-reported last year. Also, construction was one of the fastest growing sector\nlast year both in terms of domestic activity and of domestic credit.\n\n28 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016138",
