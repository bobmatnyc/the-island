  "text": "however, that the Preamble to the proposed regulation states that the proposed regulations\n“clarify that a disregarded entity is a person for purposes of Regulation 1.881-3,” implying that\nthe IRS does not need the proposed regulation's change to effect this result. 24 Consequently,\npractitioners practicing in this area should employ caution both before and after the proposed\nregulation becomes final.\n\nDual Consolidated Losses.\n\nThe dual consolidated loss (DCL) rules are generally intended to prevent companies with tax\nresidency in two different jurisdictions from using the same losses to obtain tax benefits in both\njurisdictions. The provisions in Section 1503(d), and the consolidated return regulations that\ndisallow the use of a DCL, generally treat a DRE as a separate entity. 2 An example of a DRE to\nwhich the DCL rules may apply is the so-called “hybrid entity,” which is an entity that is\ndisregarded for U.S. tax purposes but is subject to an entity-level income tax by a foreign\ncountry. “ The purpose of the DCL provisions, as applied to a domestic corporation that owns a\nhybrid entity, is to prevent a single net operating loss (NOL) generated by a DRE from being\nused in both the U.S. and in a foreign jurisdiction. ”\n\nThe DCL rules apply only to a dual resident corporation (DRC). A DRC is a domestic corporation\nor a separate unit of the domestic corporation (e.g., a hybrid entity that is a DRE for U.S. tax\npurposes) that is subject to U.S. tax on its worldwide income and a foreign jurisdiction's tax on\nits worldwide income or with respect to its separate unit's worldwide income. “ Without the\ngeneral disallowance of the DCL to the DRC, use of the DCL could occur in both the U.S. and the\nforeign jurisdiction because the DRC could offset its own income with the NOL generated by the\nDRE for U.S. tax purposes, and that NOL might also be used for foreign tax purposes against\nincome that may not be subject to U.S. tax. 7\n\nIn general, the DCL rules forbid a DRC from reducing the taxable income of any other member of\nits affiliated group by the amount of the DRE's DCL unless, as provided in the regulations, the\nloss does not offset the income of any foreign corporation. “ For purposes of determining the\nDCL, the DRE is treated as a separate entity and its income, deductions, gain, and loss are\ncomputed on a “stand alone” basis from the DRC that owns the DRE. ~ In that respect, the DRE\nis not treated as a disregarded entity.\n\nTreatment by Foreign Countries\n\nPractitioners should also be aware of the treatment of DREs by foreign countries. Canada, for\nexample, generally does not disregard U.S. SMLLCs; rather, it treats them as corporations. Also,\na grantor trust that is disregarded in the U.S. is respected as a trust in Canada. Some income\ntax treaties between the U.S. and foreign countries specifically address the treatment of\ndisregarded entities (also called “fiscally transparent” entities by some treaties).\n\nIn addition to some countries treating DREs differently than the U.S., the Code contains some\nprovisions that create special rules for certain DREs (or “fiscally transparent” entities). Section\n894 generally operates to deny certain treaty benefits to a “hybrid entity” (i.e., an entity treated\nas fiscally transparent for U.S. income tax purposes but recognized as a separate entity for\npurposes of the tax law of the foreign country). Under that section, income derived by a foreign\nperson through a fiscally transparent entity is denied the benefit of a reduced rate of withholding\ntax that an income tax treaty may provide if certain conditions are met. For instance, if a U.S.\ncompany makes an interest payment to an LLC that is wholly owned by a Canadian company,\nthe payment is generally subject to the full 30% withholding rate imposed by Code section\n1442(a) and is not entitled to the benefits of a reduced rate of withholding that the U.S./Canada\nincome tax treaty would otherwise permit.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026591",
