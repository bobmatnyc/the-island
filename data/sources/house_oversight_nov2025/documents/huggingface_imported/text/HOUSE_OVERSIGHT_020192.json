  "text": "40\n\nPutin then decided that this agent would be “welcome, provided, however, that he stops any kind\nof activity that could damage Russian-US relations.” Putin’s disclosure came as no surprise to the\nNSA investigation since the Russian pro-government newspaper Kommersant had reported that\nSnowden visited the Russian consulate in Hong Kong.\n\nPutin’s authorization could certainly account for Aeroflot waiving its usual passport and visa\ncheck to allow Snowden to board its plane. It also might explain the dispatch with which\nRussian officials whisked Snowden off the plane after it landed and into a waiting car at the\nMoscow airport. It could even account for Snowden’s vanishing from public view for the next\nthree weeks and the promulgation of the cover story that Snowden was unwillingly trapped at the\nairport by the U.S. government. The reasons behind Putin’s move were less clear.\n\nBy September 2013, the investigation was looking into a veritable abyss. Snowden’s culpability\nwas no longer an issue. What was lacking from the video, or the 2-hour film made from it by\nLaura Poitras, was any specific information on how many documents he had copied, how he had\nobtained the passwords to the computers on which they were stored, the period of time involved\nin the theft, or how he had breached all the security measures of the NSA in Hawaii. Nor would\nthat data be forthcoming from Snowden, who may be the only witness to the crime, By June 23,\n2013, he was in a safe haven in Moscow. Even though the Grand Jury case against Snowden\nwas cut and dry, it was also irrelevant because the US does not have an extradition treaty with\nRussia.\n\nThe purpose of the intelligence investigation went far beyond determining Snowden’s guilt or\ninnocence, however. Its job was to find out how such a massive theft of documents could occur\nhow the perpetrator escaped, and, perhaps most urgent, who had obtained the stolen documents\nfrom Snowden.\n\n2\n\nWhen Snowden first met Greenwald and Poitras in Hong Kong on June 3™ 2013, he displayed\nin his hand, as a recognition signal. It was an unsolved Rubik’s Cube. It may also be an\nappropriate metaphor for the unsolved elements in the Snowden enigma. Even in his later\ninterviews with journalists in Moscow, Snowden studiously avoided describing the means by\nwhich he breached the entire security regime of America’s most secret intelligence service. He\nonly told the journalists who came to Moscow to interview him, with a bit of pseudo-modesty,\nthat he was not “an angel” who descended from heaven to carry out the theft.\n\nBut the question of how Snowden stole these documents may be the most important part of the\nstory. The NSA, after all, furnishes communications intelligence to the President, his National\nSecurity advisers, and the Department of Defense that is supposedly derived from secret sources\nin adversary nations. If these adversary nations learn about the NSA’s sources, the information, if\nnot worthless, cannot be fully trusted. The most basic mission of the NSA is to protect its\nsources. Yet, despite all its efforts, Snowden walked away with long lists of its sources. In doing\nso, he amply demonstrated that a single civilian employee working for an outside contractor, even\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020192",
