  "text": "2]\n\nthe north, Israel's territory never stretched as far as Damascus,\nalthough it frequently held the Golan Heights. Israel extended many\ntimes to both sides of the Jordan but never deep into the Jordanian\nDesert. It never extended southeast into the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nIsrael consists generally of three parts. First, it always has had the\nnorthern hill region, stretching from the foothills of Mount Hermon\nsouth to Jerusalem. Second, it always contains some of the coastal\nplain from today's Tel Aviv north to Haifa. Third, it occupies area\nbetween Jerusalem and the Jordan River — today's West Bank. At\ntimes, it controls all or part of the Negev, including the coastal region\nbetween the Sinai to the Tel Aviv area. It may be larger than this at\nvarious times in history, and sometimes smaller, but it normally holds\nall or part of these three regions.\n\nIsrael is well-buffered in three directions. The Sinai Desert protects it\nagainst the Egyptians. In general, the Sinai has held little attraction\nfor the Egyptians. The difficulty of deploying forces in the eastern\nSinai poses severe logistical problems for them, particularly during a\nprolonged presence. Unless Egypt can rapidly move through the Sinai\nnorth into the coastal plain, where it can sustain its forces more\nreadily, deploying in the Sinai is difficult and unrewarding.\nTherefore, so long as Israel is not so weak as to make an attack on the\ncoastal plain a viable option, or unless Egypt is motivated by an\noutside imperial power, Israel does not face a threat from the\nsouthwest.\n\nIsrael is similarly protected from the southeast. The deserts southeast\nof Eilat-Agaba are virtually impassable. No large force could\napproach from that direction, although smaller raiding parties could.\nThe tribes of the Arabian Peninsula lack the reach or the size to pose\na threat to Israel, unless massed and aligned with other forces. Even\nthen, the approach from the southeast is not one that they are likely to\ntake. The Negev is secure from that direction.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031860",
