This is not a cure for employer\nintimidation, * * * but it is a step in the\nright direction.\n\n—As an employee at will, | was not aware\nof my rights to form a union or any rights\nthat I may have had under the NLRA.®\n\n—I worked in the construction materials\ntesting industry for about eight years.\nDuring that time I had no idea I had the\nright to join a union.®\n\n—As a working class citizen, | am well aware\nof just how rare it is for my fellow workers\nto know their rights. For that reason, this\nis arule that is extremely overdue. * * *.\n\nA sampling of comments from labor\nattorneys, workers’ organizations, and\nlabor organizations is consistent with\nthese employees’ comments:\n\n—It is my experience that upwards of 95%\nof employees have no idea what their\nrights are with respect to labor unions.®\n\n—In fact, [have had many employees over\nthe years tell me that their employers have\ntold them that they do not allow unions at\ntheir workplace.®\n\n—Workers today do not know what their\nrights are under the NLRA. As a Union\norganizer with more than 20 years of\nexperience, without exception, every\nworker | encounter thinks that it is\nperfectly legal for their employer to fire\nthem simply for saying the word union, or\neven to speak with other employees at\nwork about general working conditions.\nThe protections afforded workers to engage\nin protected concerted activity around\nworkplace issues is unknown to the\nmajority of workers today.®*\n\n—It is the experience of [Service Employees\nInternational Union (SEIU) Local 615] that\nmany employees are woefully unaware of\ntheir rights under the NLRA and that that\nlack of knowledge makes employees\nvulnerable when they desire to address\ntheir wages and working conditions with\nthe employers.®7\n\n—I have participated in hundreds of\norganizing campaigns involving thousands\nof employees. In my experience, most\npeople had no idea what their rights were\nto organize or join unions.®\n\nSome unions also assert that even\nunionized employees often do not have\na clear understanding of the NLRA. One\nunion staff representative writes that\n“there seems to be a disconnect, most of\nour membership does not know a thing\nabout NLRA.”’ 6° Another union steward\ncomments similarly:\n\nI saw how union members were often\nunaware of their rights unless the union\n\n62 Comment of International Staff Representative,\nSteelworkers.\n\n63 Comment of Member, Local 150, Operating\nEngineers.\n\n64 Comment of Organizer, Local 150, Operating\nEngineers.\n\n65 Comment of Strokoff and Cowden.\n\n66 Comment of Organizer, Teamsters, Local 117.\n\n®7Comment of SEIU Local 615.\n\n68 Comment of Financial Secretary, Local 150,\nOperating Engineers.\n\n69 Comment of Staff Representative, Steelworkers.\n\nspecifically did outreach and member\neducation, or unless the employee ran into a\nproblem and came to a steward for\nassistance. * * *\n\nNotice to employees, however, could\nprovide a starting point for those employees\nto try to assert rights that they currently have\non paper but often do not have in practice.\n\nSeveral immigrant workers’\norganizations comment on the difficulty\nthat this population has in\nunderstanding their rights and accessing\nthe proper help when needed.7° These\norganizations note that laws in the\nimmigrants’ home countries may be\nquite different from those of the United\nStates, and the high barrier that lack of\nfluency in English creates in making\nthese persons aware of their rights\nunder the NLRA.”! These organizations\nalso contend that because guestworkers\nin particular can work only for the\nemployer that requested their visa, they\nare extremely vulnerable to labor\nviolations, and that these employers\nroutinely misrepresent the existence of\nNLRA rights.”72 The National Day\nLaborers Organizing Network claims\nthat ‘‘most workers are not aware of\ntheir right to organize.”’\n\nOne immigrant construction worker,\ncommenting favorably on the proposed\nrule, explains that she learned English\nafter coming to the United States from\nPoland: “While working as a testing\ntechnician, I had no idea I had the right\nto join a union.” She writes:\n\nI think a government written notice posted\nin the workplace would be a critical source\nof information for employees who want to\njoin a union. Especially in this industry\nwhere many people like myself are foreign\nborn, there is a language barrier that adds to\nthe difficulty in understanding our legal\nrights. I take government posted notices\nseriously and believe other people do as\nwell.73\n\nSignificantly, the Board received\nnumerous comments opposing the rule\nprecisely because the commenters\nbelieve that the notice will increase the\nlevel of knowledge about the NLRA on\nthe part of employees. Specifically, they\npredict that the rule will lead to\nincreased unionization and create\nalleged adverse effects on employers\nand the economy generally. For\nexample, Baker and Daniels LLP\ncomments that as more employees\nbecome aware of their NLRA rights, they\nwill file more unfair labor practice\n\n70 See e.g., comments of National Immigration\nLaw Center and Latino Justice.\n\n71 See, e.g., comment of Friends of Farmworkers,\nInc.\n\n72 Comment of Alliance of Guestworkers for\nDignity.\n\n73 Comment of Instructor, Apprenticeship and\nSkill Improvement Program, Local 150, Operating\nEngineers.\n\ncharges and elect unions to serve as\ntheir collective-bargaining\nrepresentatives. But fear that employees\nmay exercise their statutory rights is not\na valid reason for not informing them of\ntheir rights.\n\nMoreover, the NLRA protects the right\nto join a union and to refrain from doing\nso and the notice so states. In addition,\nthe NLRA confers and protects other\nrights besides the right to join or refrain\nfrom joining unions. Section 7 provides\nthat employees have the right “to engage\nin other concerted activities for the\npurpose of collective bargaining or other\nmutual aid or protection[.]’’ Such\nprotected concerted activities include\nconcertedly complaining or petitioning\nto management concerning their terms\nand conditions of employment; 74\nconcertedly petitioning government\nconcerning matters of mutual interest in\nthe workplace; 75 and concertedly\nrefusing to work under poor working\nconditions.’® Few if any of the\ncomments contending that employees\nknow about their NLRA rights assert\nthat employees are aware of the right to\nengage in such protected concerted\nactivities in the nonunion setting. By\ncontrast, as shown above, many\ncomments favoring the rule report that\nnonunion employees are especially\nunlikely to be aware of their NLRA\nrights.\n\nAlthough some comments contend\nthat the articles cited by the Board in\nsupport of its belief that employees are\nlargely unaware of the NLRA rights are\nold and inadequately supported,’” they\ncite no more recent or better supported\nstudies to the contrary. In addition, the\npercentage of the private sector\nworkforce represented by unions has\ndeclined from about 12 percent in 1989,\nabout the time the articles cited in the\nNPRM were published, to 8 percent\npresently; 78 thus, to the extent that lack\nof contact with unions contributed to\nlack of knowledge of NLRA rights 20\nyears ago, it probably is even more of a\nfactor today.’\n\n74 North Carolina License Plate Agency #18, 346\nNLRB 293 (2006), enf’d. 243 F.
