The Education Market\n\nEducation is one of the largest sectors in the world, representing approximately 5% of global gross\nnational income of $48 trillion.'’ In 2005 in the U.S. alone, education was a $1.0 trillion market with for-\nprofit education accounting for $81 billion or 7.8% of this amount.\"® The for-profit component of this\nindustry (pre-K-12, post secondary and corporate training) is projected to grow faster than the overall\nhistorical industry growth rate, at a 7.4% annual rate, reflecting the increasing importance of for-profit\noperations in the sector, to reach a market size of $116 billion by 2010.'® Education is still predominantly\nprovided by public / governmental entities in most countries including the U.S. KUE believes that the\nindustry will converge towards a more balanced public / private system, similar to the evolution observed\nin the 20th century in other major industries such as healthcare, infrastructure and telecommunications.\n\nUS Education Industry: Revenues Generated by For-Profit Companies (1999—2010E)\n$150 10.0%\n\nos\n~ HD 9.0% &\n5 $90 8.0% 3\n= $60 7.0% ¥\n~ $30 6.0% 2\n\n$0 5.0% &\n\n1999 2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 2005E 2006E 2007E 2008E 2009E 2010E\nmmm For-Profit Spending =illFor-Profit %\n\nSource: Harris Nesbitt estimates, U.S. Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics, Training Magazine and\nEduventures.\n\n8.3. The U.S. Early Childcare or “pre-K” Market\n\nThe highly fragmented early childcare or “pre-K” market includes care based in homes and housed by\ncommunity organizations (e.g., churches, synagogues, YMCAs) and center based facilities. Center-\nbased childcare includes preschools (nurseries), workplace centers (located on-site at the company),\nlease-model centers (located in a real estate developer's office building), back-up centers (a variety of on-\nsite and off-site back-up care programs) and family day-care facilities (located in someone’s home or\ncenter). Although childcare may evoke thoughts of a babysitting service, education has become an\nincreasingly important element in services to pre-K children. However, the education-focused portion of\nthe childcare market remains relatively small.\n\nSince the early 1980s, center-based ECE has become the care provider of choice for families. The U.S.\nECE unit generated an estimated $54 billion in total spending in 2005, representing a 10% compound\nannual growth rate since 1982.\" Approximately five million or 60% of 3 to 5-year-olds with working\nmothers are enrolled in ECE centers.*° The following growth drivers are expected to continue to fuel\ngrowth in the early childcare market: growing importance of ECE, demographics (e.g., more children aged\nfive and younger), increase in families with two working parents, more educated parents, corporations\nrecognizing the benefits of childcare services and tax incentives and other positive legislation.\n\nThe perception of ECE as a fundamental component of child development has contributed to average\nannual fee increases of roughly 7% amongst center-based facilities, reflecting the stable, relatively\ninelastic nature of the demand for higher quality care.*‘ The number of children receiving childcare\n\n” Source: UNESCO Institute for Statistics Database.\n\n7 Source: US Department of Education National Center for Education Statistics and Training Magazine and Harris Nesbitt research.\n\n?
