  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54007\n\nFederal labor and employment laws in\nnot requiring employers routinely to\npost notices at their workplaces\ninforming employees of their statutory\nrights.6 Given this common practice of\nworkplace notice-posting, it is\nreasonable for the Board to infer that a\nposting requirement will increase\nemployees’ awareness of their rights\nunder the NLRA.’ Further support for\nthat position is President Obama’s\nrecent Executive Order 13496, issued on\nJanuary 30, 2009, which stressed the\nneed for employees to be informed of\ntheir NLRA rights. Executive Order\n13496 requires Federal contractors and\nsubcontractors to include in their\nGovernment contracts specific\nprovisions requiring them to post\nnotices of employees’ NLRA rights. On\nMay 20, 2010, the Department of Labor\nissued a Final Rule implementing the\norder effective June 21, 2010. 75 FR\n28368, 29 CFR part 471.\n\nAfter due consideration, the Board\nhas decided to require that employees of\nall employers subject to the NLRA be\ninformed of their NLRA rights.\nInforming employees of their statutory\nrights is central to advancing the\nNLRA’s promise of “full freedom of\nassociation, self-organization, and\ndesignation of representatives of their\nown choosing.” NLRA Section 1, 29\nU.S.C. 151. It is fundamental to\nemployees’ exercise of their rights that\nthe employees know both their basic\nrights and where they can go to seek\nhelp in understanding those rights.\nNotice of the right of self-organization,\nto form, join, or assist labor\norganizations, to bargain collectively, to\nengage in other concerted activities, and\nto refrain from such activities, and of\nthe Board’s role in protecting those\nstatutory rights is necessary to effectuate\nthe provisions of the NLRA.\n\nThe Board believes that the workplace\nitself is the most appropriate place for\ncommunicating with employees about\ntheir basic statutory rights as employees.\nCf. Eastex, Inc. v. NLRB, 437 U.S. 556,\n574 (1978) (“[T]he plant is a particularly\nappropriate place for the distribution of\n[NLRA] material.’’).\n\nAccordingly, and pursuant to its\nrulemaking authority under Section 6 of\nthe NLRA, the Board proposed a new\nrule requiring all employers subject to\nthe NLRA to post a copy of a notice\nadvising employees of their rights under\n\n6 See, e.g., Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of\n1964, 42 U.S.C. 2000e-10(a); Age Discrimination in\nEmployment Act, 29 U.S.C. 627; Family and\nMedical Leave Act, 29 U.S.C. 2601, 2619(a); Fair\nLabor Standards Act, 29 CFR 516.4 (implementing\n29 U.S.C. 211). 75 FR 80411.\n\n7 As set forth in the NPRM, two petitions were\nfiled to address this anomaly. 75 FR 80411.\n\nthe NLRA and providing information\npertaining to the enforcement of those\nrights. 75 FR 80411. For the reasons\ndiscussed more fully below, the Board\ntentatively determined that the content\nof the notice should be the same as that\nof the notice required under the\nDepartment of Labor’s notice posting\nrule, 29 CFR part 471. Id. at 80412. Also,\nas discussed at length below, the Board\nproposed that failure to post the notice\nwould be found to be an unfair labor\npractice—i.e., to interfere with, restrain,\nor coerce employees in the exercise of\ntheir NLRA rights, in violation of\nSection 8(a)(1) of the NLRA. Id. at\n80414. The Board also proposed that\nfailure to post the notice could lead to\ntolling of the 6-month statute of\nlimitations for filing unfair labor\npractice charges, and that knowing and\nwillful failure to post the notice could\nbe considered as evidence of unlawful\nmotive in unfair labor practice cases. Id.\nThe Board explained that the burden of\ncompliance would be minimal—the\nnotices would be made available at no\ncharge by the Board (both electronically\nand in hard copy), and employers\nwould only be required to post the\nnotices in places where they\ncustomarily post notices to employees;\nthe rule would contain no reporting or\nrecordkeeping requirements. Id. at\n80412. Finally, the Board expressed its\nposition that it was not required to\nprepare an initial regulatory flexibility\nanalysis of the proposed rule under the\nRegulatory Flexibility Act, 5 U.S.C. 601\net seq., and that the notice posting\nrequirement was not subject to the\nPaperwork Reduction Act, 44 U.S.C.\n3501 et seq. Id. at 80415-80416.\n\nThe Board invited comments on its\nlegal authority to issue the rule, the\ncontent of the notice, the requirements\nfor posting the notice, the proposed\nenforcement scheme, the definitions of\nterms in the proposed rule, and on its\npositions concerning the Regulatory\nFlexibility Act and the Paperwork\nReduction Act. The Board stated that\ncomments would be accepted for 60\ndays following the publication of the\nNPRM in the Federal Register, or until\nFebruary 22, 2011. The Board received\n6,560 comments by February 22.\nHowever, many late-filed comments\nwere also submitted, and the Board\ndecided to accept all comments that it\nreceived on or before March 23.8\n\n8 March 23, 2011 was the date that the Board\ndownloaded all of the electronic and (pdf. versions\nof} hard copy comments it had received from\nhttp://www.regulations.gov and subsequently\nuploaded into a text analytics tool for coding and\nreview.\n\nA few commenters submitted their comments in\nboth electronic and hard copy form. Because all\n\nIn all, 7,034 comments were received\nfrom employers, employees, unions,\nemployer organizations, worker\nassistance organizations, and other\nconcerned organizations and\nindividuals, including two members of\nCongress. The majority of comments, as\nwell as Board Member Hayes’ dissent,\noppose the rule or aspects of it; many\nopposing comments contain suggestions\nfor improvement in the event the Board\nissues a final rule. Many comments,\nhowever, support the rule; a few of\nthose suggest changes to clarify or\nstrengthen the rule. The Board wishes to\nexpress its appreciation to all those who\ntook the time to submit thoughtful and\nhelpful comments and suggestions\nconcerning the proposed rule.®\n\nAfter careful consideration of the\ncomments received, the Board has\ndecided to issue a final rule that is\nsimilar to that proposed in the NPRM,\nbut with some changes suggested by\ncommenters. The most significant\nchange in the final rule is the deletion\nof the requirement that employers\ndistribute the notice via email, voice\nmail, text messaging or related\nelectronic communications if they\ncustomarily communicate with their\nemployees in that manner. Other\nsignificant changes include\nclarifications of the employee notice\ndetailing employee rights protected by\nthe NLRA and unlawful conduct on the\npart of unions; clarification of the rule’s\nrequirements for posting notices in\nforeign languages; allowing employers\nto post notices in black and white as\nwell as in color; and exemption of the\nU.S. Postal Service from coverage of the\nrule. The Board’s responses to the\ncomments, and the changes in the rule\nand in the wording of the required\nnotice of employee rights occasioned by\nthe comments, are explained below. (In\nhis dissent, Board Member Hayes raises\na number of points that are also made\nin some of the comments. The Board’s\nresponses to those comments should be\nunderstood as responding to the dissent\nas well.) 1°\n\ncomments received are included in the numbers\ncited in text above, those numbers overstate\nsomewhat the number of individuals, organizations,\netc. that submitted comments.\n\n®° Many comments charge that the Board is issuing\nthe rule for political reasons, to encourage and\nspread unionism, to discourage employers and\nemployees from engaging in direct communication\nand problem solving, to drive up union\nmembership in order to retain agency staff, and\neven to “line [its] pockets.” The Board responds\nthat its reasons for issuing the rule are set forth in\nthis preamble.\n\n10 The Board majority’s reasoning stands on its\nown. By its silence, the majority does not adopt any\ncharacterization made by the dissent of the\nmajority’s rationale or motives.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022278",
