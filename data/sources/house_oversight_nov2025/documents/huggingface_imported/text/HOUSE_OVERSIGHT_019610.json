This ubiquitous surveillance of virtually every non-cash\ntransaction came about because of advances in computer technology\nthat made it economically feasible to mine such data.\n\nSnowden’s concern about NSA domestic surveillance is certainly\nnot misplaced. Ever since the 9/11 attacks, the NSA has increasingly\nplayed a role in this surveillance state, not by its own choice, but\nbecause Congress mandated it. In 2001, it empowered the NSA to\nobtain and archive data on American citizens. Accordingly, the NSA\nobtained the billing records of customers from phone and Internet\ncompanies and archived these records. The bulk collection of these\nbilling records was intended to build a searchable database for the\ngovernment that could be used to trace the history of the telephone\nand Internet activities in the United States of FBI-designated foreign\nterrorists and spies abroad. The government’s rationale for keeping\nthese anti-terrorist programs secret from the public was that it did\nnot want the foreign suspects to realize their communications in\nAmerica were being monitored.\n\n© The public only learned that the phone company was routinely ©\nturning over its billing records on June 6, 2013, when Snowden dis-\nclosed it to The Guardian and The Washington Post. The documents\nhe provided the journalists showed that the NSA had been obtain-\ning phone records collected by Verizon every three months. While\nthis revelation might have shocked the American public, the NSA\nhad not acted on its own. It had acted under a warrant issued by a\nsecret court established by Congress in 1978 as part of the Foreign\nIntelligence Surveillance Act for each request for records. Congress\nempowered the FISA court, whose judges are appointed by the pres-\nident, to hear cases and authorize search warrants in secret in cases\ninvolving national security.\n\nAs its name implies, the FISA court was meant to deal with matters\nbearing on foreign intelligence activities in the United States. That\nrestriction changed after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001.\nA month after the attacks, Congress expanded the purview of the\nFISA court by passing the USA Patriot Act (an acronym that stands\nfor Uniting and Strengthening America by Providing Appropriate\nTools Required to Intercept and Obstruct Terrorism).
