  "text": "the Middle East's Islamists, and specifically\nthe Muslim brotherhood, whom the Qataris\nview as the region's rising power. \"The\nQatari strategy is that the situation has\nchanged, and we need to fend for ourselves\nand ensure that the regional anarchy is not\ngoing to impact us,\" says Bokhari. The\nQatari investment in Rawabi -- which feeds\nan $85 million investment in the Israeli\neconomy, and which could not have\nhappened without some degree of official\nIsraeli approval -- is an example of this\nlarger geopolitical strategy, which is driven\nmore by perceived self-interest than by an\nideological affinity for political Islam.\n\n\"Investments in the region are about the\nreturn on political influence,\" adds Gregory\nGause, a professor at the University of\nVermont and a non-resident senior fellow\nat the Brookings Institution-Doha. He\nnoted the presence of a large American\nairbase in Qatar, and the country's close\nrelations with the United States.\n\nIn the Palestinian territories, as in the\nbroader region, the Qataris are supporting\nsecular and religious forces in a way that\nwill maximize their influence and keep the\nregional balance as favorable for them as\npossible. In a sense, the same strategic\ncalculus that convinces Qatar to support\nHamas allows them to cooperate with Israel\nand the West Bank private sector as well.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025088",
