  "text": "So though no inherent enmity exists between the two countries, a crack emerges.\nEach side finds reasons not to cooperate. A shared interest in peace - neither side\nwants a collision, both understand the costs - is shimmied apart by a perception\ngap. Cultural, historical, temperamental and ideological differences accelerate the\nunzipping of even the best intentions. Misunderstanding bends and then snaps\nirrevocably into mistrust. So yes, the recovered islands and the trade tensions and\nthe political theories have to be managed because each is a blister that limits\nforward motion - but the real source of friction? It is the scraping of different world\nviews. This is deep strategic misalignment. It is, in fact, the stuff of war.\n\nIn recent years, America has had two different, nearly opposite approaches to China,\neach however marked by an assured national confidence that the current world\norder is sustainable. One policy is short-handed as “engagement” - or, colloquially,\n“panda hugging.” As China becomes more prosperous, this approach suggests, she\nwill become more congenial to American interests. More cuddly. This was, for some,\nthe basis for bringing China into the World Trade Organization in the 1990s. Later it\njustified deep commercial links and educational ties. The logic of such an approach\nfit the mindset of many baby-boomer Americans: China’s attraction to MTV,\nMcDonalds and Mercedes hinted at a still deeper desire they thought. To be\nWestern. China’s citizens would surely become more attracted and committed to the\nworld system that had delivered all this prosperity. The country would become\nmore global, in a sense, and /ess Chinese.\n\nIn fact, as China has grown in recent years she has become more global and more\nChinese. Growth, wealth, an admixture of confidence into the old national habit of\ninsecurity - all of these have encouraged a searching exploration. The demands of\ndomestic politics, the instincts of the Chinese Communist Party and the inevitable\npractical questions of security and reform all produce sensible questions. China\nneeds oil, for instance. Must she project power into the Middle East? Control the sea\nlanes of the Malacca Straits? There’s no natural, inherent resistance to American\ninterests in any one problem, but that hopeful American logic of “engagement”\nignores much about China’s essence. The country presses at rules she mistrusts (as\nAmerica once did). She struggles with the inevitable challenges of a political system\nstill smoking a bit from recent revolutions - and, of course, facing the pressures of a\nnetworked age. But she holds, strongly, a sense of Chineseness. Can we honestly\nexpect to use mere prosperity to change China in a predictable, pro-American way?\n“Engagement” feels to Chinese like a demand to become more American. That\nprospect is as appealing as a request to become more Chinese would be for\nAmericans.\n\nAn alterative strategy to “engagment” is known as “containment”. (While not\nformally called “Panda Kicking”, this is often what this policy looks like.) This view\ntakes it for granted that as China becomes more powerful she will become a threat.\nAny growth in Chinese power means a decline in America’s influence and security. A\nstronger China in Asia, for instance, means a weaker America. Countries like Japan\nor Korea or the Philippines will be required to choose a side at some point, at some\nawful 21st Century Melian moment. The aim of containment is to squelch China\n\n179\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018411",
