  "text": "Notes\n\nPRoLoGuE Snowden’s Trail: Hong Kong, 2014\n\n3, “No Such Agency”: The best description of the birth of the NSA can be found in\nBamford, Puzzle Palace, 1-4.\n\n4 the NSA learned: General Keith Alexander, interview with author.\n\n4 twelve-minute video: This video can be seen at http://www.theguardian.com\n/world/video/2013/jun/09/nsa-whistleblower-edward-snowden-interview\n-video. All of the dozens of videos Snowden made after this initial one can be\nviewed in chronological order at https://nsa.gov1.info/dni/snowden.html.\n\n© 5 Ihad written several books: My book Inquest examined the failure of the FBI, ©\n\nthe Secret Service, and the CIA to establish the context of the John F. Kennedy\nassassination. This interest continued in other books of mine, including Decep-\ntion, in which I investigated the vulnerability of intelligence services involved in\nespionage during the Cold War, and Agency of Fear (New York: G. P. Putnam’s\nSons, 1977), in which I explored intelligence failures of domestic intelligence in\nthe war on drugs.\n\n5 extradite Trent Martin: The FBI press statement on this case was released\non March 27, 2013, less than two months before Snowden bought his ticket\nfor Hong Kong: https://www.fbi.gov/newyork/press-releases/2013/australian\n-research-analyst-extradited-on-insider-trading-charges.\n\n6 “It’s very mysterious”: Hayden, interview with author.\n\n6 My first surprise: I interviewed six members of the Mira staff, all of whom asked\nme not to identify them. Te-Ping Chen, a journalist for the Asian edition of\nThe Wall Street Journal, received similar replies when she interviewed Mira\nhotel employees the day Snowden left the Mira. Chen and Brown, “Snowden’s\nOptions for Refuge Narrow.”\n\n6 to send Greenwald: Greenwald’s description of his encounters with Snowden\nis taken mainly from chapter 1, “Contact,” and chapter 2, “Ten Days in Hong\nKong,” in Greenwald, No Place to Hide, 7-32.\n\n7 Snowden also contacted: Gellman, “Code Name ‘Verax.’”\n\n7 He proposed we meet: Bradsher, interview with author. Bradsher wrote a number\nof excellent articles about Snowden and Ho. See Bradsher, “Hasty Exit Started\nwith Pizza Inside a Hong Kong Hideout.”\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 307 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019795",
