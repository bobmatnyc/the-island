The public should be outraged it\nhas gone as far as it has.\"\n\nBrad Edwards, a second attorney representing the women, has seen the sealed deal after a federal judge allowed\nhim and his clients to view it, but would not discuss its contents.\n\nEdwards would say only that the women were \"outraged\" that it had been negotiated behind their backs.\nA reporter asked Edwards whether he thought Epstein received special treatment by federal prosecutors.\n\"Are you kidding? It's transparent. Certainly, no one else gets treated like that,\" Edwards said.\n\nEpstein, 56, a reported money manager of billionaires, is serving an 18-month sentence in the Palm Beach County\nStockade after pleading guilty almost a year ago in state court to felony solicitation of prostitution and procuring teen-\nagers for prostitution. Epstein is allowed out, though, each day from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m., a Sheriff's Office spokesman\nsaid.\n\nDispleased with the way the State Attorney's Office handled the case, Palm Beach police forwarded information to\nthe FBI.\n\nINFORMATIONAL BOX:\n\nYoung women have sued.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013426",
