Hi Marty,

The attached lawsuit was filed this week in federal court in California alleging that Jeffrey Epstein and another
man, Donald Trump, raped her in 1994. We’re planning to publish a story on the suit this afternoon, and we
want to make sure it is fair. Is Mr. Epstein available to speak? Or do you want to offer a comment on this
behalf?

My number | and I’m available any time. I also just tried your cell phone.
Thank you in advance.
