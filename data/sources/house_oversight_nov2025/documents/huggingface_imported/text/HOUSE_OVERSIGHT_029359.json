  "text": "The 1* lesson: \"Be modest in\nprophecy\". In particular, when it comes\nto the future. Mubarak for example had\nabout 400,000 people at his disposal\nworking in various security agencies in\norder to preemptively predict events\nsuch as those that took place at Tahrir\nSquare. And he did not foresee the\nuprising. So who can?\n\nThe 2\" lesson: When friends, and even\nthe leaders among us, say: \"Don't get\nswept into a panic — 1f something really\ngrave happens (Iran for example) — the\nUS will not stand by. The world will\ntake action!\"\n\nAnd I say: Don't bet on it. Look at Syria.\nAssad has massacred 200,000 of his own\npeople — with tanks, artillery, fighter\njets, even chemical weapons — and the\n\nworld did not lift a finger.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029359",
