EU BANKS: BIG EQUITY OUTFLOWS BUT REMAIN UPBEAT ON REFLATION TRADE

Spec Sales Comment:

BofAML SESE See ee oe oe eee outflows in 40 weeks and first
outflows YTD (click here). Our BofAML Bull & Bear Indicator is now at 7.1, the highest level since Jul'14
and not far from "sell" signal. So is this just a pause for breath in the reflation trade? BofAML strategists

think so. In our updated thoughts this morning we think reflation is real so stay long equities, short rates,
selectively long USD (click here).

Bearish Bullish

The main reasons for equity investor concern in recent weeks = the gap between hard and soft data, plus
the delay in the Trump fiscal package
