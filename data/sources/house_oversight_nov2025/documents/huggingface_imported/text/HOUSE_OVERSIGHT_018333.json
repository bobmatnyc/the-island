  "text": "Software and hardware manufacturers usually struggle to keep such exploits secret\nuntil they can deliver a fix, but this doesn’t always work. Secrets get out. And,\nanyhow, even once a patch is developed, it can take weeks or months before it’s\nwidely installed. It’s not uncommon, therefore, that within hours of the\nannouncement of a newly found zero day, attacks using that method explode around\nthe net. Thousands of hackers try to take advantage of the vulnerability, to kick at\nthe defensive corners of systems while they are down for repair or restart - or\nsimply left vulnerable by slower-witted system administrators who don’t yet know\nthat it is now open hunting season on a particular bit of code. Heartbleed, a “zero\nday” that permitted hackers to slip into your computer via holes in website and\nbrowser security, was disclosed to the world on April 7, 2014 - more than two years\nafter it had apparently been put in place because of a programming error.\nAccidentally? By an overworked engineer? Deliberately? By some state security\nagency? In any event, two days after it was announced and long before it had been\nfully patched, attacks using the method grew from a few dozen per hour to millions\nas hackers tried to suck data from unsecured networks.1*° The exponential power of\na connected system is as apparent in sickness as in health.\n\n4,\n\nIn recent years, hacking has moved deeper still, beyond the level of software and\nUSB drives and into the very atomic level of computers, the places where the\nelectrons that make up bits and bytes float. The technical elegance of these micro-\nlevel hacks has been, often, breathtaking - exploits that look like Wagnerian operas\ncompared to the Cap’n Crunch’s thin, reedy weird-machine whistle. As companies\nlike Intel and AMD began packing more memory cells on silicon wafers, for example,\nthey noticed magnetic interference flowing across the surface of their chips like\nwaves. Electrical signals, recall, have a magnetic element, so more tiny digital cells,\ncloser together, is like a bow] of interacting magnets. Physics would have predicted\nsuch a result. In 2014 security researchers Mark Seaborn and Thomas Dullien, who\nworked at Google, discovered that they could use the magnetic vibrations on two\nparallel rows of memory chips to flip the electrical state of a third row - sort of like\nusing a magnet under a table to move a paperclip around — in a way that the system\nmight never notice!*!. This permitted them to reach “off limits”, super secure areas\nof the machine’s memory where they could do what they wanted. They called the\nbreak, “Rowhammer’” and it represented an ideal and essentially unfixable hole that\naffected nearly every small chipset made for a half a decade. They published the\n\ntechnical consideration about modern computing systems. See also Rebecca\nShapiro, Sergey Bratus and Sean W. Smith, ““Weird Machines” in ELF: A Spotlight on\nthe Underappreciated Metadata”, paper published online by Bratus.\n\n140 In any event: Leyla Bilge, Tudor Dumitras, “Before We Knew It: An Empirical\nStudy of Zero-Day Attacks In the Real World,“ Paper presented at ACM CCS ’12, Oct\n16-18, 2012, p 10\n\n41 Jn 2014: Mark Seaborn and Thomas Dullien, “Exploiting the DRAM rowhammer\nbug to gain kernel privileges”, March 18. 2015, Google Project Zero blog\n\n101\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018333",
