Nothing in the rule, however, would bar the defendant from requesting that\ninformation by filing an appropriate motion. The court could then determine whether any such motion had merit. !7°\n\n[*874]\nRule 15 - Victims’ Right To Attend Pre-Trial Depositions\nThe Proposal:\n\nRule 15 should allow victims to attend any public deposition in a case as follows:\n\n(i) Victims Can Attend. A Victim can attend any public deposition taken under this rule under the same conditions as govern a\nvictim's attendance at trial.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nVictims have the right \"not to be excluded from any ... public court proceeding,\" except in rare cases where their testimony\n\n178 and\n\nwill be materially affected. '’7 Depositions authorized by Rule 15 are for the purpose of preserving evidence for trial,\nthus are effectively an extension of the trial. Victims accordingly have the right to attend such proceedings, if public, under the\nsame conditions governing their attendance at trial. To avoid any confusion over this issue, the proposed rule change directly\n\nstates that conclusion.\n\nBecause victims can be excluded from the trial in certain rare situations where their testimony would be materially affected,\n'79 they can likewise be excluded from a deposition in those situations. The proposed rule simply applies the limitations on\nattending trial to the deposition setting by providing that the \"same conditions\" apply to the victim's attendance at the\n\ndeposition.\n\n[*875]\n\nRule 17 - Victims’ Right to Notice of Subpoena of Confidential Information\nThe Proposal:\n\nRule 17 regarding subpoenas should be modified to give victims notice before personal or confidential mformation is\nsubpoenaed and to allow victims to file a motion to quash such a subpoena as follows:\n\n(h)(2) Victim Information. After indictment, no record or document containing personal or confidential information about a\nvictim may be subpoenaed without a finding by the court that the information is relevant to trial and that compliance appears to\nbe reasonable. If the court makes such a finding, notice shall then be given to the victim, through the attorney for the\ngovernment or for the victim, before the subpoena is served. On motion made promptly by the victim, the court may quash or\nmodify the subpoena if compliance would be unreasonable or oppressive.\n\nThe Rationale:\n\nThe existing rules governing subpoenas are flawed because they allow the parties to subpoena personal or confidential\ninformation about a victim from third parties without the victim's knowledge. This issue arose recently in the Utah state\n\n76 Cf. United States v. Wills, 88 F.3d 704, 709-10 (9th Cir. 1996) (allowing delayed disclosure of alibi witness because witness feared for\nsafety and defendant had violent history and allowing ex parte hearing because of need to keep identity of witness from the defendant).\n\n7 18US.CA. 3771(a)(3).\n\n78 See, e.g., United States v. Edwards, 69 F.3d 419, 437 (10th Cir. 1995).\n\n79 18 U.S.C.A. 3771 (a)(3), discussed infra notes 276-308 and accompanying text.\n\nDAVID SCHOEN\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017737",
