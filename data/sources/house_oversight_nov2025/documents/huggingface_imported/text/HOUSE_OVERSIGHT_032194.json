THE SIGNAL fact of the Arab world at the beginning of\nthis year of democratic revolution was that, for the most part, it\nencompassed few of these subtleties and apparent contradictions.\nMiddle Eastern societies had long since moved beyond basic needs of\nfood and security to the point where individual freedom could easily\nbe contemplated.
