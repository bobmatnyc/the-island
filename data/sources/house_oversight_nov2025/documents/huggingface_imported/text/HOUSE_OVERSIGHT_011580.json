  "text": "could see that a similar myopia, or denial, was affecting the armored corps. On\npatrol along the canal, I would sometimes see the hulk of an Israeli tank which\nhad been destroyed by Soviet-made AT-3s. Known as Saggers, they were\nportable, allowing a single soldier to fire wire-guided missiles. Their range was\nnearly a mile-and-a-half, which was more than the main guns on our tanks. Yet\nno one appeared to have addressed the question of what would happen if the\nEgyptians used Saggers on an even greater scale in a future war.\n\nI remained in the Sinai through early 1971, but never led my tank company\non combat operations. By the time we were due for our deployment, the War of\nAttrition was suddenly over. Neither we nor the Egyptians wanted a return to\nfull-scale war. With Washington taking the lead, a cease-fire was agreed. Both\nsides claimed victory. But both were exhausted. Certainly, most Israelis had\nceased to see a compelling reason for the 1,000 days of fighting. We had lost\nabout 900 dead: more than in the Six-Day War.\n\nBut in one respect, the Egyptians won. Under the terms of the truce, their\nanti-aircraft batteries were barred from a roughly 30-mile strip along the canal.\nWithin days of the truce, however, Nasser began moving his SAM batteries\nforward. Before long, there were nearly 100 missile sites in the “prohibited”\nzone, giving the Egyptians control of 20 miles or more of the airspace on our\nside of the canal. Golda was incensed. So was Bar-Lev. But there was no way,\nand no will, to reopen the fighting and force Nasser to move the missiles back.\n\nThe cease-fire took effect at midnight on August 7, 1970. I’ve never had\ntrouble recalling the date, because of a phone call almost exactly 24 hours later.\nIt was from my mother-in-law, to tell me Nava had gone into labor with our first\nchild. Since I was due for deployment on the front line, we had agreed weeks\nearlier that the best thing would be for her to have the baby in Tiberias, so her\nparents could be with her. Now, I got a Jeep and raced north. I reached Tiberias\nthe next morning. I opened the door to the hospital room and saw Nava,\nobviously tired but beaming, cradling our daughter Michal in her arms.\n\nI managed to stay with them for several days before returning to the Sinai.\nWith Nava and Michal soon settled back into our apartment in the north Tel\nAviv neighborhood of Ramat Aviv, I made weekend visits home whenever I\ncould. Still, I saw nowhere near as much of our daughter’s first few months as\nmost fathers. As Nava and I would discover even more jarringly over the next\nfew years, that was an inescapable part of being an army officer.\n\n109\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011580",
