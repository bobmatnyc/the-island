  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nReproductive Freedom Project to advance a broad spectrum of reproductive\nrights.\n\nLitigation continued to be the weapon of choice in this battle.\n\nRoe v. Wade helped secure the Presidency for Ronald Reagan, by giving him a “free” issue. It\nwas free because he — and other “pro-life” Republicans — could strongly oppose all abortion\nwithout alienating moderate Republican women and men who favored a woman’s right to choose\nbut felt secure in the knowledge that the Supreme Court = would continue to protect that right,\nregardless of what Reagan and others said or did. Abortion thus became the most important issue\nfor right-wing religious zealots and a marginal issue for moderate Republicans who favored a\nwoman’s right to choose but who also supported the Republican economic and other programs.\nThis helped to destroy the moderate wing of the Republican Party (the so-called Rockefeller\nRepublicans) and drove former moderates such as the elder George Bush to the right. (He started\nas a pro-choice Republican and ended up as a pro-life Republican whose hands were tied by the\nSupreme Court.)\n\nAt bottom Roe v. Wade and Bush v. Gore represent opposite sides of the same currency of\njudicial activism in areas more appropriately left to the political processes. Courts ought not to\njump into controversies that are political in nature and are capable of being resolved — even if not\nsmoothly or expeditiously — by the popular branches of government. Judges have no special\ncompetence, qualifications or mandate to decide between equally compelling moral claims (as in\nthe abortion controversy) or equally compelling political claims (counting ballots by hand or\nstopping the recount because the standard is ambiguous). Absent clear governing constitutional\nprinciples (which are not present in either case), these are precisely the sorts of issues that should\nbe left to the rough-and-tumble of politics rather than the ipse dixit of five justices.”*\n\nThere are, of course, considerable differences between Roe v. Wade and Bush v. Gore. No matter\nhow critical one may be of Roe, no one can accuse the justices who voted for it of being\npolitically partisan, as were the 5 Republican justices were voted to step the recount and hand the\nelection over the candidate and party for whom they had voted.\n\nThough equality for gays and the right of a woman to choose abortion are the prime wedge issues\nthat today divide the religious right from the rest of the country, there are other issues that also\ndivide the country along religious lines. Some involve religion directly, such as prayer in the\npublic schools, the right of religious groups and persons to be exempted from laws of general\napplication, and religious discrimination—in law or in fact—against atheists, agnostics or\nmembers of unpopular religions or “cults.”\n\nThe difficult question of how to balance freedom of religion with the equally important freedom\nfrom religion—the two sides of the First Amendment coin—is never going to be neatly resolved\nin a pluralistic democracy; it is an ongoing tight rope walk that requires sensitivity from all sides.\nIt also requires a Supreme Court willing to buck popular pressures in this highly sensitive area\nthat the framers of our Constitution deliberately removed from majoritarian politics. Most\n\n4 Whether the same is true of the debate over capital punishment is a more complex issue, because of the\nunfairness and inequality in administering the death penalty.\n\n315\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017402",
