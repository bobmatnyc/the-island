  "text": "/ BARAK / 115\n\nMinister, I felt it was not my place to criticize Olmert publicly when Israeli troops\nwere in action. Two days in, in fact, I told a television interviewer that the\ngovernment had every right to respond and was doing so effectively. Olmert\nphoned to thank me. When he, like Shimon, asked what I thought the government\nshould do next, I was straightforward: “Do your best to bring things to an end as\nsoon as you can.” I said that Halutz and the other generals would be caught up in\nthe operational details, which made his role and that of the cabinet even more\ncritical. “In any operation, you’ll have an idea about what represents a satisfactory\nexit point. But there will be a temptation, when you get close to that point, to take\njust one more step, to keep going until you’re absolutely sure you’ve reached it.”\nResist that temptation, I told him. I said there was a danger that, before they knew\nit, he and the other minister would be in way over their heads.\n\nIn pure military terms, there were just two realistic choices in responding the\nHibzollah attack: a deliberately limited and fairly brief operation, or a full-scale\nwar. We ended up doing neither. The result was an operation that lasted 34 days,\nnearly twice the length of the Yom Kippur War. Our air force flew 12,000\nmissions, more than in 1973 and nearly twice as many as in the 1982 Lebanon\nWar. Hizbollah fired about 4,000 rockets into Israel — from a stockpile we\nestimated to number nearly 20,000 — and not just at the border settlements but as\nfar south as Hadera and Haifa, keeping hundreds of thousands of Israelis under\neffective siege. More than 120 Israeli soldiers and 44 civilians were killed. So were\nhundreds of Hizbollah fighters and, inevitably, many Lebanese civilians as well,\nwith a predictable surge of criticism from much of the outside world. Only\nPresident Bush and Britain’s Tony Blair steadfastly reminded the critics of how the\nwar had actually begun.\n\nThe one putative victory for Israel was the UN cease-fire resolution that Tzipi\nLivni helped to negotiate in August. At least on paper, it contained a commitment\nto a “long-term solution” including the disarmament of Hizbollah and the\n“unconditional release of the abducted Israeli soldiers, which has given rise to the\ncurrent crisis.” But as Israeli newspapers began speaking to the returning soldiers\nand officers, a picture emerged not just of a long and difficult war, but a lack of\nclearly communicated military objectives, and an often-chaotic chain of command,\nwhich ended up costing Israeli lives. Our final advance, alone, shortly before the\ncease-fire, claimed the lives of some 30 soldiers. And for what, many Israelis were\nsoon asking themselves.
