  "text": "Mr. Ambition himself has described uncertainty as an \"emotional amplifier\"... but\nsometimes it amplifies in the wrong direction. After a week or so, I got fed up and cut\nthings off. He asked when we would talk again, and I told him I didn't want to talk for a\nwhile. A few days later, I broke my neck in a bicycle accident.\n\nIt's like a goddamn soap opera, isn't it? Sometimes I can't believe this stuff happens to\nme.\n\nTK OK ok\n\nMr. Ambition showed up in my hospital room while no one else was around. I was no\nlonger afraid that I might die, but I was leaden with morphine, and anxious. I awaited the\nneurosurgeons who would come install a big scary spinal brace, and I felt grateful and\nglad to see Mr. Ambition. I hadn't been certain he would come, although if he'd had such\nan accident, I would have moved Heaven and earth to go see him.\n\n\"I came as soon as our friends told me,\" he said. \"There are so many people who love\nyou.\" He said my name, and spoke softly, and the words bruised my heart.\n\n\"Thank you,\" I said inadequately.\n\n\"I had to skip out on work to get here,\" he said, and sat next to my bed. \"We're in the\nmiddle of important negotiations. A billion-dollar deal.”\n\n\"I'm sorry,” I said. \"Maybe you shouldn't have come.”\n\nHe laughed. \"Don't you think you're worth a billion dollars?”\n\n\"Probably not,\" I said.\n\nHe took my hand. \"Is there anything I can get you?\" he asked.\n\nI wasn't allowed to eat or drink before the surgery. \"Tell me a story,” I requested.\n\nMr. Ambition retold a story from Dostoevsky's The Idiot. It was about a big-hearted man\nwho comes to a small community and befriends an outcast \"fallen woman.” The big-\nhearted man gains high status in the community, but when people find out that he's\nfriends with the marginalized sex worker, they become angry. Despite their\ncondemnation, the man stays steadfastly loyal to his friend, and by seeing the way he\ncares about her, eventually the community accepts her too.\n\nIt was exactly the kind of story I expected to hear from him. I thought of the moment,\nsitting in bed, where he'd said: \"If you're strong enough, you can walk into a trap.\" The\nmoment when I'd realized that I could fall in love with him.\n\nAfter Mr. Ambition finished the story, the doctors arrived with the brace. This\ncontraption involved using power tools to put four screws directly into my skull, which\nstabilize seven pounds of metal. For realz. I was awake while they did it, too. Luckily I\ngot local anesthesia, so the screws didn't hurt while they were going in -- but I heard the\nbone crunching, and I felt the pressure building. Also, my neck hurt a lot. It was\nreasonably horrible.\n\nSome of my friends said later that they arrived at the hospital and tried to get into my\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018629",
