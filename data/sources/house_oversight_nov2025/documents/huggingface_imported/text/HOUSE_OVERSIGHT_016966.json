  "text": "insight. There can be no royal road to becoming Goethe. In scientific atlas after\nscientific atlas, one sees explicit argument that “subjective” factors had to be part of the\nscientific work needed to create, classify, and interpret scientific images.\n\nWhat we see in so many of the algorists’ claims is a tremendous desire to find\nscientific objectivity precisely by abandoning judgment and relying on mechanical\nprocedures—in the name of scientific objectivity. Many American states have legislated\nthe use of sentencing and parole algorithms. Better a machine, it is argued, than the\nvagaries of a judge’s judgment.\n\nSo here is a warning from the sciences. Hands-off algorithmic proceduralism did\nindeed have its heyday in the 19th century, and of course still plays a role in many of the\nmost successful technical and scientific endeavors. But the idea that mechanical\nobjectivity, construed as binding self-restraint, follows a simple, monotonic curve\nincreasing from the bad impressionistic clinician to the good externalized actuary simply\ndoes not answer to the more interesting and nuanced history of the sciences.\n\nThere is a more important lesson from the sciences. Mechanical objectivity is a\nscientific virtue among others, and the hard sciences learned that lesson often. We must\ndo the same in the legal and social scientific domains. What happens, for example, when\nthe secret, proprietary algorithm sends one person to prison for ten years and another for\nfive years, for the same crime? Rebecca Wexler, visiting fellow at the Yale Law School\nInformation Society Project, has explored that question, and the tremendous cost that\ntrade-secret algorithms impose on the possibility of a fair legal defense.*4 Indeed, for a\nvariety of reasons, law enforcement may not want to share the algorithms used to make\nDNA, chemical, or fingerprint identifications, which puts the defense in a much\nweakened position to make its case. In the courtroom, objectivity, trade secrets, and\njudicial transparency may pull in opposite directions. It reminds me of a moment in the\nhistory of physics. Just after World War II, the film giants Kodak and Ilford perfected a\nfilm that could be used to reveal the interactions and decays of elementary particles. The\nphysicists were thrilled, of course—until the film companies told them that the\ncomposition of the film was a trade secret, so the scientists would never gain complete\nconfidence that they understood the processes they were studying. Proving things with\nunopenable black boxes can be a dangerous game for scientists, and doubly so for\ncriminal justice.\n\nOther critics have underscored how perilous it is to rely on an accused (or\nconvicted) person’s address or other variables that can easily become, inside the black\nbox of algorithmic sentencing, a proxy for race. By dint of everyday experience, we have\ngrown used to the fact that airport security is different for children under the age of\ntwelve and adults over the age of seventy-five. What factors do we want the algorists to\nhave in their often hidden procedures? Education? Income? Employment history? What\none has read, watched, visited, or bought? Prior contact with law enforcement? How do\nwe want algorists to weight those factors? Predictive analytics predicated on mechanical\nobjectivity comes at a price. Sometimes it may bea price worth paying; sometimes that\nprice would be devastating for the just society we want to have.\n\nMore generally, as the convergence of algorithms and Big Data governs a greater\nand greater part of our lives, it would be well worth keeping in mind these two lessons\n\n“4 Rebecca Wexler, “Life, Liberty, and Trade Secrets: Intellectual Property in the Criminal Justice System,”\n70 Stanford Law Review, XXX (2018).\n\n163\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016966",
