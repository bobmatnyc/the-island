  "text": "invasion by striking targets in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, North\nKorea presumably plans to defend itself, should war erupt on the\npeninsula, by threatening U.S. regional allies and targets in the United\nStates.\n\nNorth Korea's mission requires small, lightweight warheads, and missiles\nthat work -- and the only way to know that they work is to test them. So\nfar, the weapons have proved unspectacular. The country's first nuclear\ntest, conducted in 2006, was an embarrassment. Pyongyang had told the\nChinese that the device would generate four kilotons of explosive power,\nbut it ended up producing less than one. The second test in 2009 fared\nslightly better, producing between one and eight kilotons, although it is\nnot known what size of a blast the North Koreans had sought. Moreover,\nPyongyang has much more work to do before it can boast weapons that\nwill actually fit on its missiles (which have been, themselves, a series of\nhumiliating failures).\n\nObservers in the West who presume that North Korea's behavior must be\nabout signaling should remember NATO and the United States' own\nexperience during the Cold War. The United States understood then that\nthe ability to conduct nuclear operations was the very foundation of a\ncredible deterrence strategy. Today, a sound strategy for dealing with\nNorth Korea should not ascribe ulterior motives to acts that the United\nStates once considered rational and routine.\n\nThe view that nuclear weapons are merely political instruments -- suitable\nfor sending signals, but not waging wars -- is now so common in\nWashington, London, and Berlin that it is hard to find anyone who\ndisagrees. Yet those comforting assumptions are not shared by leaders\neverywhere. Beyond North Korea, Russia is cutting down its arsenal,\nmodernizing the nuclear forces it plans to keep, and increasing its reliance\non nuclear weapons in national defense strategy. China is slowly\nexpanding its own arsenal, while substantially improving its weapons.\nAnd Iran seems so committed to going nuclear that it has been ready to\nendure crippling sanctions and risk foreign attack.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028669",
