  "text": "There was one plan of the White House Plumbers that never came\nto fruition. It involved the theft of Patricia Ellsberg’ s dental records. This\nwas my own idea—not Haldeman’ s, not Hunt’ s, not Liddy’ s—they\nwere satisfied with obtaining the records of Daniel Ellsberg’ s psychiatrist.\n\nBut | remembered that the first time Alger Hiss confronted\nWhittaker Chambers, he requested to see his teeth. Hiss explained to me\nthat he suspected Chambers might be someone he had known years\nbefore, and he wanted to see his teeth to make sure.\n\nWell, that recollection inspired me. We were able to obtain the\ndental records of Ellsberg’ s wife, all right, but did not have the\nOpportunity to use them in helping to prove that she was guilty of\nespionage. | could not imagine exactly how we were going to achieve this\nbut | did know that, whatever, it would be accepted by the public simply\nbecause the charge itself was so “off the wall.”\n\nHow odd that Whittaker Chambers, the dignified translator of\nBambi, had been asked to publicly show his teeth as if he were some kind\n\nof stud at a horse show. | have never been able to forget that moment.\n\nzk k *\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015128",
