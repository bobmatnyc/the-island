EPS estimate. The 22x\nmultiple is towards the upper end of Priceline’s historical multiple range of 13-23x and\nrepresents a PEG of 1.4x. We think a 22x forward P/E multiple is appropriate given mid-\nteens EPS growth, strong booking trends, Priceline's leadership position in the global\nonline travel sector, track record of EPS upside, and increased access to the China via\nthe Ctrip investment.\n\nBankof America 2 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 33\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014919",
