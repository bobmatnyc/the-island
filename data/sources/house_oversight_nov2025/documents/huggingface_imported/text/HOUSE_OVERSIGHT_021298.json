The\ncondition has variously been termed\ntakotsubo cardiomyopathy, left-\nventricular apical ballooning,\nmyocardial stunning, stress\ncardiomyopathy, or in the more\nvernacular parlance of the New York\nTimes, broken heart syndrome\n(prompted by a medical review that was\npublished just before Valentine’s Day).\nIn general accord with the speculation of\nCannon, broken heart syndrome appears\nto be triggered by an exaggerated\nautonomic nervous system response,\ncharacterized by sympathetic activation\nand high levels of the stress hormone\nepinephrine (adrenalin) (3). It is\nimportant to note in these cases that\npsychological states, as mild as they may\nbe, are able to induce a clear and\ndemonstrable organ pathology.\n\nPhysiological abnormalities or\ndysfunctions underlie medical\nconditions, and indeed, constitute the\ndefining features of disease states. An\nimportant question, however, is how\nthose dysfunctions come to be. There are\nmany ways in which disease develops —\ntraumatic injuries, biotic infections,\ndegenerative conditions — and the list\ngoes on. The fields of psychophysiology,\npsychosomatic or behavioral medicine,\nand health psychology are particularly\nconcerned with how psychological and\nbehavioral factors impact physiological\nsystems and thus health. Of particular\ninterest are those psychological\ndimensions that uniquely impact\n\nphysiology.\nAn example comes from the\n\nstudy of Herpes Simplex viral infections.\nHerpes Simplex viruses are responsible\n\nPage |52\n\nfor cold sores (HSV type I) and genital\nherpes (HSV type IT). Once contracted,\nherpes virus infections generally remain\nfor life, although they are characterized\nby periodic eruptions and remissions.\nDuring the latter, the immune system\neffectively dampens viral activity and\nthe virus retreat to a more or less\ndormant state. Although multiple factors\nlikely contribute to the reactivation of\nHSV, one trigger appears to be stress—\nthe defacing cold sore that erupts, for\nexample, just before the prom or an\nimportant date. Ohio State researchers\nsought an animal model of this\nreactivation, so the underlying links and\nmediators could be studied. Try as they\nmight, however, the research group was\nunable to reactivate HSV infections in\nmice with standard laboratory stressors,\nsuch as restraint-stress or shock. In a\ncollaborative effort, we pointed out that\nthe stressors that lead to HSV\nreactivation in humans were often of a\nsocial nature. Indeed, for both humans\nand mice, social relations are central to\nhappiness, adaptation and even survival.\nIn light of this, a social stressor was\nintroduced into the project (changing the\nhousing groupings and thus disrupting\nestablished social relations). The social\nstress, but again not physical stressors,\nresulted in significant HSV reactivation\n(4). Psychological factors, and in this\ncase a specific social psychological\nvariable, uniquely impacted an important\naspect of viral immunity. This early\nfinding led to a series of studies that\nhave elucidated physiological pathways\nthat mediate the relationship between\nsocial stress, immune function and HSV\nreactivation. But, what is it that makes\nsocial stress unique and distinct from\nphysical stressors?\n\nWe have identified a probable\ngeneral contributor to the differences\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021298",
