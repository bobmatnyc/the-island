  "text": "Medicaid: While We Focus on Federal Government Dynamics, It’s Notable\n\nthat State Government Medicaid Funding Also Faces Significant Challenges\n\ne Medicaid = Major and Growing Expense Line Item for State Governments\n\n- Medicaid funding responsibility is shared between federal & state governments. States with higher\nper-capita income (like New York) pay ~50% of total Medicaid cost while states with lower per-capita\nincome (like Mississippi) pay ~22%.\n\n- Onaverage, Medicaid accounted for 21% of total state spending in F2009 (ranging from Missouri at\n35% to Alaska at 8%). Enrollment growth has been accelerating, in part, owing to more people losing\n\nemployer-sponsored health insurance in the recession, and thus overall Medicaid costs jumped ~11%\nY/Y from October, 2009 to June, 2010.\n\n- State governments (which unlike the federal government must balance their annual budgets) cannot\npay for such elevated levels of Medicaid and maintain normal spending levels for other services (like\neducation and public safety).\n\ne Enter the Federal Government\n\n- ARRA (2009 economic stimulus) provided ~$100 billion in support for the states to pay for elevated\nlevels of Medicaid costs and to avoid large budget cuts in education and public safety. This went a\nlong way toward holding down the states’ contribution, but it is a one-time unsustainable fix.\n\ne Federal Support May Be Expiring by June, 2011\n\n- Ifno action is taken, the Medicaid-related cost burden on the states will rise dramatically in coming\nyears. As aresult, many states are on the verge of implementing Medicaid cost containment plans\nthat include cuts in doctor payments, benefit limitations, higher patient co-payments, etc. Moreover,\nmany states are fearful that the recently enacted healthcare reform will lead to additional Medicaid-\nrelated costs when it goes into full effect in 2014.\n\nKP Data Source: National Conference of State Legislatures, “State Budget Update: July 2009.”\n(@)E) www.kpcb.com USA Inc. | Income Statement Drilldown 99\n\nRising Debt Periodic Large\n, Level & Interest One-Time\nSpend\npend Payments Charges\n\nEntitlement\n\nNote: *denotes F2010 net income / net loss of respective programs, data per White House OMB. 1) Medicare and Social Security net loss\nexcludes Trust Fund interest income. 2) TARP net loss includes proceeds from sale of warrants.
