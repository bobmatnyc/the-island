Privileged though I felt as Prime Minister to be able to pursue what I\nfelt deeply were Israel’s national interests, the trappings of office were not that\nimportant to me. I’d gone into politics to do things, not for the photo opportunities.\nI did still believe it was important to see the final diplomatic push by Clinton\nthrough to its end. But I knew an early election for Prime Minister wouldn’t\nhappen overnight. It would involve a couple of months’ preparation.\n\nWhen I called a news conference on December 9, the media, and the country,\nassumed that it was about the Palestinian violence and the ups and downs of the\nClinton initiative, and I did talk about both. But at the end, I said: “There are those\nwho doubt the mandate I recetved from the citizens of Israel. I have decided to\nseek a new mandate — to lead the state of Israel on the road to peace, security and a\nproper civic and social agenda.” I said I would go see the Israeli President the\nfollowing morning. “I will formally resign, and run for a special election, at the\nhead of the Labor Party, for the Prime Ministership of Israel.”\n\nThe election was set for February 2001. The last act in President Clinton’s\nattempt at a breakthrough actually came after the American election, and just a\nmonth before George W. Bush would succeed him. Since, in practical terms, any\nfinal agreement would almost certainly come under President Bush, Clinton’s final\nnegotiating paper was framed as a set of paramaters which, if agreed to by both\nsides, were intended to set the stage for a final deal. On December 23, Clinton\npresented the draft to both sides’ representatives at the White House. I wasn’t\nthere. But the accounts I got from Shlomo, Gili and Dennis Ross afterwards made\nme feel as if I was. The president said he would read through the document and\nthen leave the Israeli and Palestinian teams with Dennis to make sure they’d\nrecorded each detail. He said this was no longer the starting point for further\nargument on the basic shape of a peace deal. This was his considered judgement of\n\n386\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028234",
