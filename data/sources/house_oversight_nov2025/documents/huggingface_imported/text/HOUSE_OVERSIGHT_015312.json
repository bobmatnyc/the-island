  "text": "But if Harry had been named after his other grandfather, there\nwouldn’ t have been a Peter, Paul and Harry. Each of us prepared to\nperform in our own particular way. Peter stared at himself in the mirror\nand made strange sounds to exercise his vocal cords. Harry sat in a\nseparate room where his makeup woman, who had flown in from lowa,\ntransformed him into Derek Smalls from the mockumentary Sp/na/ Tap.\nAnd | was off hiding behind some boxes, toking away on a joint of the\nmarijuana that served as my creative fuel. Scott was sure that | performed\nbetter when | wasn’ t high, and he was under the impression | was\nstraight when he told me one night, “That was the best show you’ ve\never done.” | confessed that | had smoked a giant doobie before | went\nonstage.
