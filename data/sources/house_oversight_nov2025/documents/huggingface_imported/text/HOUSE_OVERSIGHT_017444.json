There were not always\nunderstood by those who disagreed with where my principles sometimes took me and who\nthey led me to represent. That is why I have made it a policy to correct the record. I\nadmit that I have always tried to get the last word. Hence this posthumous letter to the\neditor which I promise is my last word.\n\nAlan Dershowitz\nFrom I don’t know where\n\nI hope this posthumous letter to the editor isn’t published for a while, but I suspect it will be\nrelevant whenever my obituary appears. That’s ok—as long as I get the last word!\n\n357\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017444",
