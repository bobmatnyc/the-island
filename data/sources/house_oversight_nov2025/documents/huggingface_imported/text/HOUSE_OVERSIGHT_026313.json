  "text": "papers from a woman (who later dropped her lawsuit) that Donald Trump and Epstein had\nraped her when she was 13, Bannon said in response to Ivanka, “What about the allegations\nabout her dad and that 13-year-old?”\n\nEpstein has previously used his millions to cultivate the world’s most powerful — but has\n\nmostly given money to Democrats.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2003, Bill Clinton flew on Epstein’s private plane, dubbed “The Lolita Express,”\n\n26 times. Epstein is close to Prince Andrew and was aregular at Trump’s Mar-a-Lago.\n\nTrump told New York magazine of Epstein in 2002, “Terrific guy. He’s a lot of fun to be with.\nIt is even said that he likes beautiful women as much as I do, and many of them are on the\n\nyounger side.”\n\nEpstein, 65, pleaded guilty in 2008 to soliciting prostitution from a teen and served 13 months\n\nin jail.\n\nLast year, he reportedly paid millions to settle three lawsuits filed against him by teens.\nBannon’s rep didn’t comment. A lawyer for Epstein said, “Let me ask him,” but didn’t respond\n\nby deadline.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026313",
