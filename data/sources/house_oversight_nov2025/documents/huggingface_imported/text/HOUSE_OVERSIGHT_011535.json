  "text": "Chapter Four\n\nAt first, it was only “approval in principle”. It’s impossible to overstate the\ntrepidation with which Israel’s military brass, and Ben-Gurion himself,\napproached the decision finally to send Sayeret Matkal into action. It was not\njust the fact that we were a unit uttterly untested in the field. The stakes in the\nmission we were contemplating were enormous. For the first time since Uri\nIlan’s deseperate act of suicide in a Damascus jail cell, Israeli soldiers would be\ncrossing into Arab territory on an intelligence mission. Amid continuing\ntensions with the increasingly militant rulers of Egypt and Syria, there seemed\nlittle doubt that at some stage we would again have to fight to defend our\nsecurity, perhaps even our existence as a state. The Rotem debacle had\nhighlighted the danger of a surprise attack, potentially leaving us in a scramble\nto call up reserve units as Syrian or Egyptian tanks advanced on our borders.\nBut the memory of Uri Ilan remained a haunting reminder of the risks of failure.\n\nMy role, again, came down partly to accident. The man initially chosen to\nlead the operation was someone I’d liked from my first days in the sayeret.\nYa’akov Tal, known as Tubul, was a year older than me. He came from Tiberias\nin the north of Israel. As a teenager, he’d worked for extra pocket money\nalongside shepherds in the hills above the Sea of Galilee, picking up a near-\nfluent command of Arabic. He was self-confident without a trace of arrogance,\nwith a natural talent for connecting with his soldiers. In my case, there was a\nfurther bond: a shared fascination with math and sciences.\n\nBut Tubul had applied to the leading technology institute in Israel, the\nTechnion near Haifa. As he began training his four-man team to cross onto\nSyria’s Golan Heights, he received word that he’d been accepted. The academic\nyear wouldn’t begin until September, and it had been assumed at first that the\noperation would happen before then. But even though Meir Amit was pressing\nthe rest of the military brass for a final go-ahead, it still hadn’t arrived by early\nAugust. Avraham decided he needed a fall-back plan. He called Tubul and me\ninto his office. He said he wanted me to join the team’s training as Tubul’s\ndeputy, and to be ready to step in as commander if that proved necessary. When\nwe next heard from Amit, a week later, it became clear the mission would not\nhappen in time for Tubul to lead it.\n\nWe would be setting out from the northeast corner of Israel, a patch of\nparkland near a kibbutz called Dan, only a mile or so from where Uri Ilan’s\ngroup had begun its mission. This time, however, the target was more\n\n64\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011535",
