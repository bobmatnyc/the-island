Uncertainty around the timing of this revenue\nramp reflects a lack of clarity on how quickly retailers, in particular mass market\nretailers, will begin to stock the products following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill.\n\nFigure 28 We Estimate CBD Nutraceuticals Can Generate ~$2.4 BN in Sales Going Forward\n\n$3,000 U.S. CBD Nutraceutical Sales (S$ in mm)\n\n62.500 $2,400\n\n$2,000\n$1,500\n\n$1,000\n\n$500\n\nSO\n\n2018 I 2019E 2020E\n\nSource: Cowen and Company\n\nOur $2.4 bn estimate is benchmarked against the herbal supplement market in the U.S.\nAccording to the American Botanical Council, herbal supplement retail sales were $6.4\nbn in 2014, posting the 11 year of consecutive growth. Between 2004-2014, the\nherbal supplement category grew its revenues at a ~4.2% CAGR. Extrapolating that\ngrowth out to 2019 would imply a total herbal supplement market of ~$8 bn over the\nnext two years. Our $2.4 bn estimate for the CBD market would imply almost a 30%\nshare of this market by 2020. The importance of retail adoption is reflected in the\ncategory makeup of the herbal supplement market, where we can see that over 17% of\nsales come from mass market retailers.\n\nFigure 29 Mass Market Makes Up ~17% of Herb Retail Sales Figure 30 Herb Retail Sales To Exceed ~$8 BN Assuming 4.2% CAGR\nU.S Herb Retail Sales by Channel (2014) U.S. Herb Retail Sales (All Channels, $ in mm) gazes\nMass $8,500 $7,894, /\nMarket $8,000\n17% $7,500 /\n$7,000\n$6,500 $6,441\n$6,000\nDirect Sales $5,500\n49%\n$5,000\n$4,500\nNatural & J $4,000\nHealth Seas s ese ssagnunyags a6\n[a SS a a od N\nFoods NNUNANNNNNNNN NNN eo\n34%\nSource: American Botanical Council and Cowen and Company Source: American Botanical Council and Cowen and Company\n28 COWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024844",
