Sea access\nmust remain blocked to prevent weapons smuggling.\n\nThe Israeli position defies a brutal truth: last year’s flotilla made a big\ndifference for the people of Gaza — at a terrible cost in lives — by\nrefocusing international attention on their plight and forcing a change\nin Israeli policy. Today, twice as many goods enter from Israel as\nbefore. Nonetheless, Gaza remains a deeply sad and deprived place.\n“The focus on humanitarian aid by both flotilla organizers and the\nIsraeli government is infuriating and misleading,” Gisha, an Israeli\nhuman rights group focused on Gaza, said in a statement. “There is\nno shortage of food in Gaza, but economic recovery is blocked by\nsweeping restrictions.”\n\nThe Exodus analogy supports a certain political and public relations\nstrategy. In July 1947, when Britain ruled Palestine and the number\nof Jews allowed in was severely limited, the ship, with 4,500 Jewish\nrefugees from Europe, tried to get through. British forces boarded it,\nkilled three people, wounded dozens and essentially destroyed the\nship as it listed in Haifa harbor.\n\nThe British ultimately sent the passengers to Hamburg. The sight of\nthousands of Jewish refugees shipped to Germany soon after the\nHolocaust sparked international outrage and sympathy for the Zionist\ncause, a key goal of the trip. “The Exodus showed that if the British\nare callous enough to send Jews back to Germany, the only ones who\nshould be in charge of the fate of the Jews are the Jews themselves,”\nobserved M. M. Silver, an Israeli historian and the author of “Our\nExodus.” “Palestinian forces are trying to make the same point\nthrough the flotilla, that Israel has no right to control the fate of\nPalestinians.”\n\nSeveral months after the Exodus, the United Nations General\nAssembly voted for the establishment of two states in Palestine,\nJewish and Arab, the key diplomatic moment in Israel’s history.
