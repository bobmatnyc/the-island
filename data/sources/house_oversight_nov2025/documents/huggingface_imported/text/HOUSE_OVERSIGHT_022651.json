The leader\nof the administration before his, yes that guy, was also linked to a pedophile prostitution ring uncovered in the\nFranklin pedophile investigation. Research it; and also the name Johnny Gosh. It’s a fascinating true story.\n\n79.\nmsueh\n\nMarch 30, 2014 at 3:34 pm — Log in to Reply\n\nWhen are both of them going to end up on their list of “disappearances”?\n\nSS ee\n\n80.\n\nDoug\nMarch 31, 2014 at 6:45 am — Log in to Reply\n\nThe clintons are just evil vial people and I am not surprised about this at all. Also there was a comment asking\nabout the ages of those girls involved? “Clinton was friends with an unnamed woman who “kept images of\nnaked underage children on her computer, helped to recruit underage children for Epstein... and photographed\nunderage females in sexually explicit poses.”\n\nRead more at http://www.westernjournalism.com/clinton-snared-pedophile-ring/#PkFfIXxkTOIMkgS1.99\n\nPretty much covers that they were in fact underage children. Makes me sick to my stomach and would love to\nsee “old icky billy” get his just reward but doubt it as the article also states, “because of friends in High Places”.\n\nSSS a Se wee\n\n81.\nJan\n\nMarch 31, 2014 at 8:11 am — Log in to Reply\n\nThis hasn’t surfaced because it’s a bunch of B.S.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022651",
