  "text": "you would be told, 'This is a hand, you have a body,' and then you would have an\ninterpretation of that experience, which you would call a thought. And then you would also\nbe told, 'This is your body. You have a mind. You’re Indian. And you come from a Hindu\nfamily.’ All social constructs. Fundamental reality is sensory perception, which is an\nactivation of consciousness, and its interpretation is thought. The rest is a story. Mind, body,\nand even universe is a story.\" Well, that was pretty mind-boggling for a young person at\nthe age of 35. I’d already trained now, here. Slowly, that lead to how one construct leads to\nanother construct. Okay, so this is an iPhone. It’s matter. Well I have now reified sensory\nexperience in consciousness, an activity of consciousness 1n consciousness, with a construct,\niPhone. Then I reify it further, made of matter. And now this is very convenient. I can study\nit. It?s made of molecules, made of atoms. So one construct leads to another construct,\nparticles. Then you get ultimately to possibility waves and then you’re stuck again.\n\nOkay [laughter], but along the chain, one construct built to another construct to another\nconstruct to another construct. Very useful. New York City is a construct. Latitude is a\nconstruct. Longitude is a construct. Time is it construct. Money is a construct. Wall Street is\na construct. Religion is a construct. God is a construct. Universe is a construct, which you\ncall a model, Okay. So, this led me to consciousness, exploring consciousness. Where now,\nyou have—you know I just came from this conference, on the science of consciousness,\nwhere you have physicalists, you have dualists, you have panpsychists, you have idealists,\nand they’re all arguing about the constructs.\n\nSo the physicalists are now in a difficult position, because they’re trying to explain\nconsciousness with the construct of physicality, and you can’t. Because physicality itself is a\nconstruct. Then you have the idealists going back to Plato who are saying it’s all mental. But\neven mental ideas are constructs. Then you have the dualists, Descartes, the two are\nseparate, mind and body. But then how do you explain their interaction? It violates simple\nlaws like thermodynamics. If mind is separate and body is separate, how do I lift my arm? I\nstart with a thought so I do this. How do I speak, how do I walk, how do I do anything? So,\ndualism doesn’t make me happy. Idealism doesn’t make me happy. Physicalism, I don’t\nknow what matter is anymore.\n\nI interviewed the Nobel laureate Wilczek, physicist from MIT. So I said, \"What is\n\nmatter?\" \"It’s particles.\" I said, \"What are particles, subatomic particles?\" He says, \"They are\nlittle things.\" I said, \"But then everybody says that’s a wave potential, that’s in Hilbert space.\nWhat is that? Where is Hilbert space?\" He says, \"It’s mathematical.\" \"What is it?\" \"It’s\ninfinitely dimensional or zero dimensional.\" \"Where is it?\" The usual answer is \"Shut up and\ncalculate,\" right? So I realized that the entire new paradigm of multiverse, superstrings,\neternal inflation, whatever, is all in mathematical imagination. Hilbert space is in\nmathematical imagination, the wave potential is in mathematical imagination. I said to\nWilczek, \"What is matter?\" And he said, \"We’re still trying to figure that out.\" [Laughter.] I\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029514",
