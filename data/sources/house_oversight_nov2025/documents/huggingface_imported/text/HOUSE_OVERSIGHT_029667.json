  "text": "might astound themselves. Because, in the end, everyone in political life gets carried out\n- the only relevant question is whether the pallbearers will be crying.\"\n\nFor Keating, the 20th-century leader exerting most influence on the coming century is\nChina's Deng Xiaoping.\n\n\"If you look at the other figures of the century, Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin and Mao, none\nwill leave the legacy in terms of the 21st century that Deng leaves,\" he says. \"He walked\n\naway from the ideology of the Communist Party just as effectively as Mikhail Gorbachev\n\nwalked away from the essence of the Soviet Union.\"\n\nBy 2050 Keating sees a world order with nations in terms of gross domestic product in\nthis hierarchy: (1) China, (2) US, (3) India, (4) Japan, (5) Brazil, (6) Russia, (7) Britain, (8)\nGermany, (9) France and (10) Italy.\n\nThe key, however, is that Japan lags a distant fourth behind the top three.\n\nOn America, Keating is dismayed by the pivotal change in its outlook after the end of the\nCold War. \"When the Berlin Wall came down the Americans cried victory and walked off\nthe field,\" he says.\n\n\"Yet the end of the Cold War offered the chance for America to develop a new world\norder. It didn't know what to do with its victory. This at the moment the US should have\nbegun exploiting the opportunity of establishing a new world order to embrace open\nregionalism and the inclusion of great states like China, India and the then loitering\nRussia.\n\n\"Well, frankly, the US didn't have the wisdom. It just wanted to celebrate its peace\ndividend. The two Clinton terms and the two George W. Bush terms, that's four\npresidential terms, have cost US mightily.\"\n\nFor Keating, the malaise in US politics is the problem. He says: \"The most compelling\nthing I've seen in years is that in the great burst of American productivity between 1990\nand 2008, of that massive increment to national income, none of it went to wages. By\ncontrast, in Australia real wages over the same period had risen by 30 per cent.\" Keating\nsees this \"as the breakdown of America's national compact\", the shattering of its\nprosperity deal. He says American conservatives abandoned the middle ground\nrepresented by Republican presidents such as Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon and\nBush Sr and became radicals. The derailment, he argues, began under Ronald Reagan\nand reached its zenith under George W. Bush.\n\nWith the goodwill gone the US \"is not able to produce a medium-term credible fiscal\ntrajectory or get agreement on rebuilding its infrastructure\". This paralysis “is significant\nnot just for the US but for the world.\"\n\nKeating links the collapse of this \"prosperity compact\" to the financial crisis. Too many\nAmericans were unable to sustain themselves from wages and salaries.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029667",
