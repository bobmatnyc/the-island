  "text": "Knowledge-Based Education vs. Process-Based Education 87\n\ndecisions are made through argumentation and force of reason—not\nby knowing the right answer. People who know a lot are generally\nquite smart. I could do well at Jeopardy as could most professors, I\nwould think. But we are not successful intellectuals because we know a\nlot of facts. We know a lot of facts because we are successful intellectu-\nals. People have got this backwards.\n\nConsider athletes. A great baseball player and a great basketball\nplayer, it can be assumed, also will be very good at lifting weights. But\nthey did not become good at lifting weights and then become great\nathletes. It was the other way around. They had a natural talent for\nhitting a ball or shooting baskets and then they had to get stronger in\norder to compete with others who had the same talents. The talent is\nthe reason—not the weightlifting. Michael Jordan, a really great ath-\nlete, couldn’t become a successful baseball player because he couldn’t\nhit a curve ball. That talent had nothing to do with the athletic abil-\nity that made him a great basketball player. Hitting a curve ball is a\ndifferent kind of talent. His weightlifting ability was the same either\nway. I know a lot of facts and I am talented at designing educational\nsoftware. The facts I know do not help with the talent. But the more\neducational software I design in different domains of knowledge, the\nmore facts I pick up.\n\nWhen we look at people who are knowledgeable and confuse that\nwith people who can think well, we totally miss the point about edu-\ncation. Education ought not be focused on imparting facts any more\nthan athletic training ought to be focused on weightlifting. You learn\nto hit a ball by hitting one and you learn to think clearly by thinking.\nFocusing on the 12 cognitive processes I have outlined, rather than\nfocusing on fact acquisition, helps one learn to think.\n\nTESTING TEACHES THAT SOME SUBJECTS ARE MORE\nIMPORTANT THAN OTHERS\n\nThe tests are small in number. If there were thousands to choose from,\nthen perhaps people could get tested in fiber optics instead of history.\nBut the system has determined which subjects are the most impor-\ntant. The system made that determination in 1892. Some things have\nchanged in the world since then. There are a few new subjects—psy-\nchology, computers, medicine, business, and law, for example.
