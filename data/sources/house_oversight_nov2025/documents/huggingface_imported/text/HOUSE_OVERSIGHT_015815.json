It turns\nout that the mitochondria which powers our bodies emit photons of UV\nlight as a waste product of their metabolism. The speculation is tubulin\nharvests this waste energy.\n\nBefore we argue for this mechanism any further we still need to\nestablish that a non-computational mechanism is needed to allow human\nthought. In the next chapters, we will look at the nature of knowledge\nand, in particular, mathematical creativity and the Wiles Paradox.\n\nMicrotubule\n\nTubulin\n\nQuantum Coupling of Tubulin in Microtubule\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015815",
