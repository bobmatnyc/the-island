So what happens then with this transcript is, there is\n\nan attempt at a deposition of Ms. Hall in Miami, this summer,\n\nand Ms. Hall comes in and she sits down, and she doesn't want\n\nto answer any questions about anything, and she says, I don't\nremember anything about any of this. Her lawyer says, she\n\ndoesn't remember anything about any of this and she spent the\n\nlast ten years forgetting about all of this and she's not going\n\nto remember anything about this. Mr. Edwards then puts the\n\ntranscript in front of her and she doesn't look at it. She\n\ndoesn't even look at the transcript. She doesn't turn the\n\npage. She doesn't read any of it. There's a question asked at\n\nsome point later: Isn't it true that everything you said in\n\nthe police department was true? And then shortly after that,\n\nthe deposition ends. And they're trying to say that that is a\nsufficient factual basis and an evidentiary basis for the\nadmission of this transcript, which is, you know, unsponsored\nhearsay.\n\nThere's a similar problem with this recording because\n\nMs. Hall never listened to the recording, never authenticated\n\nthe recording. And so there's no evidence whatsoever that it's\n\nMs. Hall's statement or that it was subject to any\n\ncross-examination.\n\nSo to try to get around all of these evidentiary\n\nproblems, now what's being advanced by the plaintiffs is, well,\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011415",
