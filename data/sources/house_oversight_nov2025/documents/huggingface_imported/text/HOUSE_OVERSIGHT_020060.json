  "text": "“So we're going to do it,” insisted Bannon, with joie de guerre and manic energy, “the\nway they did it. Separate war room, separate lawyers, separate spokespeople. It’s keeping\nthat fight over there so we can wage this other fight over here. Everybody gets this. Well,\nmaybe not Trump so much. Not clear. Maybe a little. Not what he imagined.”\n\nBannon, in great excitement, and Priebus, grateful for an excuse to leave the\npresident’s side, rushed back to the West Wing to begin to cordon it off.\n\nIt did not escape Priebus’s notice that Bannon had in mind to create a rear guard of\ndefenders—David Bossie, Corey Lewandowski, and Jason Miller, all of whom would be\noutside spokespeople—that would largely be loyal to him. Most of all, it did not escape\nPriebus that Bannon was asking the president to play a role entirely out of character: the\ncool, steady, long-suffering chief executive.\n\nAnd it certainly didn’t help that they were unable to hire a law firm with a top-notch\nwhite-collar government practice. By the time Bannon and Priebus were back in\nWashington, three blue-chip firms had said no. All of them were afraid they would face a\nrebellion among the younger staff if they represented Trump, afraid Trump would publicly\nhumiliate them if the going got tough, and afraid Trump would stiff them for the bill.\n\nIn the end, nine top firms turned them down.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020060",
