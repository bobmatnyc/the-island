  "text": "183\n\nSnowden’s trip to Hong Kong in May 2013 made the Chinese intelligence service, willy-nilly,\na potential player in game. Hong Kong is a part of China, even if independently administrated,\nand, as such, China has full responsibility for its national security and foreign affairs. This mandate\nincludes monitoring foreign intelligence operatives. The Chinese intelligence service accordingly\nruns much of the local intelligence apparatus in Hong Kong. For this purpose, it maintains its\nlargest intelligence base outside of mainland China in Hong Kong. Its officers are stationed\nofficially in the Prince of Wales skyscraper in central Hong Kong and unofficially maintain\ninformers in Hong Kong’s police, governing authority, airport administration and at other levers\nof power in Hong Kong. It checks the computerized visitors entering Hong Kong, and has the\ncapability to ferret names that match those in the immense date base its global cyber espionage\nhas amassed. When it detects the entry of any person of possible intelligence interest, it has the\nopportunity of using its sophisticated array of cyber tools to remotely steal data from those\nindividuals. Such remote surveillance was so effective in 2013 that the US State Department had\ninstructed all its personnel in Hong Kong to avoid using their Iphones, Androids, Blackberries and\nsmart phones when travelling to Hong Kong or China. Instead, it has supplied them with\nspecially-altered phones that disable location tracking and have a remotely-activated switch to\ncompletely cut off power to it circuitry. No one in the intelligence community doubts the\nprudence of taking such precautions in the realm of China.\n\nOnce Hong Kong had served as a window into China for Western intelligence, but in the first\ndecade of the 21* century, the Chinese intelligence service had achieved such a pervasive presence\nin Hong Kong, and such ubiquitous electronic coverage of diplomats and other foreigners even\nsuspected of involvement in foreign intelligence work, that the CIA and British intelligence found\nit almost as difficult to operate in Hong Kong as in mainland China. The CIA as well as the DIA\nkept a few officers there, but, as a former CIA station chief told me in September 2013, that for\nthe purposes of intelligence operations, the CIA “regards Hong Kong as hostile territory.”\n\nSnowden apparently knew the limits of CIA operations in Hong Kong. It indeed provided him\nwith an envelope of protection. He told Greenwald, as will be recalled, that he was counting on\nthe Chinese presence in Hong Kong to deter the CIA from intruding on their meetings.\n\nSnowden also must have realized that he was entering the Chinese sphere of influence when he\nflew to Hong Kong in May 2013. Yet, he took with him level 3 NSA secrets which he could\nassume would be of great interest to China. In fact, he advertised this fact in his interview with\nthe South China Post, a newspaper controlled in 2013 by mainland China. Whatever he may\nhave assumed about the inability of the CIA to stop him in Hong Kong, he had no reason to\nassume that Chinese intelligence service would relegate itself to purely passive role, especially\nwhen secret NSA’s documents were in a hotel room in Hong Kong. Snowden may have\nesteemed himself to be an independent actor playing Prometheus on a global stage provided by\nYouTube, but the Chinese may have viewed him as nothing more as another pawn in the Game of\nNations.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020335",
