The Brain\n\nPenrose-Hameroff Conjecture — Brains are quantum-gravity\ncomputers using tubulin as the mediator.\n\n. Knowledge\n\nInformation Continuum Hypothesist — Information is finite,\nbut understanding and knowledge are different in nature.\nInfinite Monkeys Hypothesis — The paradox that says monkeys\ncould type Hamlet given enough time and paper.\n\nCat Experimentt — Finding my house cat can use our computer,\nand may be more creative than monkeys!\n\n.
