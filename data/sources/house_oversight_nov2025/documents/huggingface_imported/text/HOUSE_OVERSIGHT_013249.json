  "text": "Glossary of Specialized Terms 333\n\nHebbian Links: Links recording information about the associative relationship (co-\noccurrence) between Atoms. These include symmetric and asymmetric HebbianLinks.\nHeterarchical Network: A network of linked elements in which the semantic relationships\nassociated with the links are generally symmetrical (e.g. they may be similarity links, or\nsymmetrical associative links). This is one important sort of subnetwork of an intelligent\nsystem; see Dual Network.\n\nHierarchical Network: A network of linked elements in which the semantic relationships\nassociated with the links are generally asymmetrical, and the parent nodes of a node have\na more general scope and some measure of control over their children (though there may be\nimportant feedback dynamics too). This is one important sort of subnetwork of an intelligent\nsystem; see Dual Network.\n\nHigher-Order Inference (HOI): PLN inference involving variables or higher-order func-\ntions. In contrast to First-Order Inference (FOI).\n\nHillclimbing: A general term for greedy, local optimization techniques, including some\nrelatively sophisticated ones that involve *mildly nonlocal” jumps.\n\nHuman-Level Intelligence: General intelligence that’s ’as smart as’ human general in-\ntelligence, even if in some respects quite unlike human intelligence. An informal concept,\nwhich generally doesn’t come up much in CogPrime work, but is used frequently by some\nother AI theorists.\n\nHuman-Like Intelligence: General intelligence with properties and capabilities broadly\nresembling those of humans, but not necessarily precisely imitating human beings.\nHypergraph: A conventional hypergraph is a collection of nodes and links, where each\nlink may span any number of nodes. OpenCog makes use of generalized hypergraphs (the\nAtomspace is one of these).\n\ne Imitation Learning: Learning via copying what some other agent is observed to do.\n\ne Implication: Often refers to an ImplicationLink between two PredicateNodes, indicating\n\nan (extensional, intensional or mixed) logical implication.\n\nImplicit Knowledge Representation: Representation of knowledge via having easily\nhumanly identifiable pieces of knowledge correspond to the pattern of organization and/or\ndynamics of elements, rather than via having individual elements correspond to easily hu-\nmanly identifiable pieces of knowledge.\n\nImportance: A generic term for the Attention Values associated with Atoms. Most com-\nmonly these are STI (short term importance) and LTI (long term importance) values. Other\nimportance values corresponding to various different time scales are also possible. In general\nan importance value reflects an estimate of the likelihood an Atom will be useful to the\nsystem over some particular future time-horizon. STI is generally relevant to processor time\nallocation, whereas LTT is generally relevant to memory allocation.\n\nImportance Decay: The process of Atom importance values (e.g. STI and LTT) decreasing\nover time, if the Atoms are not utilized. Importance decay rates may in general be context-\ndependent.\n\nImportance Spreading: A synonym for Importance Updating, intended to highlight the\nsimilarity with “activation spreading” in neural and semantic networks.\n\nImportance Updating: The CIM-Dynamic that periodically (frequently) updates the STI\nand LTI values of Atoms based on their recent activity and their relationships.\nImprecise Truth Value: Peter Walley’s imprecise truth values are intervals [L,U], inter-\npreted as lower and upper bounds of the means of probability distributions in an envelope\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013249",
