This explanation requires simply that we rec-\nognize revolutions as a coordination problem (as argued in Morris & Shin, 2002;\nChwe, 2013), where each revolutionary chooses whether to revolt, and each is better\noff revolting only if sufficiently many others revolt.\n\nQuirks of Altruism and the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma\nwith Incomplete Information\n\nThe Repeated Prisoner's Dilemma has famously been used as an explanation for\nthe evolution of cooperation among non-kin (Axelrod & Hamilton, 1981; Dawkins,\n2006; Pinker, 2003; Trivers, 1971). In this section, we show how the same basic\nmodel can be used to explain many of the quirky features of our pro-social prefer-\nences and ideologies.\n\nRecall that in the Prisoner’s Dilemma, each of two players simultaneously\nchooses whether to cooperate. Cooperation reduces a player’s own payoffs by c>0\nwhile increasing the other’s payoffs by b>c. The only Nash equilibrium is for nei-\nther player to cooperate. In the Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma, the players play a\nstring of Prisoner’s Dilemmas. That is, after the players play a Prisoner’s Dilemma,\nthey learn what their opponent did and play another Prisoner’s Dilemma against the\nsame opponent with probability 6 (and the game ends with probability 1-6). As is\nwell known in the evolutionary literature, there are equilibria in which players end\nup cooperating, provided 6>c/b. In all such equilibria, cooperation is sustained\nbecause any defection by one player causes the other player to defect. This is called\nreciprocity. As the reader is surely familiar, there is ample evidence for the Repeated\nPrisoner’s Dilemma as a basis for cooperation from computer simulations (e.g.,\nAxelrod, 1984) and animal behavior (e.g., Wilkinson, 1984). The model can be\nextended to explain contributions to public goods if, after deciding whether to con-\ntribute to a public good, players play a Repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma (see, e.g.,\nPanchanathan & Boyd, 2004) (Fig. 5).\n\nThe key to understanding these quirks is that players often have incomplete\ninformation. For example:\n\n1. Players do not always observe contributions. It is intuitive that, for cooperation\nto occur in equilibrium, contributions need to be observed with sufficiently high\nprobability.\n\n2, Others cannot always tell whether a player had an opportunity to contribute. For\ndefection to be penalized, it must be the case that others can tell that a player had\nthe opportunity to cooperate and did not (.e. the player should not be able to hide\nthe fact that there was an opportunity to cooperate).\n\n3. Sometimes, there are two ways to cooperate, and one has a higher benefit, b.\nThen, the only way this more effective type of cooperation can be sustained in\nequilibrium is if others know which cooperative act is more effective.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015518",
