  "text": "CHAPTER 16\nThe Question of When\n\nThe NSA was actually concerned back in the time of the crypto-\nwars with improving American security. Nowadays, we see that\ntheir priority is weakening our security.\n\n—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2015\n\nN HIS 1974 NOVEL, Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, John Le Carré\n\nhelped establish the concept in the public imagination of a mole\nburrowing into a rival intelligence service. Le Carré’s now-classic\nmole, code-named Gerald by the KGB, managed in the novel to gain\naccess to the inner sanctum of the British intelligence service MI6.\nAided and guided by his controllers in Moscow, he systematically\nstole British intelligence secrets. As Le Carré wove the plot, the bril-\nliantly orchestrated operation involved spotting, compromising, and\nrecruiting others to gradually advance Gerald the mole to a position\nof power. Such well-organized penetrations are not limited to fiction.\nThe career of the KGB mole Heinz Felfe, who was advanced through\nthe ranks of West German intelligence by an elaborate series of sac-\nrifices by his controllers in Moscow until he actually headed West\nGerman counterintelligence in 1961, could have served as the non-\nfiction inspiration for Le Carré’s 1963 novel, The Spy Who Came\nin from the Cold. As U.S. intelligence only found out after the Cold\nWar ended, the KGB also had the ability to sustain moles for decades.\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 157 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019645",
