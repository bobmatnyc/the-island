But I go it (they even now approved you - they \nneeded to do a background check believe it or not! — as on that dinner will be president of Austria, Clinton etc) \nfor two tickets — for you and your guest for a price that you do not need to buy a table (as they do not sell \nindividual seats). \nGuy below is a good friend and he is a CEO of amFAR (amFAR has a joined dinner) — so he helped. \nThe nice thing about these tickets is that they are the most VIP. It includes reception, dinner, gala and after all \nparty access. \nI have the same ones (through Bill). \nI also got two additional for you but it turns out that they are not the same level so I reached to Kevin for help. \nThe price is 2,500Euro per ticket (this is very reduced price as I think the regular one for this is 15K and it is \nhard to get it). They will need an email from someone from your office and name a your guest asap. \nThe plan for for Vienna I am sending you with my next email! \nBoris \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 027053 \nFrom: Kevin Frost [mailto: \nSent: Monday, May 07, 2012 6:39 AM \nTo: Boris Nikolic \nSubject: Tix for Jeffrey \nImportance: High \nBoris: \nHere is the information sheet for Jeffrey to buy tickets.
