Semin, Ph.D., an\nAcademy Professor, Royal Netherlands\nAcademy of Arts and Sciences, at Utrecht\nUniversity, The Netherlands. He is the founding\nScientific Director of the Kurt Lewin Graduate\nSchool , a past president of the European\nAssociation of Experimental Social Psychology,\nand the Chair of the International Committee of\nthe Association for Psychological Science.\nSemin’s research is primarily driven by an\ninterest in communication, social cognition as\njointly recruited process, and language and the\ndiverse uses that language can be put to in social\ninteraction (ranging from the regulation of\nprejudice to that of interpersonal relationships)\nas well as the embodied grounding of meaning\nand communication.\n\nA puzzle that has occupied Semin much\nof his career is how it is possible to understand\nsocial behavior by explaining individual\nprocesses. Another puzzle has been why one\nshould focus on stills when human behavior is a\nmovie: behavior is self evidently dynamic and\nhighly responsive to contextual variations.\nFinally, Semin has been puzzled by how tt is\npossible to think that all there might be to\npsychological processes 1s some symbolic\ncomputation taking place somewhere between\nthe ears. As outlined in this essay, he has come\nto conceptualize the social in terms of jointly\nrecruited processes rather than individual ones,\nsocial behavior as situated, and psychological\nprocesses as embodied.\n\nPage |58\n\nindividual within the group, the group\nseems to be an entity of its own and the\nindividual soldier seems to have become\na cog in the social machine. Mob\nbehavior, crowds at sporting events, and\nsoldiers in formation all suggest that\nwhen we are organized to act together,\nthe group becomes an emergent entity\nthat can submerge the sense of the\nindividual self. This apparent social\nabsorption stands in contrast to our\ntypical experience of being autonomous,\nself-aware agents in the world. The\ndissolution of the boundary between the\nself and the group is one manifestation\nof the social brain and the mechanisms\nthat support our ability to connect with\nothers.\n\nAlthough not everyone has the\nexperience of marching in a band or\nrunning with a mob, most people have\nbeen part of an audience at a concert or\nplay. At the end of a particularly\nthrilling performance, an audience can\nbe moved spontaneously as a group to\nclap wildly. In these situations, we\nknow the feeling of surging to our feet as\na collective, hands clapping and faces\nbeaming with approval. As the clapping\nblooms, individual clappers merge into a\nsynchronized unit.’\"* Similarly,\nthousands of individual sports fans have\nbeen observed to stand and raise their\nhands in a synchronized fashion to\nproduce a collective wave that travels\naround the stadium. In both cases,\nindividual people act as a collective unit,\na superorganismal structure, with\ncapacities and behaviors beyond the\nreach of any single individual in the\ngroup.\n\nThese examples are instances of\nbehavioral uniformity in large groups.\nWhat is distinctive about these examples\nis that the observed behavioral\nsynchrony can be understood in terms of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021304",
