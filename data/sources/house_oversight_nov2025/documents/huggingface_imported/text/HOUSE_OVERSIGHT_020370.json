  "text": "218\n\nSnowden to come to Russia. Putin’s s decision no doubt set in motion the operation to exfiltrate\nhim on Aeroflot, the state-controlled airline.\n\nWe know that the Russian government acted in advance to facilitate Snowden’s trip from Hong\nKong. Without such an intervention, it would not be possible for an American without an entry\nvisa to Russia, or, for that matter, any other country to check-in and board an Aeroflot flight to\nMoscow. Aeroflot had to be instructed to allow Snowden on the plane without a visa. We also\nknow that a special operation was mounted to take Snowden off the plane once it landed in\nMoscow. Such an operation could not have been done without advance planning. Nor would he\nbe removed from the plane without a plan for his stay in Russia. Since Putin himself has taken\ncredit for authorizing Snowden’s trip to Russia, there is no reason to doubt that these plans, and\nwhatever cover stories were deemed necessary, were approved at the highest level of the regime.\n\nWhen an intelligence service makes such elaborate preparations for extracting a foreign\nintelligence worker, it presumably also expects to debrief him or her on arrival. Pelton, for\nexample, who had access to far less valuable information than had Snowden, was held\nincommunicado in Vienna for two weeks during his debriefing. What would be inconceivable\nwould be for an intelligence service to go to such lengths to bring a potential espionage source\nsuch as Snowden to Russia and allow him to catch the next plane to Latin America. The false\nreport provided to the press that Snowden was flying to Latin America was likely nothing more\nthan a cover story to confuse foreign observers while he was receiving his initial debriefing and\nevaluation.\n\nWhen it comes to the esoteric enterprise of reconstructing the work of U.S. signals intelligence,\nmilitary as well as civilian experts in cryptology, computer sciences and communications are\nnecessary. Unlike in the case of Pelton, Snowden had secret material in his possession, at least\naccording to Anatoly Kucherena. Even if Russian intelligence had already acquired copies of his\nelectronic files prior to Snowden’s arrival in Moscow, Snowden’s interpretation of them would be\npart of the debriefing since intelligence data needs to put in context. “This debriefing could not be\ndone overnight,” according to a former high-ranking officer in the GRU, the Russian military\nintelligence service. “There is no way that Snowden would not be fully debriefed,” he said. He\nalso said GRU specialists in signal intelligence would be called in.\n\nWe know that the Putin regime paid a significant price in terms of the cancellation of the pre-\nOlympics summit with Obama. Having to accept the onus of declining relations with the Obama\nadministration, it is hard to believe that it didn’t attempt to get the bonus of signals intelligence\nfrom Snowden. The GRU, SVR and other Russian intelligence services would not be denied the\nopportunity to y question Snowden until to all they had squeezed out of him whatever state\nsecrets he had or knew during the 38 days that he had vanished from public sight. Since\nSnowden was rewarded with sanctuary, a residence and body guards, there is no reason to doubt\nthat he satisfactorily accommodated his interrogators. While he might elect to continue believing\nthat he a whistle-blower true to his ideals, as far as Russian intelligence was concerned, he was an\nespionage source. /\n\nFor an intelligence service, the game is not over when it obtains state secrets. It still needs to\nfog over the extent of its coup, as far as possible, to prolong the value of the espionage. Hence it\nis plausible that the story that Snowden had thoroughly destroyed all his data he stolen the prior\nmonth prior to departing for Russia as well as the story that he had turned down all requests to be\nquestioned by the FSB and other Russian intelligence officials were part of his legend. The\nrepetitions of these uncorroborated claims in his press interviews also may have enhanced his\npublic image for the ACLU effort to get clemency for him. Even so, in view of the importance of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020370",
