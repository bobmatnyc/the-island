  "text": "How did I evolve through that balance and come into the place where I am today, where\nmy sexual boundaries have shifted dramatically? I'm up for trying things just to see what\nthey're like; I routinely have fantasies that would have appalled me in my teens; and I\nroutinely have orgasms as well.... But why is it that, for example, I'm very interested in\nhaving multiple partners now, but wasn't at all interested a few years ago? Why did I\ninitially swear I'd never wear a collar, then end up associating collars with profound\nsexual love? How is it that I initially considered myself solely a submissive but later\ntransitioned into an enthusiastic switch (1.e., both a sub and a domme)?\n\nHere are the two factors that, I think, facilitate sexual evolution and openness:\n1) A pressure-free environment\n\nThis is key! A person can be pressured into sexual exploration, but in my experience it\nwon't \"take.\" Many people (though not all) who feel pressure react by becoming\ndefensive and unwilling to change; even if they do try the experiment, they're less likely\nto enjoy it. And someone who has a bad sexual experience will often have trouble\nenjoying that kind of sex in the future.\n\nTake me, for example -- there were a lot of reasons why I felt less willing to experiment\nwith polyamory (multiple relationships) when I was 20, but one of the big ones is that I\nfelt lots of pressure to be poly. Because I ran in highly \"alternative\" social circles, I was\nmeeting \"polyvangelists\" who argued that polyamory is the \"best\" kind of relationship\nand that anyone who doesn't want to try poly is just being selfish or close-minded.\nGeneral social pressure exerts an influence, so it helps to have open-minded friends\nwho accept different forms of consensual sexuality -- which doesn't just mean that\n\"vanilla\" people would do well to accept those of us who are \"non-standard,\" but also\nmeans that even people in \"alternative\" circles have to accept \"mainstream\" sexuality.\n\nBut in my experience, the actual sexual relationships are the most relevant aspect of\nlife that must be sexually pressure-free. They're also one of the most difficult,\nespecially when the stakes are high: if one or both parties are helplessly in love, if they\nare married, if they have children, if they live together... then it becomes very hard to\nmake the relationship pressure-free. A husband who is afraid that his wife might leave\nhim is more likely to do sexual things for her that make him uncomfortable because he\nwants her to stay, for example -- even if she doesn't ask him to. A girl who is totally in\nlove with her boyfriend is more likely to acquiesce to sex that she's not really into,\nbecause of course she wants to please him -- but she is simultaneously unlikely to tell him\noutright that she’s not into it.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that what feels like \"pressure\" for each person will be different\ndepending on that person's triggers, the relationship, and the time in their life. Today, I\nfeel totally comfortable setting limits and clearly telling my partner \"no\" if he asks me to\ndo something I don't want to do... but it wasn't so long ago that I'd feel anxiety-inducing\npressure to do something if my boyfriend merely mentioned that he liked it. Which brings\nme to my next point: there's a fine line between sharing and pressure. One must be\ncareful when bringing up one's own preferences and desires -- which isn't to say one\nshouldn't bring them up! Merely that it's important to recognize that these are difficult\ntopics, and when we discuss them with people we love or admire, there's lots of potential\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018522",
