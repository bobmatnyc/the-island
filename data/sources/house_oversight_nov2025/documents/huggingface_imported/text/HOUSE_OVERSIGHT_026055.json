As I arrived too tired, I kept thinking, but could not remember. Just \nnow seeing your e-mail I remembered what it was!!! Your birthday!!! Please accept our best wishes for your \nnew year! \nHope you had a good celebration! \nWe had to postpone our trip to Arizona and are still in Cambridge, leaving on Wednesday.
