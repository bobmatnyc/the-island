Costs here reflect the costs\nincurred as a result of the contemplated offering.\n\n® Result of the costs of operating duplicative infrastructure at KLC and KinderCare following the KinderCare\nacquisition.\n\n7 Management fee paid to affiliate entities.\n\nRestructuring charges. Restructuring charges during the 52 weeks ended December 31, 2005, were\n$29.4 million. Included in the $29.4 million of non-recurring integration costs were $11.0 million of\nseverance costs that resulted primarily from the closure of KLC’s former corporate offices at Golden, CO.\nAdditional restructuring costs in 2005 were the result of consulting, temporary contract-based labor and\nother charges. Restructuring charges in 2004 were $5.1 million and were related to KLC’s acquisition of\nAER in May 2003.\n\nParallel_Organization Costs. For much of 2005 KLC was burdened with the central operations and\ninfrastructure of both KinderCare and KLC. KLC has defined parallel organization costs as the cost of\nmaintaining these duplicative corporate functions during the overhead rationalization associated with the\nKinderCare acquisition. KLC believes that approximately 70% of parallel organization costs are related to\nsalaries. Remaining parallel organization costs are related to upkeep, maintenance and utilities at\ncorporate facilities. During the first month of 2006 parallel organization costs had been reduced to\n$174,042 (annualized run-rate of $2.1 million) compared to an estimated $23.3 million in 2005.\n\nParallel organization costs for the 2004 fiscal year are estimated based on an annualized run-rate based\non the costs incurred during the first month following the KinderCare acquisition. During that month\n(January 2005), KLC incurred approximately $2.3 million of parallel organization costs ($28.1 million on\nan annualized run-rate basis).\n\nInterest. Interest expense in 2004 and 2005 is almost identical because both years are pro forma for the\nfinancings associated with the Real Estate Transaction, which refinanced the indebtedness incurred to\nfinance the KinderCare acquisition. In 2005 pro forma interest expense of $89.9 million includes $5.1\nmillion of non-cash interest expense. Actual interest expense during the 2005 fiscal year was $80.7\nmillion which did not include $32.2 million related to the early extinguishment of debt.\n\n80\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024513",
