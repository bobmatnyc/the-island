I just sent an additional email which moderates this.. everyone was a victim, including Jeffrey here.. and\nthere was no happy resolution.. please add.. \"probably everyone was a victim, with no happy resolution or\nconsequences of these activities\", after \"was the victim in this case.”.\n\nOn Apr 6, 2011, at 10:18 AM, Rebecca Watson wrote:\n\nOkay, thanks for this statement . . .

I believe him when he told me he had no idea the girls were\nunderage, and I doubt that people normally are asked for or present a driver's license under such\ncircumstances... Moreover, I also believe that Jeffrey is an easy target for those who want to take advantage\nof him... Moreover, I can say with great honesty that Jeffrey's time in prison led him to seriously examine\nhis life in very positive ways and I don't believe in blanket condemnations of people. He served time for\nsomething that was determined was inappropriate. I honestly don't know who was the victim in this case. I\nfully expect that these masseuses knew what they were doing, and were not swayed to do anything with\nJeffrey that they were not already doing. That is not to approve of the whole behavior, but lots of peoplel\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031022",
