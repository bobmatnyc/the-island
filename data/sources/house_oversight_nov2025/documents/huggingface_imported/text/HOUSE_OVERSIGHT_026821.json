  "text": "Argentina: Elections in October bring little clarity to\nfuture\n\n- The August 9 mandatory open primaries (PASO) brought little clarity as to who will\nsucceed President Cristina Kirchner in the October 25 elections. She has held office\nsince 2007 and, before that, her husband held the presidency from 2003-06.\n\n- Kirchner’s handpicked successor, current governor of Buenos Aires province, Daniel\nScioli (of the Peronist faction) leads in the elections held last week. But the 2\"? and 3'¢\nplace finishers could band together to pull off a victory.\n\n- The Argentine economy has seen zero growth this year. FDI has declined 41 percent\nand inflation stands at 30 percent. Voters remain deeply divided over which candidate\nand which economic policy to support. We expect continued problems for the\nforeseeable future.\n\nRepsol Oil Co,\n© Paris Club\n\nOW Muttilaterat funding organizations\n\nW) Private debt tenants\n\n“You’re only going to get this much back. . .”\n\nInflation and recession are clobbering the\naverage Argentinean.\n\nSource: Straftor\n\nDeutsche Bank Francis J.
