  "text": "reforms in the name of “nation building.” Yet the newly-installed\nregimes owed their existence to denying freedoms that would rally\ndissidents to overthrow them. So the democratization America\nencouraged was doomed from the start.\n\nThen came the “abandon.” Time and time again, when the\ngovernments America had nurtured and praised faced resistance or\nrebellion, Washington deserted their leaders, citing the popular excuse\nthat their repressive measures were enslaving their own people.\n\nSupporting leaders when they kept the Middle East stable, then\ndumping them when they failed to adopt Western ideals, was a\nblueprint for disaster. And it’s disaster that ensued. Many of those\nstrongmen——from Mubarak in Egypt to Gaddafi in Libya——have\nfallen. Once dominated by repressive but stable nation-states, vast\nswaths of the Middle East are now borderless, a hodge-podge of\nterritories controlled by warring factions that’s a throwback to its\ntribal past.\n\nThe search for a solution to this chaos requires a clear understanding\nof how we got here in the first place.\n\nFor centuries, the Ottoman Empire had neutralized the historically\nrooted sectarian divisions within Islam. Those divisions stem from its\nancient political legacy as a “caliphate,” a religious state with united by\nmilitary might, but with constantly shifting borders. Following the\nOttoman collapse after World War I, European colonial powers\nassumed the role of regional administrator, and colluded to redraw\nboundaries (i.e. Sykes-Picot) in the Middle-East to create nation states\nthat satisfied competing Western interests. Those newly-created\nnations, occupying territories defined by legal borders, ignored Arab\nhistory and tribal custom. Modern Western notions of distinct nations\nbound together by geography, language, self-determination or political\nideals been relevant in the Arab world.
