  "text": "consider whether the case involves a possibly widespread\nindustry practice that should be addressed, whether the\ncase involves a recidivist, and whether the matter gives SEC\nan opportunity to be visible in a community that might not\notherwise be familiar with SEC or the protections afforded\nby the securities laws.\n\nFor more information about the Enforcement\nDivision’s procedures concerning investigations, enforce-\nment actions, and cooperation with other regulators, see\nthe Enforcement Manual at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/\n\nenforce.shtml.\n\nSelf-Reporting, Cooperation, and\nRemedial Efforts\n\nWhile the conduct underlying any FCPA investiga-\ntion is obviously a fundamental and threshold consider-\nation in deciding what, if any, action to take, both DOJ\nand SEC place a high premium on self-reporting, along\nwith cooperation and remedial efforts, in determining the\n\nappropriate resolution of FCPA matters.\n\nCriminal Cases\n\nUnder DOJ’s Principles of Federal Prosecution of\nBusiness Organizations, federal prosecutors consider a\ncompany’s cooperation in determining how to resolve a\ncorporate criminal case. Specifically, prosecutors consider\nwhether the company made a voluntary and timely dis-\nclosure as well as the company’s willingness to provide rel-\nevant information and evidence and identify relevant actors\ninside and outside the company, including senior execu-\ntives. In addition, prosecutors may consider a company’s\nremedial actions, including efforts to improve an existing\ncompliance program or appropriate disciplining of wrong-\ndoers.*? A company’s remedial measures should be mean-\ningful and illustrate its recognition of the seriousness of the\nmisconduct, for example, by taking steps to implement the\npersonnel, operational, and organizational changes neces-\nsary to establish an awareness among employees that crimi-\nnal conduct will not be tolerated.?*\n\nThe Principles of Federal Prosecution similarly provide\n\nthat prosecutors may consider an individual’s willingness\n\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\n\nto cooperate in deciding whether a prosecution should\nbe undertaken and how it should be resolved. Although a\nwillingness to cooperate will not, by itself, generally relieve\na person of criminal liability, it may be given “serious con-\nsideration” in evaluating whether to enter into a plea agree-\nment with a defendant, depending on the nature and value\nof the cooperation offered”\n\nThe US. Sentencing Guidelines similarly take into\naccount an individual defendant’s cooperation and volun-\ntary disclosure. Under § 5K1.1, a defendant’s cooperation,\nif sufficiently substantial, may justify the government filing\na motion for a reduced sentence. And under § 5K2.16, a\ndefendant’s voluntary disclosure of an offense prior to its\ndiscovery—if the offense was unlikely to have been discov-\nered otherwise—may warrant a downward departure in\ncertain circumstances.\n\nChapter 8 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which gov-\nerns the sentencing of organizations, takes into account an\norganization’s remediation as part of an “effective compli-\nance and ethics program.” One of the seven elements of\nsuch a program provides that after the detection of crimi-\nnal conduct, “the organization shall take reasonable steps\nto respond appropriately to the criminal conduct and to\nprevent further similar criminal conduct, including mak-\ning any necessary modifications to the organization’s\ncompliance and ethics program.” Having an effective\ncompliance and ethics program may lead to a three-point\nreduction in an organization’s culpability score under\n§ 8C2.5, which affects the fine calculation under the\nGuidelines. Similarly, an organization’s self-reporting,\ncooperation, and acceptance of responsibility may lead to\nfine reductions under § 8C2.5(g) by decreasing the culpa-\nbility score. Conversely, an organization will not qualify\nfor the compliance program reduction when it unreason-\n\nably delayed reporting the offense.” Similar to § 5K1.1\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022556",
