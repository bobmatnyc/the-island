  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nMy colleague insisted that the young man had a moral obligation to his fiancé and a legal\nobligation to the police to be truthful.\n\nAt first, the young man refused, but my colleague, after conferring with me, told him he really had\nno choice, because she would be obligated to report his continuing crime of making a false\nreport—a crime that endangered the life and liberty of anyone fitting the made-up description of\nthe black man with the shark’s tooth. (The young man didn’t want to get the man with whom he\nhad consensual sex in trouble, so he invoked the stereotype of the “black man” rapist.) My\ncolleague told him that she would try to make a deal with the police under which he wouldn’t be\ncharged with a crime in exchange for telling the truth.\n\nThe young man then told the police and his fiancé the truth. The police called off the all points\nbulletin, and my colleague persuaded the police not to press charges against the young man. I do\nnot know how the engagement worked out, but I do know that I learned a great deal from this\nexperience about the complexities of sexual encounters and the need to subject claims of rape to\nthe usual probing of the adversarial process.\n\n250\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017337",
