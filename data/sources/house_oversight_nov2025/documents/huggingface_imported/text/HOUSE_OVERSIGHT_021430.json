  "text": "° Later, in a regular column for the school paper, she described her experiences with you, without\nmentioning you by name. “There was even one particular creep of a professor who once told me he thought\ndifferently of me compared to other students and asked me to dinner: a situation so disturbing that it left me\nupset for weeks afterward,” she wrote.\n\n° She was then approached by a dean at the university, who suspected that she was referring to you,\nbased on a previously reported incident with another student. He encouraged her to make a complaint, and\nshe did.\n\n° University investigators interviewed both you and the student.\n\n° On September 4, 2008, Susan Nickel-Schindewolf, the university’s associate vice president for student\naffairs, wrote to the student, telling her that the investigation was complete. She wrote that you had been told:\n“This type of behavior could constitute sexual harassment in violation of the university’s sexual harassment\npolicy.”\n\n° The letter also stated that you were prohibited from making contact with the student as long as she\nremained at Case.\n\n° The letter also stated that you are required to get approval from the dean or the chair of the physics\ndepartment before setting foot on the campus again.\n\n° The letter also stated, “Dr. Krauss expressed regret about having a negative impact on you, and also\nhis willingness to use this complaint as an opportunity to reflect and improve on his future interactions with\nstudents.”\n\n° By then, you had already left Case, taking up your current position at Arizona State University the\nmonth before.\n\n° “The opportunities being offered at ASU are simply too great to turn down at this stage in my career,”\nyou told Case colleagues, in an email announcing your departure on April 16, 2008.\n\nIncident 3:\n\n° A former Case Western physics department administrator confirmed that she had reported a previous\nincident involving a student who had confided in her about your inappropriate behavior towards her.\n\nIncident 4:\n\n° You met a student from another university, an atheist activist, in March 2008 at the American Atheists\nConvention in Minneapolis. She wanted to expand the atheist group she ran at the midwestern university she\nwas attending, and hoped to convince you to come and speak. You initially seemed enthusiastic.\n\n° During the convention, attendees including you and Richard Dawkins went for dinner with the student\nand volunteers for Dawkins’ foundation.\n\n° Afterwards, the student invited you to join the volunteers for a drink.\n\n° You asked her to come get you in your hotel room. She was wary of your intentions, and so brought a\nmale friend with her. Opening the door to find them both there, you informed her you had decided not to go.\n° You met this student again at the American Atheists Convention in Des Moines, lowa, in April 2011.\n\n° You pulled over a chair for her in the bar, and then started running your hand up her leg under the\ntable.\n\n° She tried to shift her body away from you, and you persisted in putting your hand on her leg. She\n\ncrossed her legs, and you kept trying. Then she turned her entire body away.\n\nIncident 5:\n\n° This incident allegedly occurred on in May 2011 on a CFI cruise. We understand that CFI staff were\ninformed that you had propositioned a female cruise-goer, who rejected an invitation to join you and your\nfemale companion for sex in your cabin.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021430",
