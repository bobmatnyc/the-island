  "text": "In FY 2013, OGIS began looking at several specific issues regarding agency\npolicies, procedures, and compliance, including FOIA fees and fee waivers, and the\nways agencies process records related to immigration matters. OGIS also began\na “Preventing Litigation” project, working with agencies on ways to reduce their\nchances of a request resulting in litigation.\n\nGAO recommended that OGIS establish a time frame for completing and\nimplementing a methodology that defines, among other things, the scope,\nschedule, criteria, and evaluation questions for reviewing Federal agencies’\nFOIA policies, procedures, and compliance. OGIS had already begun creating\na draft assessment framework, which will form one piece of OGIS’s expanded\nreview methodology.\n\nGAO’s recommendation mirrored that of the National Archives and\nRecords Administration’s Inspector General (IG), which conducted\n\na routine review of OGIS in FY 2012 to determine whether OGIS was\n\nadequately established and meets Congress’s intent. The IG report,\ncompleted in September 2012, found that OGIS meets the requirements set\n\nforth in FOIA with regard to both review and dispute resolution. The IG\nfound that “additional resources could significantly improve OGIS’s ability\nto address and meet its mission.”\n\nIn response to the GAO recommendations, NARA concurred with both\n\nrecommendations and will work to address them in FY 2014.\n\nreleases report on OGIS along with two Le - al —\nrecommendations #\nSeptember 18-20 ; ‘A\nDirector Nisbet represents the National f z|\nArchives and Records Administration at the\n\nbiennial International Conference of Information qa\nCommissioners in Berlin | Ate\n\nPatent drawing for R.H.
