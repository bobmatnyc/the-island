  "text": "152 Teaching Minds\n\nIt is not an unreasonable question to ask whether being a USS.\nsenator prepares you to be president. It would not have been odd if\nPalin had asked Couric whether we ever had a president who actually\nwas prepared for the job. Other than vice presidents who work closely\nwith a president for 4 years or more, it is not unreasonable to assert\nthat we have a history of unprepared presidents. But she didn’t say\nthat because preparedness is a causative notion and Palin doesn’t seem\nto get causation. She may be bright enough to have been taught about\ncausation when she was small, but apparently this didn’t happen. As a\nresult, she seems stupid to those who do understand causation.\n\nPalin recently has made statements that make you wonder where\nher ideas about causation come from. This is from a 2009 interview\non ABC:\n\nWalters: Now let’s talk about some issues—the Middle East. The\nObama Administration does not want Israel to build any\nmore settlements on what they consider Palestinian territory.\nWhat is your view on this?\n\nPalin: I disagree with the Obama Administration on that. I\nbelieve that, um, the Jewish settlements should be allowed to\nbe expanded upon because the population of Israel is going\nto grow. More and more Jewish people will be flocking to\nIsrael in the days and weeks and months ahead.\n\nWhat is the problem here? Again, there is a question of causation, but\nit is more obvious that that is the issue. No one who hears this state-\nment would fail to ask why Jews would be flocking to Israel in the\nweeks and months ahead.\n\nIt is important to understand that determination of causation is\nthe backbone of an intelligently thought out belief system. People be-\nlieve certain things. They believe that the sun will rise in the morning\nand that their parents will come home from work at night. Beliefs\noften are based on observation and generalization. People also are\ntaught beliefs. There are many ways to acquire beliefs. Children get\nthem from their parents mostly but also from friends and siblings.\nAt some point, however, reality comes into play. Reality often means\ncomparing a belief with what you know or can figure out about causa-\ntion. You can believe that the sun rises each morning but not know its\ncause. And, of course, you can learn the cause. You can believe that the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023898",
