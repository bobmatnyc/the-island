  "text": "capabilities emerge from regular physical processses, which we can trace down to the\nlevel of electrons, photons, quarks, and gluons. Evidently, brute matter can get pretty\nsmart.\n\nLet me summarize the argument. From two strongly supported hypotheses, we’ve\ndrawn a straightforward conclusion:\n\ne Human mind emerges from matter.\n\ne Matter is what physics says it is.\n\ne Therefore, the human mind emerges from physical processes we\nunderstand and can reproduce artificially.\n\ne Therefore, natural intelligence is a special case of artificial\nintelligence.\n\nOf course, our “astonishing corollary” could fail; the first two lines of this\nargument are hypotheses. But their failure would have to bring in a foundation-shattering\ndiscovery—a significant new phenomenon, with large-scale physical consequences,\nwhich takes place in unremarkable, well-studied physical circumstances (1.e., the\nmaterials, temperatures, and pressures inside human brains) yet which has somehow\nmanaged for many decades to elude determined investigators armed with sophisticated\ninstruments. Such a discovery would be. . . astonishing.\n\nID. The Future of Intelligence\n\nIt is part of human nature to improve on human bodies and minds. Historically, clothing,\neyeglasses, and watches are examples of increasingly sophisticated augmentations that\nenhance our toughness, perception, and awareness. They are major improvements to the\nnatural human endowment, whose familiarity should not blind us to their depth. Today\nsmartphones and the Internet are bringing the human drive toward augmentation into\nrealms more central to our identity as intelligent beings. They are giving us, in effect,\nquick access to a vast collective awareness and a vast collective memory.\n\nAt the same time, autonomous artificial intelligences have become world\nchampions in a wide variety of “cerebral” games, such as chess and Go, and have taken\nover many sophisticated pattern-recognition tasks, such as reconstructing what happened\nduring complex reactions at the Large Hadron Collider from a blizzard of emerging\nparticle tracks, to find new particles; or gathering clues from fuzzy X-ray, fMRI, and\nother types of images, to diagnose medical problems.\n\nWhere is this drive toward self-enhancement and innovation taking us? While the\nprecise sequence of events and the timescale over which they’ll play out is impossible to\npredict (or, at least, beyond me), some basic considerations suggest that eventually the\nmost powerful embodiments of mind will be quite different things from human brains as\nwe know them today.\n\nConsider six factors whereby information-processing technology exceeds human\ncapabilities—vastly, qualitatively, or both:\n\ne Speed: The orchestrated motion of electrons, which is the heart of modern\nartificial information-processing, can be much faster than the processes of\ndiffusion and chemical change by which brains operate. Typical modern\ncomputer clock rates approach 10 gigahertz, corresponding to 10 billion\noperations per second. No single measure of speed applies to the bewildering\nvariety of brain processes, but one fundamental limitation is latency of action\n\n58\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016278",
