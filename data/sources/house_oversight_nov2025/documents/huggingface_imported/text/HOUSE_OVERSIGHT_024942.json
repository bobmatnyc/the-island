  "text": "Dubai model will go down the river. I am fully aware that some financial and economic circles were not happy\nwith the progress we managed to achieve on various tracks including investment, aviation industry, IT and\nglobal competition in mana ging and financial markets.\n\nThe UAE has proven remarkable competency in addressing difficult questions imposed by the global financial\ncrisis. I strongly believe it won’t be long before international focus will shift from what is claimed to be\nDubai’s shortcomings to Dubai’s and the UAE’s overall success in passing this difficult test.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nAlmost a year ago, and during your visit to Asia, you warned against the global financial\ncrisis. Why precautionary measures have not been undertaken to avoid negative impacts\nof this crisis on both Dubai and UAE?\n\nThe crisis have taken the whole world by surprise and evolved in tremendous pace. During my visit to Asia, I\nhad warned against turmoil in financial and commodities markets, marginalizing the role of international\nfinancial institutions and potentials that these institutions fall short from fulfilling their expected roles ina\nworld where all international markets became very much related, turning into one huge global market which\ndoes not follow any international rules, regulations or supervision.\n\nI had urged leading world economies to move swiftly and reconsider roles and mechanisms of international\nfinancial establishments and institutions, especially the International Monetary Fund -- and that what exactly\nthe G20 summit did last month earlier this month.\n\nRegarding the precautionary measures, I believe that no preventive measures neither i1n the UAE or any other\ncountry in the world, would have provided the desired immunity from the ramifications of the global financial\nmeltdown. The UAE’s solid economic structure, efficient performing establishments, adoption of a balanced\nmodel of conservative banking policies overseen by the Federal Central Bank and liberal economic approach,\nwere the key elements that enhanced the country’s ability to survive the negative implications of the global\ncrisis and prevented any case of bankruptcy in any of the country’s banks or major corporations. The impact of\nthe crisis on our economy was significant during the last quarter of 2008, yet it was not as harsh as on other\nmajor economies.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nDespite Dubai government officials repeated rebuffs of bailing out some companies to\nAbu Dhabi, speculations in that regard have never stopped. Isn’t normal for the\nEmirates to cooperate among themselves to overcome such difficult times?\n\nCooperation among the seven Emirates has never stopped and they don’t wait for crises to show this\ncooperation. There are several joint ventures between Abu Dhabi and Dubai. Founders and stakeholders of\nmost of the UAE Public Joint Stock companies are from Dubai and Abu Dhabi. Abu Dhabi investors have huge\ninvestments in Dubai and vice versa. Dubai has always welcomed business and investments from across the\nUAE.\n\nRegarding the speculations you referred to in your question, they will always remain just speculations. I believe\nthey are meant to be evil gossip as part of a vicious campaign against Dubai model. These speculations were not\nonly refuted by Dubai government officials but also by His Highness the President of the UAE last March.\n\nBy Al-Sharq al-Awsat Daily\n\nDo you believe that the UAE economy will contract this year? Or will it achieve certain\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024942",
