  "text": "these reform efforts. These leaders need and deserve active, engaged\nUS support. Yet America’s recent retreat from the region, following\nclumsy attempts at nation building, has destabilized and discouraged\nits allies.\n\nIran is supporting militias in Iraq, Syria and Yemen whose stated\npurpose is to eradicate Israel. That threat may create what has been a\npreviously unthinkable alliance between our Gulf Cooperating Council\npartners and Israel. It’s in the interest of all these allies, including\nSaudi Arabia, Egypt, Palestine, other GCC members, along with Israel,\nto join forces. That alliance would provide a countervailing balance to\nthe Revolutionary Guard in Iran, the ISIS caliphate and the aggressive\naspiration of Turkey, which is further fueled by a renewed Russian\npush.\n\nThe competition for a caliphate has more contestants than just Iran,\nincluding ISIS, of course, as well as Turkey, and the Muslim\nBrotherhood. As the US withdraws, Russia is taking its place as the\nnon-Arab power player in the Middle East. The chill in US-Russia\nrelations has left President Putin free to defy Washington. Without\npredictable US-support, our allies may have only one direction to turn\nas Russia capitalizes on every USA misstep in the region.\n\nThe emerging alliance between Putin and Turkey’s Erdogan has\nevolved in perfect Kissingerian fashion; sovereign relationships can be\nas ephemeral as their counterparties’ interests. And now that Russia\nand Turkey seem to have a growing relationship, a counterbalancing\nalignment needs to be crafted between the GCC and the Arab nations.\n\nThe Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has been our longest and strongest ally\nand, to many Westerners’ amazement, it is impossible for the US to\nmove against any hostile Islamic group anywhere in the world without\nSaudi support. Almost two billion Muslims look to Mecca and Medina\nas their spiritual heartland and challenging any faction of Islam\nwithout the support of its guardian, Saudi Arabia, would be foolhardy.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031721",
