  "text": "are paid $40,000 per year and get two weeks of vacation per year ($40,000 divided by [40 hours per\nweek x 50 = 2,000] = $20/hour). Estimate your hourly income by cutting the last three zeroes off of your\nannual income and halving the remaining number (e.g., $50,000/year p $25/hour.\n\n2. Estimate the amount of time you will save by grouping similar tasks together and batching them, and\ncalculate how much you have earned by multiplying this hour number by your per-hour rate ($20 here):\n\n1 x per week: 10 hours = $200\nIx pertwoweeks: 20 hours = $400\n\n1 x per month: 40 hours = S800\n\n3. Test each of the above batching frequencies and determine how much problems cost to fix in each\nperiod. If the cost is less than the above dollar amounts, batch even further apart.\n\nFor example, using our above math, if I check e-mail once per week and that results in an average loss\nof two sales per week, totaling $80 in lost profit, I will continue checking once per week because $200\n(10 hours of time) minus $80 is still a $120 net gain, not to mention the enormous benefits of completing\nother main tasks in those 10 hours. If you calculate the financial and emotional benefit of completing just\none main task (such as landing a major client or completing a life-changing trip), the value of batching is\nmuch more than the per-hour savings.\n\nIf the problems cost more than hours saved, scale back to the next-less-frequent batch schedule. In this\ncase, I would drop from once per week to twice per week (not daily) and attempt to fix the system so that\nI can return to once per week. Do not work harder when the solution is working smarter. I have batched\nboth personal and business tasks further and further apart as [ve realized just how few real problems\ncome up. Some of my scheduled batches in 2007 were e-mail (Mondays 10:00 A.M.), phone (completely\neliminated), laundry (every other Sunday at 10:00 P.M), credit cards and bills (most are on automatic\npayment, but I check balances every second Monday after e-mail), strength training (every 4th day for\n30 minutes), etc.\n\nEmpowerment Failure: Rules and Readjustment\n\nThe vision is really about empowering workers, giving them all the information about what’s\ngoing on so they can do a lot more than they’ve done in the past.\n\n—BILL GATES, cofounder of Microsoft, richest man in the world\n\nEb inpowermen failure refers to being unable to accomplish a task without first obtaining permission or\ninformation. It is often a case of being micromanaged or micromanaging someone else, both of which\nconsume your time.\n\nFor the employee, the goal is to have full access to necessary information and as much independent\ndecision-making ability as possible. For the entrepreneur, the goal is to grant as much information and\nindependent decision-making ability to employees or contractors as possible.\n\nCustomer service is often the epitome of empowerment failure, and a personal example from\nBrainQUICKEN illustrates just how serious but easily solved the problem can be.\n\nIn 2002, I had outsourced customer service for order tracking and returns but still handled product-\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013862",
