We also\nsee the position as being complementary to our EM position since whereas a stronger\nUSD is a drag on EM performance, it is beneficial for the NKY position.\n\nChart 31: Japan equities have outperformed during US bear-steepening led by cyclicals, banks and\ninsurance\n\n125 Japan Sector = cyclical outperform on\n10 4 UST bear-steepening\n8\n6\n4\n2\na\n2\n4\n6\n8\n-10\n424\nUSDJPY DXY MSCI JP MSCI JP/ Discretionary Financials Materials IT Industrials Energy Telecom Staples Utilities Health care\nex JP\nm Bear steep = Bear flat mBull steep = Bull flat\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg.\n\nCurve movements based on 2yr move and 2510s move (Bloomberg US Treasury yield index), so includes twist movernents, but even if we exclude these implications do not materially change.\nBear steepening (2yr + 16bps, 2510s +33bps) = 11 quarters, bear flattening (2yr +26bps, 2510s -20bps) = 10 quarters, bull steepening (2yr -48bps, 2510s +28bps) = 10 quarters, bull flattening (2yr -\n27 ps, 2510s -30bps) = 12 quarters\n\nLong Europe equities via yield stocks & index dividends\n\nWe continue to run two yield related trades in European equities. First, we remain long a\nbroad selection of high yielding European equities. The dividend yield on offer in\nEuropean equities is one of the asset class’s key attractions. Europe offers a higher\ndividend yield than the other regions, with a 1.1% yield pick-up versus the DM average\nand 0.9% against EM equities. Those also look attractive relative to history: Europe’s\nyield spread to DM ranks at the 87\" percentile of the 20-year range. Europe’s DY also\nlooks attractive relative to sovereign and corporate bonds despite the recent sell off in\nfixed income markets: the yield pick-up relative to investment grade corporates is still\n289bp. Given the concerns over European politics we prefer yield based strategies in\nEurope to those looking for capital appreciation at least in the short term.\n\nChart 32: Equity DYs remain attractive relative to credit & sov bond Chart 33: Europe offers a yield premium vs global equities too\n\nyields 20\n\n1.5\n1.0\n0.5\n0.0\n0.5\n-1.0\n\n-1.5\n\n~ ====—=Stoxx 600 DY less 10yr Bund yield 20\n\n== |MSCl Europe less\nEM DY spread\n\n——— SCI Europe less\nDM DY spread\n\n3 t-------2-------------- SezeerStonK 600 DY less Euro.G ctedtt yield 12/80 12/84 12/88 12/92 12/96 12/00 12/04 12/08 12/12\n200 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 Source: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, MSCI, Datastream\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research, Bloomberg, Datastream\n\nEuropean Yield Screen\n\nThe rising rates backdrop has left yield not quite as scarce as it has been, but we\ncontinue to think investors should own yield where they can get it at decent value, such\nas in European equities.
