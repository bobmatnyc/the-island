  "text": "consent. Not a partner who says, \"Okay, I guess,\" in a bored tone, but doesn't actively\nsay \"no.\" Not a partner who is silent and non-reactive, but doesn't actively stop you when\nyou start having sex with them. Not a partner who seems hesitant, or anxious, or\nconfused. Enthusiastic consent means an enthusiastic partner: one who is responding\npassionately, kissing you back, saying things like \"Yes\" or \"Oh my God, don't stop”... or\na partner who talks to you ahead of time about what will happen, as many BDSMers and\nsex workers do, and knows how to safeword or otherwise get out of the situation if you do\nsomething they don't like.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are critiques within feminism of the concept of enthusiastic\nconsent. For example, some feminist sex workers point out that when they have sex for\nmoney, their consent is not exactly \"enthusiastic,\" but they still feel that their consent is\nreal consent, and that their choices must be respected. The same goes for some asexual\npeople. Asexuality is commonly defined as \"not feeling sexual attraction to others,\" but\nsome asexual people have romantic relationships with other people in which they have\nsex entirely to satisfy their partner, and some of them have said that they don't feel\nincluded by feminist discussions of enthusiastic consent.\n\nHey, even some of my non-asexual, non-sex worker friends have problems with the idea\nthat they aren't \"really\" consenting unless they're super-enthusiastic about the sexual act\nat hand. A married friend once commented wryly that if she and her husband always\ndemanded 100% enthusiastic consent from each other, then the marriage would fall apart.\nBut as we continued to discuss it, she and her husband both agreed that they have zero\nproblem with the situation as it stands.\n\nI don't want to sweep those critiques under the rug. I figure that as long as everyone's\ncommunicating about the situation openly, and working to keep things relatively low-\npressure, then consent is likely to happen, even if it's not perfectly “enthusiastic.” I've had\nextensive debates on the topic with other feminists, though, and I often seek more,\nbecause honing consent theory is one of my favorite things!\n\nAll this having been said: the concept of enthusiastic consent has been very helpful for\nme personally. I know that it's also been helpful for an enormous number of other people\nwho are trying to understand boundaries in their sexual relationships. I absolutely believe\nthat enthusiastic consent is an important and useful standard, and I do my best to observe\nthat standard as much as I can in my own relationships. So, while I think some critiques\nare reasonable, I also think that the idea of enthusiastic consent is the best baseline\nassumption to start these conversations... if not to end them.\n\n7) In practice, as long as everyone involved is having consensual fun, criticism is\nsecondary. Practically speaking, consent is the most important thing; from a pragmatic\nstandpoint, the question of whether sexuality arises from biology or culture doesn't matter\nnearly as much. (I find the question of whether BDSM can be categorized as a sexual\norientation to be more politically and theoretically interesting than practically important.)\n\nUnderstanding sexual biology or culture may help us grasp some of the complexities of\nconsent. For example, people often have trouble saying \"no\" to things directly: when was\nthe last time you explicitly said \"no\" when you didn't want to do something?
