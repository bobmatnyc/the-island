In his videos, he sings every part, plays every instrument and visualizes every\ncomponent with a captivating vision.\n\nJacob Collier is nothing short of prodigious. A two-time Grammy-winning singer, arranger, composer, and multi-instrumentalist, he\ncombines everything from jazz and a cappella to classical and Brazilian music. In 2014, he was discovered by the legendary producer\nQuincy Jone. Shortly after, Collier began working on his audio-visual live performance vehicle designed and built at MIT.\n\nSince his first video in 2011, Collier has amassed more than 250K international followers and 10 million YouTube views, including on his\nastounding cover of Stevie Wonder's \"Don't You Worry ‘Bout a Thing.” In July 2016, Collier released his chart-topping debut album, Jn My\nRoom.

With its easy availability, durability and endless recyclability, she realized, there was a reason its use\nhas persisted for thousands of years.\n\nSince then, Heringer’s love affair with sustainable materials has deepened, resulting in acclaimed projects like woven bamboo hostels in\nChina and the METI Handmade School in Rudrapur, where, along with local workers and schoolchildren, she created a building that drew\non locally abundant materials and fostered modern, sustainable building skills in local craftsmen. In the 2014 book, The Future of\nArchitecture, she and her coauthors argue for a future that is low-impact and adaptable.\n\nanna-heringer.com @AnnaHeringer\n\nGrace Kim\n\nPage 13 of 21\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014963",
