  "text": "NAUTILUS EDUCATION | BETA PRODUCT\n\nChemistry & Fuels\n\nThe matter in our world is recycled. The pair of articles here explores how elements and atoms\nwend their way through space and time. Students will explore how chemical reactions usher ele-\nments through their journeys. You Are Made of Waste illustrates, in five short vignettes, the lives of\nthe elements that make up our teeth, fi breath, hair,and blood. Frack ‘er Upisanin-depth\nlook at the botched promise of biofuel—energy from cars made from renewable plant growth.\n\nIn the “curriculum” section of the teacher’s notes, you will find information on how these pieces\ncan help fulfill requirements of the Next Generation Science Standards. Specifically, they make\nfor entry pomts to—or a means of reinforcing—lessons on photosynthesis, chemical reactions,\nvalence electrons, and energy. But more than that, these lessons will connect to the students’ daily\nlives, and spark discussion.\n\nLesson Plan:\n\nAsk students to read one or both of the articles for homework. Briefly introduce or review the vocabulary words\nin class. Assign all or a selection of the reading comprehension questions for the students to complete along\nwith the reading, and ask them to come up with one question for further discussion. (Note that a couple of the\nquestions for each article are redundant.)\n\nStart class with students raising any technical questions they might have about the readings. Ask them to\ncontribute their discussion questions, and write these on the board, along with the questions provided in the\nteacher’s notes. Ask the students to break into small groups; assign each group to address a question, and\nbriefly present to the class for further discussion. 30-45 MIN\n\nIn the following class time (or another class) have the students complete one or more of the activities in the\nteacher’s notes in small groups. 30 MIN\n\nTeacher’s Notes: You Are Made of Waste\n\nVOCAB WORDS\n\nMass: a physical property that describes an object’s Radioactive decay: the process by which a nucleus\nresistance to force.
