  "text": "KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n\nJohn Roth, Esq.\nJune 19, 2008\nPage 5\n\nFinally, as you know, Mr. Epstein and the USAO entered into an agreement that deferred\nprosecution to the State. In this regard, I simply note that the manner in which this agreement\nwas negotiated contrasts sharply with Mr. Sloman’s current representation that “/T]he SDFL\nindicated a willingness to defer to the State the length of incarceration...” See Tab 1, May 19,\n2008 Letter from J. Sloman, p. 2. This statement is simply not true. Contrary to Mr. Sloman’s\nassertion, federal prosecutors refused to accept what the State believed to be appropriate as to\nMr. Epstein’s sentence and instead, insisted that Mr. Epstein be required serve a two-year term of\nimprisonment (which they later decreased to 18 months plus one year of house arrest). Federal\nprosecutors have not only involved themselves in what is quintessentially a state matter, but their\nactions have caused a critical appearance of impropriety that raises doubt as to their motivation\nfor investigating and prosecuting Mr. Epstein in the first place.\n\nAt bottom, we appreciate your willingness to review this matter with a fresh—and\nindependent—set of eyes. To facilitate your review, I once again request the opportunity to\nmake an oral presentation to supplement our written submissions, and we will promptly respond\nto any inquiries you may have.\n\ncc: Deputy Attorney General Mark Filip\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012140",
