We continue to see a call on OPEC of 4.1mn bpd in the next five\nyears to “balance the market”, and see oil prices of US$55-75/bbl over 2016-2020.\nAlthough the NTP incorporates a target of boosting domestic gas production by 50% to\n18 bcf/d by 2020 which could crowd out oil demand, we expect Saudi Arabia’s ability to\nswitch to reduce oil burn in power generation to 2020 to be quite limited, in our view.\n\nWe see oil averaging US$55-75/bbl over 2016-2020\n\nReal Brent prices are at one of the lowest levels in decades, and will likely encourage\nvery strong demand growth ahead, while we see supply falling across non-cartelized\nproducers. As such, we see global light sweet crude oil averaging US$55 to USS75/bbl\nover the 2016-2020 period, depending on how much incremental production OPEC can\nand will supply over the next five years. We think it likely that Saudi will dig into its\nuntested spare capacity to go for increased market share, though uncertainty over how\nmuch Saudi can and will produce remains. We also remain concerned about output\nsustainability among weaker cartel members given the rapid credit profile deterioration.\n\n36 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016146",
