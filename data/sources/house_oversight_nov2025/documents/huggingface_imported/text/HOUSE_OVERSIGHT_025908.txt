Kathy

We will of course do this in whatever sequence makes sense for you. It goes without saying that any move
would need to make economic sense. My assumption has been that your comp would fall outside of our "bell
curve", but that is not an issue for us as long as the potential contribution also falls outside. You would not be
the only partner outside the curve, and I am comfortable with expanding that group for people who can

genuinely move the needle while embracing the culture that makes us who we are.

One benefit of having Michael in the mix is that he can provide a global perspective, and he would be important

for explaining the case outside the US if we moved forward.

Just let me know when and how you want to speak next.
Best,

Steve
