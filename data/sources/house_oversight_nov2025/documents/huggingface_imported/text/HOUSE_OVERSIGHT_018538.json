  "text": "experience is primarily with dungeons owned by \"lifestyle\" BDSMers -- \"lifestyle\" being\na clumsy word that attempts to denote those of us who are motivated to do BDSM for\nreasons other than money. While there is some overlap between \"lifestyle\" BDSM and\nprofessional BDSM, the overlap can be surprisingly rare, and professional BDSM is often\nbanned at lifestyle BDSM parties. Lifestyle dungeons are often non-profit organizations,\nand often function more like community centers than moneymaking venues. I understand\nthat some professional dungeons have a \"no sex\" rule out of a desire to protect the\nboundaries of dominatrixes who work there, who may not wish to be asked to engage in\nSex.)\n\nThere are also plenty of cultural groups who do things that look suspiciously like\nBDSM... who insist that they have nothing to do with BDSM. For example, I've heard of\nspanking clubs whose members get really mad if you dare bring BDSM up in their\npresence.\n\nAnd then there's groups like Taken In Hand, a quasi-conservative organization. Actual\ntestimonial from the Taken In Hand site:\n\nThere are lots of websites for people in the BDSM, D/s, DD (domestic discipline) and\nspanking communities. There are websites for people who belong to religions that\nadvocate male-head-of-household marriage. There are even websites for Christians who\nare interested in BDSM. But there are very few websites for people who are interested in\nmale-led intimate relationships but who are not interested in all that the above\ncommunities associate with this kind of relationship (jargon, clothes, etc.) Some of us\ndon't even like thinking of this as a lifestyle.\n\nWell, my friend, you know what... you can refuse to call yourself BDSM all you want,\nand you can reject our \"jargon\" all you want, and you can \"dislike\" thinking of this\n\"lifestyle\" until the end of time... and you have every right to insist that we have nothing\nto do with you. But when your site has posts that include comments like \"When my\nhusband behaves in a dominant manner I basically swoon,\" or have titles like \"Don't\nforget your whip,\" well... I'm just saying.\n\nAlso, since you mention rejecting BDSM \"clothes\"? I'll just say that I can be an\nastoundingly badass domme in a t-shirt. And I have done so. Multiple times.\n\nPersonally, I am particularly frustrated by the stigmatizing idea that BDSM has nothing\nto do with love. Sometimes I encounter this idea that BDSM has to be separated from sex\nbecause BDSM has nothing to do with sex, whereas sex supposedly \"should\" be about\nlove. The truth is that both BDSM and sex are very different for different people,\nemotions-wise. Although many people experiment with \"casual BDSM,\" the same way\nmany people experiment with \"casual sex,\" a stereotype that BDSMers cannot find love\nin the act is wrong and absurd.\n\nSo yeah. Nowadays, many of these \"BDSM versus sex\" reactions strike me as being born\nout of pure, irrational stigma. As Dr. Klein noted, these reactions are usually born of the\nterrible human urge to exclude: to find ways to differentiate ourselves from \"those\npeople.\" Humans apparently love to think things like: \"I'm not like those people. It\ndoesn't matter if I, for example, write extensive rape fantasy fiction! That couldn't\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018538",
