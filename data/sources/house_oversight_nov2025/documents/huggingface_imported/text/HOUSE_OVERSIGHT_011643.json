  "text": "reasonable chance of success, he would approve it. But otherwise, we could not\nlet dozens of hostages be murdered if by talking, even deal-making, we could\nhave saved them. He turned to Dan and asked whether there indeed was a\nmilitary option with a reasonable prospect of getting the hostages out. Dan said\nyes. Rabin turned to me next. I agreed: we had a plan, and we felt we could\nmake it work. Motta was a bit more hesitant. He suggested we couldn’t know\nfor sure until we’d finished testing key parts of the operation. But for Rabin, it\nseemed to me Dan’s was the key voice. So he told us that he was approving it.\nIn principle.\n\nHe said he still needed answers to two questions. The first was whether it\nwas physically possible to cross from the new terminal area, where we’d be\nlanding, to the old terminal buidling. He was right to press us. If a retaining wall\nor a drainage trench had been added druing the modernization work on the\nairport, any element of surprise could be lost. Rabin’s second condition was that\nwe find a way to make absolutely sure, by the time the first Hercules landed,\nthat the hostages were still in the old terminal building. I knew why that\ntroubled him, from a remark I’d heard him make a few years earlier when\ndescribing an American hostage-rescue raid behind enemy lines in North\nVietnam. That operation went exactly as planned. Except that the POWs had\nbeen moved.\n\nI drove to see Yoni and Mookie at the sayeret base. We spent most of the\nmeeting on the opening few minutes of the operation: the rolling out of the\nvehicles, the drive to the old terminal, and how to handle the possibility that we\nmight meet Ugandan resistance. Mookie remained adamant about the\nUgandans, from his time training them a few years earlier. Even if we did run\ninto a group of Amin’s troops, even if they were armed, even if they were\npointing their guns at us, even if they shout at us to stop, they “wouldn’t dare\nopen fire on a Mercedes.” I trusted his experience. I kept emphasizing that we\nhad to go in with the mindset of not engaging Ugandan troops unless there was\nno choice. If we did need to do so, we would use only small, silenced Berettas —\nsince I’d made sure the unit trained on the Berettas after Sabena.\n\nI also raised another critical condition for success. “There will definitely be\nan armed presence in the control tower,” I said. We needed to designate a\nspecial unit whose sole job would be to train machine guns, rifles and grenade-\nlaunchers on the tower as soon as we got off the Hercules. “The moment that we\nlose the element of surprise, they open fire.”\n\n172\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011643",
