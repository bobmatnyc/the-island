  "text": "14\n\nSyrian refugees are already sheltering inside Turkey, as are numerous\nSyrian army defectors. Possibly anticipating Syrian retaliation, the\nnewspaper Hiirriyet reported that President Abdullah Giil recently\nwarned Assad would pay a heavy price for stirring up trouble in\nTurkey's Kurdish south-east.\n\nFears that a Syrian meltdown could seriously destabilise the wider\nneighbourhood are also driving Turkey's hardening response. Such a\nscenario could affect Iraq, where security concerns are rising as the\nUS withdrawal nears completion, and even Iran, a close Assad ally.\nFor its part, the Syrian regime has pressing reasons to fear Ankara's\nanimosity, as Gékhan Bacik pointed out in Today's Zaman. Unlike\nmany Muslim countries, Turkey identifies strongly with Europe, the\nUS and Nato. And in the past decade, Erdogan's Justice and\nDevelopment party has made its brand of moderate Islamist politics\nacceptable to previously blinkered western eyes.\n\nIn other words, Turkey, with its majority Sunni Muslim population,\nfurnishes a role model for the disenfranchised Sunni majority in Syria\n(and other Arab spring countries). Not only is Ankara encouraging\nrevolution in Damascus, it is also living proof that Assad's politics of\nfear are outdated, that Syrians have before them a workable\nalternative paradigm, and that, after the revolution, the country's\nsecular, Islamist and other sectarian traditions could fairly hope to co-\nexist peacefully, Turkish-style.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031954",
