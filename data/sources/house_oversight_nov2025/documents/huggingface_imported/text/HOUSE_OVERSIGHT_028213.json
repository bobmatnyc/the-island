I will simply not do it.”\n\nI tried to keep my voice steady when I replied. I explained that the issues we\nwere addressing went to the heart of Israel’s interests, its future security, its\nidentity and definition as a nation. I had a responsibility to tread carefully. Then,\nmy voice rising too, I came back to what I felt was the real problem. Arafat and his\nnegotiators had been sitting and waiting for me and my team, and probably Clinton\nas well, to deliver more and more concessions with no sign that they were willing\nto move on anything. “I find that outrageous,” I said. I did not expect Arafat to\nrespond with equal concessions. After all, Israel had most of the tangible assets.\n“But I did expect him at least to take a small step once we had taken ten. We have\nnot seen even this. This is the kind of behavior parents would not tolerate in their\nown children! We don’t expect Arafat to accept this, but I do expect him to present\na counter-position.”\n\nClinton remained adamant he couldn’t go to Arafat with a retreat from our\nearlier ideas. “My negotiating team moved beyond my red lines,” I told him. The\novernight talks were supposed to be non-binding and assumed that both sides\nwould make a genuine attempt to get an agreement. “I can’t see any change in\nArafat’s pattern. We take all the risks.” I said I doubted that Arafat expected to\nhear that we had decided to “give him Jerusalem.” In any case, the Israeli public\nhadn’t given me a mandate to do that. But I would still move in Arafat’s direction,\nif and when I got any sign he was willing to do the same.\n\nThe President’s anger eased. He suggested he caucus with his negotiators and\nfigure out what to do next. I felt bad about what had happened: not about the list of\nquestions, or my insistence that we could not offer major concessions with no sign\nof reciprocity. But I did regret that it had left the Americans so frustrated, and\nClinton so angry. He had invested not just huge amounts of time and brainpower,\nbut political capital, in the search for peace.\n\nHe phoned me at about 3:30 in the morning and asked me to come back. This\ntime, I went alone. We sat on the terrace of Aspen. He said again he couldn’t go to\nArafat with the list we’d drawn up. But having met with his negotiators, he\nsuggested they draft a more forthcoming list of their own — consistent with what\nShlomo and Gili had proposed. I agreed, as long as they kept in mind that it had to\nbe something I could ultimately live with, and that it be presented to Arafat as an\n\n365\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028213",
