They're all going to say no, there wasn't.\n\nWe'll have a trial on that and hear th vidence. But the\n\ncompatibility of interests is, that team is against\n\nMs. Giuffre. Those co-conspirators are all working together to\n\ntry to undercut the credibility of Ms. Giuffre. And of course\n\nthey're all hoping that she will lose this trial, which they\n\nwill then celebrate as a victory. Of course if Ms. Giuffre\n\nwins the trial, they will all suffer a defeat because her\n\ncredibility in making these allegations will have been\n\nestablished.\n\nThe final factor LiButti directs you to consider is\n\nthe role in the underlying aspects of the litigation, and\nagain, it's hard to imagine. I won't say they are the most\n\nimportant members of the conspiracy. Epstein is the most\n\nimportant member of the conspiracy, but the next most\n\nimportant, after Maxwell, who's the number two position, the\n\nnext most important conspirator is Kellen and Marcinkova. I've\nused the expression before, it's kind of playing Hamlet without\n\nthe ghost. We're going to be talking about a conspiracy\n\nwithout the conspirators in the case. We are trying to bring\n\nthe conspirators here in front of the jury so that they can\nhear what the conspirators have to say when asked questions\nabout what they were doing to Ms. Giuffre and what they were\n\ndoing to similarly situated young girls.\n\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT REPORTERS, P.C.\n(212) 805-0300\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011444",
