Damages €757.14, 57.27\n\nIn New York, a plaintiff may establish\nnegligent infliction of emotional distress\nunder the bystander or direct duty theory.\n\n87. Damages €°57.27\n\nUnder the bystander theory for prov-\ning negligent infliction of emotional dis-\ntress under New York law, a defendant’s\nconduct is negligent as creating an unrea-\nsonable risk of bodily harm to a plaintiff,\nand such conduct is a substantial factor in\nbringing about injuries to the plaintiff in\nconsequence of shock or fright resulting\nfrom his or her contemporaneous observa-\ntion of serious physical injury or death\ninflicted by the defendant’s conduct on a\nmember of the plaintiff's immediate family\nin his or her presence.\n\n88. Damages €-57.14\n\nUnder the direct duty theory for\nproving negligent infliction of emotional\ndistress under New York law, a plaintiff\nsuffers emotional distress caused by defen-\ndant’s breach of a duty which unreason-\nably endangered the plaintiff's own physi-\ncal safety.\n\n89. Negligence ¢=202\n\nTo establish a claim for negligence\nunder New York law, a plaintiff must show\nthat the defendant owed the plaintiff a\ncognizable duty of care, that the defendant\nbreached that duty, and that the plaintiff\nsuffered damages as a proximate cause of\nthat breach.\n\n90. Negligence <=210\n\nThe most basic element of a negli-\ngence claim under New York law is the\nexistence of a duty owed to plaintiffs by\ndefendants.\n\n91. Banks and Banking <-100\n\nUnder New York negligence law,\nbanks do not owe non-customers a duty to\nprotect them from the intentional torts of\ntheir customers.\n\n92. Damages €757.18\n\nNegligence <=210\n\nSurvivors of victims of September 11,\n2001 attacks failed to state causes of action\nin complaint against alleged supporters of\nterrorists for negligence and negligent in-\nfliction of emotional distress, inasmuch as\nthey failed to allege or identify duty owed\nto them by defendants.\n\n93. War and National Emergency <=50\n\nIn light of extreme nature of charge of\nterrorism, fairness required extra-careful\nscrutiny of allegations by survivors of vic-\ntims of September 11, 2001 attacks as to\nany particular defendant, to ensure that\nhe, or it, had fair notice of claims, includ-\ning claims under Antiterrorism Act (ATA).\n18 U.S.C.A. § 2331 et seq.\n\n94. Banks and Banking ¢=226\n\nAllegations in complaint by survivors\nof victims of September 11, 2001 attacks,\nthat Saudi Arabian bank aided and abetted\nterrorists by donating to charities and act-\ning as bank for charities, failed to state\ncause of action under Antiterrorism Act\n(ATA) against bank, in that survivors of-\nfered no facts to support conclusion that\nbank knew of charities’ alleged support for\nterrorism, and failed to allege relationship\nbetween Hamas, with which bank allegedly\nhad ties, and September 11 terrorists. 18\nU.S.C.A. § 2331 et seq.\n\n95. Conspiracy 1.1\n\nTorts 21\n\nUnder New York law, concerted ac-\ntion liability, pursuant to a conspiracy or\naiding and abetting theory, requires gener-\nal knowledge of the primary actor’s con-\nduct.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017842",
