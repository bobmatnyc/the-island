  "text": "124\n\nIn view of such past successes of the Russian intelligence services, it cannot be precluded that\nthere was another person in the NSA working with Snowden who used an enthusiastic as cover to\nprevent any light from falling on his own surreptitious spying. While it may seem extremely\nunlikely that Snowden had such assistance, the alternative scenario, that Snowden broke into the\nsealed compartments and made off with the documents without any assistance, seems equally\nunlikely.\n\nEven if Snowden had been, as he claims, a pure idealist seeking to right a perceived wrong, it\n\ndoes exclude the possibility of his becoming entangled in the plots of others. Intelligence services\nmake it their business to bring about such witting or unwitting entanglements.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020276",
