  "text": "14\n\nthe whole of Syria is demanding change. The largest cities of Aleppo\nand Damascus remain relatively calm, while opinion in western\ncapitals is led by reports generated via opposition movements, often\nusing social media of questionable reliability. The army has\ncommitted many atrocities but hundreds of its members appear to\nhave been killed, too. In the absence of international media, it is\ndebatable whether the protesters are altogether peaceful.\n\nAlready, calls for military intervention are being made by Syrian\nopposition activists in meetings at the White House and US state\ndepartment. Yet such movements have led us astray before, as when\npoliticians such as Ahmed Chalabi misled the US about realities in\nIraq. In truth, Mr Assad’s regime is much less likely to fall than that\nof Muammer Gaddafi: there have been no high-profile political or\nmilitary defections, while Mr Assad remains relatively popular\namong senior military commanders, Syrian mosque clerics, the\nmiddle classes and business leaders.\n\nThis brings us back to the “then what” question. The numbers being\nkilled now will wither in comparison with a possible future civil war,\nif an increasingly sectarian Syria splinters between the ruling\nAlawites, the elite and urban Christians, the majority Sunnis, the\nKurds, Druze and others. There is no civil society to engineer a\npeaceful transition, while Syria could plausibly become another\nLebanon, acting as a proxy battleground for regional powers.\n\nThis risk partly explains why Syria’s ally Turkey has exerted such\neffort to rein in the slaughter, and why Saudi Arabia, Russia and\nChina have not joined America’s lead. They all want to give Mr\nAssad more time — because they recognise the thin chance of getting\nrid of him, and because they fear the violence that would follow if he\ndid fall.\n\nAlmost 90 per cent of Syria’s crude oil exports go to European\ncountries. Almost $3bn of its annual trade is conducted with Turkey.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031926",
