Products issued in Oct-16\n(US$3.1bn) and Nov-2016 (USS3.4bn) have knocked out recently and rolled into\nnew products. However, the legacy HSCEl-linked products issued in May-15 were\nstruck at a very high HSCEI spot level and were not able to knock-out this month.\nWe think issuance may pick up in July and August as ~US$4.0bn of legacy products\nmay knock-out in Jul-17 with an average HSCEI knock-out level of 9665 (Chart 43).\n\ne — Issuance in KOSPI2-linked products (up from US$840mn to US$846mn) remained\nsteady in May-17; HSI-linked products fell 66% from US$360mn to US$120mn as\ninvestors prefered HSCEl-linked products (which only fell from USS760mn to\nUSS700mpn).\n\ne  §X5E-linked (US$1.0bn)}, KOSPI2-linked (US$846mn), HSCEl-linked (US$700mn),\nand SPX-linked products (US$550mn) accounted for 86% of the May-17 issuance.\nWe estimate that structured product issuers are currently long US$10mn of KOSPI2\nvega and USS89mn HSCEI vega respectively. The majority of the US$89mn HSCE|\noutstanding vega came from the US$14bn of HSCEI-linked legacy products issued\nbetween Apr-15 and Jul-15 that have not knocked-out.\n\ndeg oes Bankof America\n20 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 06 June 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023594",
