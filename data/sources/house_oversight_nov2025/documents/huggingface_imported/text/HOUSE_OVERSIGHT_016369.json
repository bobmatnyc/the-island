  "text": "AI’s impact on existential questions of the self and our future interaction with nonhuman\nentities. Few, though, have taken the technologies and innovations of AI as the\nunderlying materials of their work and sculpted them to their own vision. An exception\nis the artist Ian Cheng, who has gone as far as to construct entire worlds of artificial\nbeings with varying degrees of sentience and intelligence. He refers to these worlds as\nLive Simulations. His Emissaries trilogy (2015-2017) is set in a fictional postapocalyptic\nworld of flora and fauna, in which AI-driven animals and creatures explore the landscape\nand interact with each other. Cheng uses advanced graphics but has them programmed\nwith a lot of glitches and imperfections, which imparts a futuristic and anachronistic\natmosphere at the same time. Through his trilogy, which charts a history of\nconsciousness, he asks the question “What is a simulation?”\n\nWhile the majority of artistic works that utilize recent developments in AI\nspecifically draw from the field of machine learning, Cheng’s Live Simulations take a\nseparate route. The protagonists and plot lines that are interlaced in each episodic\nsimulation of Emissaries use the complex logic systems and rules of AI. What is\nprofound about his continually evolving scenes is that complexity arises not through the\ndesire/actions of any single actor or artificial godhead but instead through their\nconstellation, collision, and constant evolution in symbiosis with one another. This gives\nrise to unexpected outcomes and unending, unknowable situations—you can never\nexperience the exact same moment in successive viewings of his work.\n\nCheng had a discussion at the Serpentine Marathon “GUEST, GHOST, HOST:\nMACHINE!” with the programmer Richard Evans, who recently designed Versu, an AI-\nbased platform for interactive storytelling games. Evans’ work emphasizes the social\ninteraction of the games’ characters, who react in a spectrum of possible behaviors to the\nchoices made by the human players. In their conversation, Evans said that a starting\npoint for the project was that most earlier simulation video games, such as The Sims, did\nnot sufficiently take into account the importance of social practices. Simulated\nprotagonists in games would often act in ways that did not correspond well with real\nhuman behavior. Knowledge of social practices limits the possibilities of action but is\nnecessary to understand the meaning of our actions—which is what interests Cheng for\nhis own simulations. The more parameters of actions in certain circumstances are\ndetermined in a computer simulation, the more interesting it is for Cheng to experiment\nwith individual and specific changes. He told Evans, “I gather that if we had AI with\nmore ability to respond to social contexts, tweaking one thing, you would get something\nquite artistic and beautiful.”\n\nCheng also sees the work of programmers and AI simulations as creating new and\nsophisticated tools for experimenting with the parameters of our daily social practices. In\nthis way, the involvement of artists in AI will lead to new kinds of open experiments in\nArt. Such possibilities are—like increased AI capabilities in general—still in the future.\nRecognizing that this is an experimental technology in its infancy, very far from\napocalyptic visions of a superintelligent AI takeover, Cheng fills his simulations with\nprosaic avatars such as strange microbial globules, dogs, and the undead.\n\nDiscussions like these, between artists and engineers, of course are not totally\nnew. In the 1960s, the engineer Billy Kliiver brought artists together with engineers in a\nseries of events, and in 1967 he founded the Experiments in Art and Technology program\nwith Robert Rauschenberg and others.
