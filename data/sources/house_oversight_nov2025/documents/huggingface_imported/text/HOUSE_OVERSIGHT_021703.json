This was unconventional, but Virginia had no suspicions. Presumably,\nshe thought, this was how the wealthy conducted their business.\n\nEpstein elicited the information that Virginia had been a runaway, and was no longer a virgin.\n\nVirginia was then told to start massaging Epstein, under the instructions of the woman who had shown\nher in. The massage quickly developed into a sexual encounter.\n\nVirginia was uncomfortable, but reluctant to deny such important people. ‘My face was red with\nembarrassment,’ she says. ‘But | felt under immense pressure to please them.\n\nThe whole time it was going on, they were promising me the world, that I'd travel with Jeffrey on his\nprivate jet and have a well-paid profession.’ Afterwards, she was given two $100 bills and told to return\nthe next day.\n\nThat was the beginning of the four years she spent with Epstein.\n\nFor three of those years, she was under Florida’s age of consent, which is 18.\n\nTroubled teenager: Virginia on the billionaire's Zorro ranch in New Mexico in 2001\n\nVirginia was fascinated by his life story: the son of a humble New York City parks worker, he was a\nteacher before becoming a Wall Street broker and friends with the upper echelons of the political,\nfinancial and academic establishment.\n\nAs a confused teenager, Virginia easily fell into the practice of sexually gratifying him for money.\n\nhttp://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1361039/Prince-Andrew-girl-17-sex-offender-frie... 3/16/2011\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021703",
