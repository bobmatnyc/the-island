Courts\nare not obligated to subject a foreign de-\nfendant to discovery, however, where the\nallegations of jurisdictional facts, con-\nstrued in plaintiffs’ favor, fail to state a\nbasis for the exercise of jurisdiction or\nwhere discovery would not uncover suffi-\ncient facts to sustain jurisdiction. Jd. (cit-\ning Jazini, 148 F.3d at 183-85 (granting\nmotion to dismiss and denying jurisdiction-\nal discovery where complaint was de-\nscribed as “sparse” and “conclusory”)); see\nalso Cornell v. Assicurazioni Generali\nS.p.A., Consolidated, Nos. 97 Civ. 2262, 98\nCiv. 9186(MBM), 2000 WL 284222, at *2\n(S.D.N.Y. Mar. 16, 2000) (granting motion\nto dismiss and denying request for juris-\ndictional discovery where the complaint\nstated, without any supporting facts, that\nthe defendant “participates in a ‘multina-\ntional insurance arrangement’ present in\nthe State of New York”); Im re Ski Train\nFire in Kaprun, Austria, 230 F.Supp.2d at\n410-413 (granting motion to dismiss and\ndenying jurisdictional discovery where\ncomplaint only contained conclusory alle-\ngations).\n\nD. Application of Plaintiffs’ Theo-\nries to Moving Defendants\n\n1. Prince Sultan\n\nThe Court outlined the allegations\nagainst Prince Sultan in Part I.B.1. With\nrespect to Prince Sultan’s contacts with\nthe United States, Plaintiffs allege that\n“Saudi Royal family members own sub-\nstantial assets in the United States of\nAmerica, and do substantial business in\nthe United States of America, the profits\nof which in part, are used to fund interna-\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\ntional terrorist acts, including those which\nled to the murderous attacks of September\n11, 2001.” See Ashton Complaint 1296.\nThere is no indication of whether these\nunspecified members of the Royal family\ninclude Prince Sultan. Most Plaintiffs also\nclaim Prince Sultan is the ex-officio Chair-\nman of the Board of Saudi Arabia Airlines,\n“which does business in the United States\nand internationally.” Burnett Complaint\n1340; Ashton Complaint 1253; Barrera\nComplaint 1255; Salvo Complaint 1245;\nTremsky Complaint 1180. The Federal\nPlaintiffs do not make a similar allegation.\n\n[57] To the extent these allegations are\nan attempt to establish general jurisdiction\nover Prince Sultan, they are insufficient.\nSee In ve Baan Co. Sec. Litig, 245\nF.Supp.2d 117, 180 (D.D.C.2003) (refusing\nto hold that control status in foreign corpo-\nration with United States office is suffi-\ncient for personal jurisdiction over individ-\nual); Cornell, 2000 WL 284222, at *2\n(granting motion to dismiss where com-\nplaint contained one conclusory statement\nregarding jurisdiction); Family Internet,\nInc. v. Cybernex, Inc, No. 98 Civ.\n06377RWS), 1999 WL 796177, at *4\n(S.D.N.Y. Oct. 6, 1999) (holding that per-\nsonal jurisdiction must be individually es-\ntablished over corporate officers even\nwhen the court has personal jurisdiction\nover the corporation itself).\n\n[58] Proceeding under the purposefully\ndirected activities theory of personal juris-\ndiction, Plaintiffs argue that Prince Sultan\nknew or should have known the organiza-\ntions to which he donated were funneling\nmoney to al Qaeda and that al Qaeda’s\nprimary target was the United States.\nConsol. Plaintiffs’ Opp. at 23. Prince Sul-\ntan argues that his alleged actions cannot\nsatisfy the minimum contacts requirement\nsince the Second Circuit’s recent descrip-\ntion of Calder requires “primary partici-\npa[tion] in intentional wrongdoing.” See\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017877",
