This latter group reminds me of the ancient Greek\nGods: they are very powerful, but sometimes flawed, as their\ninterventions in the world did not always work as planned.\nWe are getting closer to the Twilight of the Gods, a time when\nthey are either running out of ammunition, or the ability to use\nit without causing even more problems. If so, the private\nsector will have to recover on its own. The consequence of\nthese cross-currents: we invest in equities, but hold 10%-15%\nless than what we normally would at this point of the business\ncycle, and are positioning for a single-digit year on equities.\n\nPROFITS\n\nHigh Yield, Core Bonds,\nLeveraged 8%\n\nInflation, 2%\n\nCash, 3%\n\nLoans, ;\nStructured Public equity\nCredit, 10% 36%\nEmerging JPMUS\nMarket FX, 5% Balanced\nDiversified Model Portfolio\nHedge Funds,\n\n6%\nRealEstate, Single Strategy\n3% Hard Assets, Hedge Funds\n4% 18%\nSource: J.P. Morgan Private Bank, as of July 2011.\nThese portfolios may notbe suitable for allinvestors & are shown for\nillustrative purposes only\n\nThe primary (and perhaps sole) justification for carrying the levels of risk shown above relates to corporate profits. As\nshown below, profit margins have reached levels not seen in decades. The challenge, which we have discussed many times\nbefore: what is driving these margins’? One useful way to deconstruct profits is to measure them from peak to peak, and\nanalyze what changed. As shown in the first chart, S&P 500 profit margins increased by ~1.3% from 2000 to 2007. There are a\nlot of moving parts in the margin equation, but as shown in the second chart, reductions in wages and benefits explain the\nmajority of the net improvement in margins. This trend has continued; as we have shown several times over the last two\nyears, US labor compensation is now at a 50-year low relative to both company sales and US GDP (see EoTM April 26, 2011).\n\nS&P 500 pre-tax margins\nExcluding financials, large-cap proxy used before1976\n16%\n15%\n14%\n13%\n12%\n11%\n10%\n9%\n8%\n1%\n6%\n1965 1970 1975 1980 1985 1990 1995 2000 2005 2010\n\nSource: Corporate reports, Empirical Research Partners.

Why is US labor compensation so low? The lingering excess labor supply from the recession is one reason, but the 2\nbillion people in Asia joining the global labor force over the last two decades is another. As shown on next page, EM wages for\nproduction workers remain well below US levels*. Another factor helping profit margins: increased US imports of intermediate\ngoods from Asia. As shown in the accompanying chart, imports from Asia have been rising, and over the same time frame,\n\nAsian import prices only increased at around 1% per year.\n\nWe use these portfolios to manage assets for clients who give us discretion over their funds, and to provide recommendations to those who\ndon’t. This is one of several model portfolios we manage globally. They differ by jurisdiction, risk tolerance, tax treatment, eligibility to\npurchase vehicles designated for qualified purchasers, and other factors.\n\n* Empirical Research Partners does more work on corporate profits than anyone else we’ve seen. This section draws on research that Mike\nGoldstein at Empirical shared with us at a recent investment committee meeting.\n\n> A recent study from Boston Consulting Group maintains that the gap between China and the US will close in 5 years. BCG believes that\nwith Chinese wages growing at 15%-20% per year, US wages growing at 3% per year, higher productivity in the US and rising shipping and\ninventory costs, the China advantage will disappear within the decade. Some of these assumptions seem aggressive to apply in perpetuity.\n\n1\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030808",
