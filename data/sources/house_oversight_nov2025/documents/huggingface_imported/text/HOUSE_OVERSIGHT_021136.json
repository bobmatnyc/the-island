  "text": "24 MICHAEL WOLFE\n\nThat afternoon, a bipartisan Congress with surprising ease had passed the\n$1.3 trillion 2018 appropriations bill. “McConnell, Ryan, Schumer, and\nPelosi,” said Bannon about the Republican and Democratic congressional\nleadership, “in their singular moment of bipartisan magnanimity, put one\nover on Trump.”\n\nThis legislative milestone was a result of Trump's disengagement and\neverybody else's attentive efforts. Most presidents are eager to get down into\nthe weeds of the budget process. Trump took little or no interest. Hence the\nRepublican and Democratic leadership—here supported by the budget\nand legislative teams in the White House—were able to pass an enormous\nspending bill that failed to fund Trumps must-must item, the holy grail\nWall, that prospective two-thousand-mile monument meant to run the\nentire length of the border between the United States and Mexico. Instead,\nthe bill provided only $1.6 billion for border security. The current bill was in\neffect the same budget bill that had been pushed forward at the end of the\nprevious September, when the Wall had once again not been funded. In the\nfall, Trump had agreed to have the Republican-controlled Congiess vote to\nextend the September budget bill. The next time it came up, the Wall would\nbe funded or, he threatened, the government would be shut down.\n\nEven the hardest-core Trumpers in Congress seemed content not to\nhave to die on the actual battlefield of funding the Wall, since that would\nmean embracing or at least enduring an always politically risky shutdown.\nTrump, too, in his way, seemed to understand that the Wall was more\nmyth than reality, more slogan than actual plan. The Wall was ever for\nanother day.\n\nOn the other hand, it was unclear what the president understood.\n“We've gotten the budget,” he privately told his son-in-law at the end of\nthe March budget negotiations. “We've gotten the Wall, totally.”\n\nOF\n\nOn Wednesday, March 21, the day before the final vote, Paul Ryan, the\nSpeaker of the House, had come to the White House to receive the presi-\ndent's blessings on the budget bill.\n\n“Got $1.6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forth-\ncoming,’ the president shortly tweeted.\n\nSIEGE 25\n\nThe White House had originally asked for $25 billion for the Wall,\nalthough high-end estimates of the Wall’s ultimate cost came in at $70\nbillion. Even then, the $1.6 billion in the appropriations bill was not so\nmuch for the Wall as for better security measures.\n\nAs the final vote neared, a gentlemen's agreement appeared to have\nbeen reached, one that extended to every corner of the government—\nwith, it even seemed, Trump's own tacit support, or at least his conve-\nnient distraction. The understanding was straightforward: whatever their\nstripe, members of Congress would not blow up the appropriations pro-\ncess for the Wall.\n\nThere were, too, Republicans like Ryan—with the backing of Repub-\nlican donors such as Paul Singer and Charles Koch—who were eager to\nwalk back, by whatever increment possible, Trump's hard-line immigra-\ntion policies and rhetoric. Ryan and others had devised a simple method\nfor accomplishing this kind of objective: you agreed with him and then\nignored him. There was happy talk, which Trump bathed in, followed by\npractical steps, which bored him.\n\nThat Wednesday, Trump made a series of calls to praise everyone’s\nwork on the bill. The next morning, Ryan, in a televised news conference\nto seal the deal, said, “The president supports this bill, there's no two ways\nabout it.”\n\nHere were the twin realities. The Wall was the most concrete manifesta-\ntion of Trumpian policy, attitude, belief, and personality. At the same time,\nthe Wall forced every Republican politician to come to terms with his or\nher own common sense, fiscal prudence, and political flexibility.\n\nIt was not just the expense and impracticality of the Wall, it was hav-\ning to engage in a battle for it. A government shutdown would mean a\nhigh-stakes face-off between the Trump world and the non-Trump world\nShould this come to pass, it would potentially be as dramatic a moment as\nany that had occurred since the election of 2016.\n\nIf the Democrats wanted to harden the partisan division and were\neager to find yet another example—perhaps the mother of all exam-\nples—of Trump at his most extreme, a shutdown over the Wall woulc\nhand them one. If the Republicans wanted to shift the focus from a full\nbarbarian Trump to, say, the tax bill the Congress had recently passed\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021136",
