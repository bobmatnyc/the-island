  "text": "was certainly preaching to the converted. The truth is, Epstein does know a lot about a lot of things. Just a few\nmoments in his company and you know this to be true.\n\nWhen I saw pictures of Prince Andrew walking in Central Park with Jeffrey, my immediate thought was that\n“Andy”’—as Jeffrey calls him—is probably asking for help with his role as British trade envoy, or whatever his\nstrange title is. Because if one thing’s for sure: When it comes to international business, Jeffrey knows what\nhe’s talking about far more than “Andy” does. Which is why Leon Black, Mort Zuckerman and a few other\nfinanciers hang out with him.\n\nAnd Ghislaine?\nFull disclosure: I like her. Most people in New York do. It’s almost impossible not to.\n\nShe is always the most interesting, the most vivacious, the most unusual person in any room. I’ve spent hours\ntalking to her about the third world at a bar until 2am. She is as passionate as she is knowledgeable. She is\ncurious. She has spent weeks at the bottom of the ocean, literally going deeper than anyone else. She has sent\nme a DVD of the fish there. Her rolodex would blow away almost anyone else’s I can think of—probably even\nRupert Murdochs’. She is very well-read and can talk about most things for hours. She is passionate about Bill\nClinton with whom she is close friends.\n\nYet, touchingly, when she had to give a speech at the 40th birthday party of her best friend, Ariadne Calvo-\nPlatero, (known fondly to her close friends as “the Tennis Goddess”) Ghislaine shook a little with nerves. When\nit comes down to things she really cares about—and Ariadne is one of them—Ghislaine shows her\nvulnerability.\n\nAnd that vulnerability is key to understanding her friendship with Jeffrey.\n\n“He saved her,” I remember a close friend of mine telling me. “When her father died, she was a wreck;\ninconsolable. And then Jeffrey took her in. She’s never forgotten that—and never will.”\n\nIn many ways, the socially awkward Epstein with his big house, plane, island and ranch was the perfect\nreplacement for her father, the late Robert Maxwell, newspaper tycoon and criminal. Sure, Jeffrey had his\nsexual pecadillos, but then Ghislaine’s father was not without his oddities. After all, 1t was he who died leaving\na massive “black hole” he’d fraudulently created. To Ghislaine, Jeffrey’s habits may not have seemed that\nstrange.\n\nIn fact, she probably figured, rather like I have, after years of writing about he very rich, that most successful\npeople in the end either have some weird habit (the late Bruce Wasserstein had the weight issues, the girl issues,\nand moved countries to avoid paying tax), or they break the law (Sam Waksal, Martha Stewart.) You don’t\ntend to get to the top by being the world’s most balanced human being. Even the folksy Warren Buffett didn’t\nquite manage a normal life—whatever that is. He had a second “wife” for many years whose existence he has\nbeen open about.\n\nSo what to make of the current fuss over Ghislaine? I haven’t spoken to her or to Jeffrey, but I suspect that her\nloyalty to friends like Bill Clinton will keep her in good stead, in the end, she’Il be out and about as always.\nLook at Waksal and Stewart. No one sees them and thinks: criminal. Au contraire. In this city, money makes up\nfor all sorts of blemishes.\n\n3s 2fe 2s fe 2s 2 24s ois 2fe 2h oye fs 2s 2c ois 24s of oye ofs 2s 2s ois 2fe ois 2fe ois of ofc ois 24s ois fe of 2s 2c ois 2fe ois 2fe fs fe 2s ois 2fe ois 2fe 2s fe 2s ois ofc ois 2s ois 2s 2c ok 2k ok\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030529",
