  "text": "want to give you a blow job so much.”\n\nAnd Trump says, “Yeah, but what’s in\nit for me?”\n(laughter)\n\nThere’s an old saying in psychology.\nIn order to deceive people, you have\nto deceive yourself. Here’s the thing:\nTrump has instant belief. He just be-\nlieves whatever he says. With Obama’s\nbirth certificate controversy, he would\nbelieve it, even though he had to know\nit wasn’t true. Then, he said he’d hired\ninvestigators to $0 to Hawaii.\n\nEP: (embarrassed for history) | remem-\nber that.\n\nPK: I think that was a lie, too! I don’t think\nhe ever sent them. Or, if he did\n\nPK: The epitome of it, regarding coverage\nof Trump, was CEO Leslie Moonves, who\nsaid “It may not be good for America, but\nit’s damn good for CBS!”\n\nEP: You know, the week Trump won, to\ndeal with shock, my mind started re-\nmembering things that made me laugh.\nOne of your stories showed up: The one\nwhen you met Bob Dylan and asked for\nhis opinion about the Holocaust.\n\nPK: | was at a radio show. And he was\nwatching in the room. It was me, Abbie\nHoffman, a rabbi, and some others.\nDuring the panel, the Holocaust was\nintegrated into the dialogue. Dylan was\nthere watching, sitting in a dark corner in\n\nternative facts”? It was such a bizarre\noxymoron, he couldn't stop laughing.\nEP: My favorite one of her’s is the Bowling\nGreen Massacre. The Internet was hilari-\nous on that. For the Holocaust, of course,\nit’s “Never Forget”; so, for the Bowling\nGreen Massacre, people were posting\npictures of green bowling balls, with the\nphrase “Never Remember”.\n\nPK: Oh, that’s good. It’s like what I was\nmentioning about optimism. The answer\nis what we saw right after the inaugura-\ntion, with the march and the rallies.\nTrump is essentially the monster we’ve\ncreated. Whereas Frankenstein was\nmade from corpses, Trump was made\nfrom fringe subcultures: First\n\nsend them, and they didn’t find\nany “evidence,” then he lied by\nomission...of facts.\n\nEP: | wonder if these lies are\ngoing to have consequences —\nif impeachment will happen.\nGetting Congress to do it will\nbe nearly impossible.\n\nPE: There’s little hints that\nthe Republicans — their con-\nscience is gettin ‘em. Those are\nmy hopes.\n\nEP: The fear I have is we're going\nto lose this country through this\nmotherfucker. That we're going\nto have a police state — that we\nwon't have a free press. Do you\nthink these are real fears?\n\nPK: Oh, yeah. Well, you know,\na police state has a bad reputa-\n\nel\n\nfrom the white supremacists\n.. Trump was on the radio\nwith some insane conspiracy\ntheorist, and the host said, “My\nlisteners, they really love you.”\nTrump then went to the Evan-\ngelists, ‘cause that was another\nsubculture. He couldn’t think\nof anything, the first time, from\nthe Bible. Next time, though,\nhe brought a Bible with him.\nHe was smart enough to take\nthe cellophane off it.\nEP: | think for the most part,\nyou've always been on the\nright side of history, actions\nyou've taken and _ political/\nmoral positions — everything\nfrom civil rights, to women’s\nrights, to drug freedom. But I\n\ntion. I mean, cops love it!\n\nThe thing is — ever since I\ntook a lot of acid — I have become an\nover-doer of being optimistic. You can\npick your metaphor, but I think Trump’s\na blessing in disguise.\n\nWith these scares, he’s the monster —\nThe Frankenstein — that we’ve created.\nIt’s from the country’s dumbing-down\nof the media. Especially with the com-\nmercials. You know, when they first had\nTV news, they didn’t have commercials.\nEP: I’ve been trying to get more into the\nhabit of watching PBS News Hour. It’s\namazing to have a full hour of commer-\ncial-free news, and not looping news,\nlike CNN. What’s sad is I find I have to\nbuild up the stamina for it. I actually find\nmyself wanting commercial breaks. PBS\nhad less coverage of Trump’s campaign,\ntoo. Probably because there were no ads\nto sell.\n\n‘artoon by Mort Gerberg, from The Realist #50, May 1964.\n\nthe back of the room. When the program\nwas over, he walked up and said to me,\n“You didn’t say much.” And I thought\nthat was funny, because he was such a\nminimalist.\n\nThen I held up my fist, like a micro-\nphone, and asked, “So, what do you think\nabout the Holocaust?” He offered his\nminimalistic reply: “I resent it.”\n\nEP: That’s just too good a joke.\n\nPK: I remember that, more than the radio\npanel, because it had such an essence\nof itself.\n\nEP: That’s the benefit of minimalism,\nright? It’s like these insane Trump tweets.\nIn some way, they’re stronger because\nthey’re just 140 characters.\n\nPK: By the way, did you see Anderson\nCooper laugh for five minutes when\nKellyanne Conway used the phrase “al-\n\ndon’t know how you decided\nto do some of this shit. For\nexample, you ran an abortion referral\nservice inside The Realist. No reward\nbeyond a moral victory.\nPK: Back then, when it was illegal, people\nthought doctors who performed abortions\nshould be arrested and convicted.\nEP: Let’s discuss the development of your\nethics. What’s your internal compass?\nHave you always had these instincts?\nPK: It happens organically. I remember\nwhen LOOK Magazine said about abor-\ntion, “There are no humane doctors ...\nall of them are just in it for the money.”\nAnd I knew of one: Doctor Spencer in\nAshland, Pennsylvania. He had a reputa-\ntion. It turned out, to be, also, that he\nwas a subscriber.\n\nSo, I wrote him a letter, asking for an\ninterview, because I wanted to point out\nthat LOOR’s statement was a lie. And I\n\nWw\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023640",
