  "text": "synergistically to shed new light on the\nhuman mind? In the Fall of 2004, we\nestablished an ongoing network of more\nthan a dozen scholars unbounded by\ndisciplinary precincts, geographical\nborders, or methodological perspectives\nto set aside antagonisms that had grown\nup between science and humanities in\norder to explore this question. These\nNetwork scholars hail from disciplines\nas disparate as psychology, neurology,\ntheology, statistics, philosophy, internal\nmedicine, anthropology, and sociology.\nEach of these scholars was well known\nin their own field and were busy with\nother obligations, but it was the\nopportunity to achieve a deeper, more\ncomprehensive discussion of the human\nmind that made it worth the time and\neffort it required to be part of the\nNetwork.\n\nAlthough various members of the\nNetwork interact on a daily or weekly\nbasis, the entire Network convenes twice\nannually for a four-day retreat to discuss\neach other’s research, to critique each\nother and to learn from one other.\nScientific analyses characterized by\nrigorous experimental designs and data\nanalytic strategies are interlaced with\nrich philosophical, theological, and\nhistorical analyses of the same questions\nabout invisible forces that act on us all.\nThe dialogue between the Network\nscientists and the scholars from the\nhumanities and theology is bidirectional.\nFor instance, the beliefs and behavior\ndescribed in the humanities and theology\nare rich in hypotheses that can now be\ntested empirically, and the measures and\nmethods of the behavioral sciences and\nneurosciences now permit rigorous\ninvestigation of some of these\nhypotheses. Each of the Network\nmembers brings a unique perspective to\nthe study of the human mind, and the\n\nprovocative story of the mind that is\nemerging from the collective efforts of\nthe Network is the subject of this book.\n\nThe Network is unconventional\nin other ways, as well. Traditionally,\nscientists and scholars work together to\nachieve a common understanding and a\nconsensus position. We quickly learned\nthat we did not need to come to a\nconsensus to benefit tremendously from\nthe dialogue on the capacity and\nmotivation for the ubiquitous human\nquest for sociality and spirituality. For\ninstance, there is no consensus within\nthe Network on whether there is a God,\nand we do not seek here to provide the\nfinal word on what science and the\nhumanities each have to say to the other\nabout the human mind. Instead, our\npurpose is to illustrate the possibility and\nimportance of engaging others whose\nviews we may not share in a serious\ndialogue on such topics. Among the\nlessons we as a Network have learned\nare:\n\n1. that some questions about human\nnature and our social and\nspiritual aspirations have been\nasked by humankind for\nthousands of years. Accordingly,\nthere may be more to be gained\nfrom engaging in a collaborative\nprocess of thinking about these\nquestions than from demanding\nsimple and immediate answers.\nWe discuss what we see as\npossible answers to questions\nabout our nature and strivings,\nbut the value in stating these\npositions is to have clear\npositions from which to move\nthinking and research forward.\nThus, our purpose in writing this\nbook is to articulate ideas to be\nshaped and refined, not to\nprovide the final word.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021255",
