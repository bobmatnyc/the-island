There is but one and it is called in federal court \"\"The 302\"\". It\ncould screw the innocent and the unwary.\n\nThe newspapers and Browardbeat.com make clear that the Federal investigations that led to the arrests\nof County Commissioner Josephus Eggleston, former Miramar Commissioner Fitzroy Salesman. and\nSchool Board member Bev Gallagher are just beginning.\n\nThe FBI will be interviewing everyone from County Administrator Bertha Henry to bus divers about\nanything and everything.\n\nThey are looking for scalps.\n\nI suspect that if the average person thought about it, he would assume that when the FBI comes calling,\nlike Joe Friday from DRAGNET, they \"\"want the facts and nothing but the facts.\"\" Equally important\nthey want an accurate record of that interview so they bring a court reporter or at the very least a tape\nrecorder.\n\nThe average person would be wrong.\n\nAgents bring a pencil and pad to take notes. They then prepare a summary of the interview called a\nrao? Rea way\n\nIf you are called as a witness at ‘trial, prior to testifying, you will be given a copy of \"\"Your 302\" to\n- review. It is arecord of what the FBI insists you said at your previous meeting.\n\nIf your interview lasted more than thirty seconds, it is guaranteed you will find numerous discrepancies. °\n- Some of them will be insignificant; some of them could be material.\n\nfite: YE [Decinenna eee rial/Desktop/E...uction/eDocs/eMail/Grant_Smith080178*eMailContent htm (1 of °) [11/6/2010 10:16:54 PM]\n14545\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030945",
