  "text": "social \"calibration\" -- increasing one's capacity to read social situations -- as well as\n\"inner game\" and being attractive by improving oneself will generally be a positive good.\nIndeed, it could be argued that no PUA tactics are inherently abusive, but some are more\nobviously susceptible to being used badly... the same way a sword is more obviously\nsusceptible to evil usage than a table.\n\nPrevious feminist writers have usually preferred to complain about the seduction\ncommunity's misogyny rather than examining the community deeply. I have been more\ninterested to see whether I could understand and make use of the positive PUA theories.\nUnderstanding the \"Darth Vader\" types might be useful, too. There is a percentage of\nPUAs who are non-consensually hurting women, and if we learn how those men do it, we\nmight also figure out how to disarm them.\n\nI must acknowledge that I eventually felt that the community was damaging, poisonous,\nand unhealthy for me -- to the extent that I needed to get out and detox. (PUA detox is a\nrecognized phenomenon even among some PUAs... and former PUAs.) However, there\nare truths within it that are both intriguing and important.\n\nI have never quite erased my fear of having my \"feminist card\" revoked, although it is not\nclear how \"feminists\" -- a fractious group if ever there was one -- could withdraw my\npresence in the movement. There is no Central Standards Bureau for feminists. Perhaps\ninevitably, the feminist reaction to Confessions of a Pickup Artist Chaser was quite\nmixed... although some other feminists appear to agree that there are important and\ninteresting things to learn from PUAs about gender, culture, and feminist consent models.\n\nAn overall lesson here might be that thinkers with a lot in common are increasingly\nisolated from each other through the accelerating Balkanization of detailed, insular,\ninterest-based subcultures. Like the drive towards interdisciplinary research in academia,\nperhaps a kind of interdisciplinary subcultural approach is being developed by those of us\nmore interested in building bridges than burning them.\n\nte ok ok\n\nThis can be found on the Internet at:\n\nhttp://clarissethorn.com/blog/2012/02/27/feminist-sm-lessons-from-the-seduction-\n\ncommunity/\n\nS&M:\n[storytime] The Strange Binary of Dominance and Submission\n\nI wrote this in early 2012, and it was originally published at RoleReboot.org. If I had to\nsummarize my relationship with this gentleman today, then ironically enough, I'd say that\n\"it got complicated and I'm pretty sure it's over now.\" I still like this piece, though.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018673",
