  "text": "Volatility in Asia\nLong HSCEI-SPX volatility spread via corridor variance\n\nGlobal synchronized monetary tightening is positive for EM vol\n\nEmerging markets have been the biggest beneficiaries of the central bank-fueled\nabundance of liquidity. However, we think the tide may be turning as last week, the Fed,\nECB, and BOE all delivered policy announcements with hawkish tones. How far they\nreally go to tighten policy when economic data is weakening still remains unknown.\nHowever, we think the uncertainty surrounding tightening will be more positive for EM\nvolatility than for DM volatility.\n\nChinese banks: Rapid increase in leverage is a big concern\n\nThe HSCEI currently has a 70% weight in the financial sector. Recently, BofAML analyst\nWinnie Wu turned very bearish on the sector as (1) leverage has rapidly increased—debt\nto GDP rose by 18% in 2016 and may go above 300% by 2019, (2) shadow banking has\nbecome too big, too complicated, and too levered to easily regulate—even at the\nhighest quality bank, China Merchants, off-balance sheet wealth management products\n(WMP) have grown to 40% the size of on-balance sheet assets from just 18% two years\nago, and (3) excessive home price inflation—low and middle-income households are late\nto the party and a correction in prices could have a systemic effect as property assets\nhave been used as collateral in WMPs.\n\nSPX: The Fed is now “collaring” the market\n\nSince the global financial crisis the Fed has been well known for providing a put option\nby its willingness to step in during periods of market stress. However, post the Fed\nmeeting last week, it appears the central bank has decided to cap its monetary support\nas some FOMC members seem worried that financial conditions are too loose.\nEffectively, the market is now “collared” (more so for the SPX compared to EM) as the\ndownside is protected by the Fed put (though with a lower strike price) while the upside\nis capped by log-jammed fiscal policy and positioning, where the risk of quant funds\nselling record equity positions meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buying-\nthe-dip.\n\nThe depressed implied China vs. US risks should reverse\n\nWith the steep drop in global risk premium, the HSCEI-SPX 18-month variance swap\nspread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year trading range. Since we believe the\nglobal synchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCE! volatility more than SPX\nvolatility, we recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points,\na 3 vol point discount to vanilla variance spreads. Investors will be exposed to the\nrealized vol spread between HSCEI and SPX as long as HSCEI stays within 70-110% of\nits initial level. Pricing of corridor variance is cheaper than vanilla variance as investors\ncan avoid paying for the rich HSCEI convexity below the 70% barrier. The trade has a\npositive carry and benefits during China risk-off events.\n\nNote that the potential HSCEI index enhancement will reduce the financial weightings in\nHSCEI from 70% to 50% and lower realized volatility by 1.8 vol points. However, the\nenhancement will be implemented in stages. It will probably start in Dec-17 at the\nearliest and will not be fully implemented by the end of 2018, in our view.\n\nIndicative pricing (As of 19-Jun-17)\nBuy HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 70/110% corridor variance swap: 5 vol points\n\ndeg oes Bankof America\n16 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014987",
