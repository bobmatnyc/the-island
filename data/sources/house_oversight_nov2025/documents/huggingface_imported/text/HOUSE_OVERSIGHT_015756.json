  "text": "66 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nThe exchange of notes goes on for a few days and the two seem to be\ngetting on well. There is even a little romance in the air. When the week is\nover I open the door and the two meet. The graduate student says, “Hello.\nIt’s nice to finally meet you in person.’ The man is puzzled because, of\ncourse, she has spoken to him in Chinese. He knows no Chinese.\n\n“Tm terribly sorry, but I don’t speak Chinese,” he says.\n\nShe is puzzled, “But I spoke with you this last week!”\n\n“No, I really don't speak it,” he says.\n\nAnd, of course, he is telling the truth. The book he has been using\ncontains the rules for answering questions in Chinese, but he has\nabsolutely no knowledge of the language. I'll leave to your imagination\nwhether the two strike up a real relationship and live happily ever after.\n\nThis is the Story of the Chinese Room. The setup is able to fool\nsomeone into believing there is a Chinese speaking person in the room,\nyet there is not. Where does the understanding of Chinese lie? The man\ndefinitely does not understand Chinese. And the book clearly does not\nunderstand Chinese because it is an inanimate object. Yet the person\noutside the room is convinced she is communicating with a Chinese\nspeaker. The analogy to a computer is clear. The book is software and\nthe man blindly following instructions is the hardware. John Searle,\nwho devised the thought experiment uses it to show computers can\nnever understand because there is no place in a mechanistic system for\nunderstanding to exist.\n\nThe Chinese Room has sparked huge argument in philosophical\ncircles; let me boil it down to its simplest form. First, let's refute Searle's\nposition with the ‘System Argument.\n\nThe man plus the book form a system. Systems understand; their\nindividual components do not. My blood does not understand. My brain\nwithout blood would not understand — it would be dead! Plug my brain\ninto a good supply of blood; add a dash of glucose, and it will understand\nthe most complex of things.\n\nThe systems argument is elegant and most scientists think this is the\ndefinitive argument against Searle, but Searle has a neat way to counter\nit. “Imagine”, he says, “that the man memorizes the book and leaves the\nroom. Now there is no system, there is just the man, but the man still does\nnot understand Chinese; he is just parroting rote-memorized words and\nrules.” Computers, Searle argues, process syntax — the rules of language;\nhumans understand semantics — the contextual meaning of language.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) proponents hate the Searle argument.\nThey believe the memorization of a set of words and rules is exactly what\ngives us knowledge of Chinese. That is why we go to school!\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015756",
