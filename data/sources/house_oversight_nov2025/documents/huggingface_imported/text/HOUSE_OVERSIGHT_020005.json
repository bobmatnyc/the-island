  "text": "maturity but sagaciousness, the Tea Party-Bannon-Breitbart wing mounted an ad hominem\ncampaign pushing an image of Ryan as uncommitted to the cause, an inept strategist and\nincompetent leader. He was the Tea Party-Bannon-Breitbart punch line: the ultimate empty\nsuit, a hee-haw sort of joke and an embarrassment.\n\nTrump’s distaste for Ryan was significantly less structural. He had no views about\nRyan’s political abilities, and had paid no real attention to Ryan’s actual positions. His\nview was personal. Ryan had insulted him—again and again. Ryan had kept betting\nagainst him. Ryan had become the effective symbol of the Republican establishment’s\nhorror and disbelief about Trump. Adding insult to injury, Ryan had even achieved some\nmoral stature by dissing Trump (and, as usual, he considered anybody’s gain at his\nexpense a double insult). By the spring of 2016, Ryan was still, and by then the only,\nalternative to Trump as the nominee. Say the word, many Republicans felt, and the\nconvention would stampede to Ryan. But Ryan’s seemingly smarter calculation was to let\nTrump win the nomination, and then to emerge as the obvious figure to lead the party after\nTrump’s historic defeat and the inevitable purge of the Tea Party-Trump-Breitbart wing.\n\nInstead, the election destroyed Paul Ryan, at least in Steve Bannon’s eyes. Trump had\nnot only saved the Republican Party but had given it a powerful majority. The entire\nBannon dream had been realized. The Tea Party movement, with Trump as its remarkable\nface and voice, had come to power—something like total power. It owned the Republican\nParty. Publicly breaking Paul Ryan was the obvious and necessary step.\n\nBut a great deal could fall into the chasm between Bannon’s structural contempt for\nRyan and Trump’s personal resentment. If Bannon saw Ryan as being unwilling and\nunable to carry out the new Bannon-Trump agenda, Trump saw a chastened Ryan as\nsuddenly and satisfyingly abject, submissive, and useful. Bannon wanted to get rid of the\nentire Republican establishment; Trump was wholly satisfied that it now seemed to bend\nto him.\n\n“He’s quite a smart guy,” Trump said after his first postelection conversation with the\nSpeaker. “A very serious man. Everybody respects him.”\n\nRyan, “rising to a movie-version level of flattery and sucking-up painful to witness,”\naccording to one senior Trump aide, was able to delay his execution. As Bannon pressed\nhis case for Meadows—who was significantly less yielding than Ryan—Trump dithered\nand then finally decided that not only was he not going to push for Ryan’s ouster, but Ryan\nwas going to be his man, his partner. In an example of the odd and unpredictable effects of\npersonal chemistry on Trump—of how easy it can be to sell the salesman—Trump would\nnow eagerly back Ryan’s agenda instead of the other way around.\n\n“T don’t think that we quite calculated that the president would give him carte blanche,”\nreflected Katie Walsh. “The president and Paul went from such a bad place during the\ncampaign to such a romance afterward that the president was happy to go along with\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020005",
