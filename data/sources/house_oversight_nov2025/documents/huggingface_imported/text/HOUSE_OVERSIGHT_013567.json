  "text": "in relationships, | continue to be erotically spellbound, in love with them in all their\nforms. Questions about how to think about these exquisitely sensitive women, Bell’s\nSyndrome exists but is rarer in men, continue to drive aspects of my scientific\nresearch. It has been variegated quest, which began with trying to find a general\nconceptual framework that would help my understanding of this unique capacity to\nbe aware and process large amounts of internal and external information that\nescape the awareness of most of us. As one might guess, this search led to\nfundamental ideas about information and its inverse, the entropy indicating the\namount of information transport capacity, with respect to their characterization,\nquantification and measurement.\n\nTo get to the end from close to the beginning, we recall that it was Claude\nShannon and his followers who both mathematically proved and experimentally\nverified that a receiver must have more entropy, less already fixed knowledge and\nmore wondering, than the sending source, in order for the message to be sensitively\nand reliably received and encoded. Sensibility seems to have something to do with\nthe readiness for information transmission afforded by the brain’s high entropy,\nminimal fixed information states, in its resting dynamics. Their remarkable\nreceptivity derives from a baseline brain state like the formless emptiness of the\n\nt\n\nbodhisattva’s “...no form, no sound, no_ feelings, no _ perceptions, no\n\nn\n\nconsciousness...” of transcendent Tibetan Buddhism as described in the Heart\nSutra of The Dalai Lama.\n\nIn Chinese Medicine, xu, meaning emptiness, contrasts with shi, the word for\nfullness, both of these complementary opposites having multiple specific meanings.\nMost metaphysically relevant is the characterization of xu as the emptiness of the\ndeepest reality of being and the highest state of human spirituality. Like that aspect\nof Lao-Tsu’s ineffable Dao, The Way that is empty, xu indicates a mind devoid of\ndesire, being lucid and serene. In the context of dynamical form, xu shares the\nstructureless, non-imagery of maximal entropy systems and shi the lower dynamical\nentropy of fixations on form, desires and beliefs. Shigehisa Kuriyama’s The\nExpressiveness of the Body, elucidating historical and conceptual divergences of\n\nGreek and Chinese Medicine, notes that xu was the supreme end of self-cultivation\n\n67\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013567",
