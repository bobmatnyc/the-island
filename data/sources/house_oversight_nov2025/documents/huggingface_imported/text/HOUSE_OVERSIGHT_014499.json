However, the federal govern-\nment usually offers a credit of 5.4\npercent, meaning most employers ac-\ntually pay about 0.6 percent, accord-\ning to the IRS.\n\nStates — and territories — with\nunemployment insurance programs\nmeeting federal standards are re-\nquired to meet their unemployment\nobligations. When a state can’t meet\nits unemployment obligations, it’s\nentitled to take loans from the Fed-\neral Unemployment Insurance Trust\nFund.\n\nFederal documents show only one\nstate and one jurisdiction — Califor-\nnia and the U.S. Virgin Islands — are\ncurrently in that position.\n\nThe territory owes $69,138,266.61\nin loans, according to the U.S. De-\npartment of Treasury website.\n\nIn fiscal year 2017, which be-\ngan Oct. 1, the loans have accrued\n$294,349.15 in interest payments\nalone.\n\nThe VI. Labor Department is in\ncharge of administering unemploy-\nment insurance. Labor Commission-\ner Catherine Hendry did not return a\nnumber of phone calls seeking com-\nment.\n\nGovernment House spokeswoman\nCherie Munchez would not com-\nment, saying that Hendry would issue\na prepared statement about the debt\nby Wednesday.\n\nProvisions of the Federal Unem-\nployment Tax Act stipulate that in\nstates or territories with outstanding\nbalances in the fund, businesses are\nsubject to a credit reduction, which is\ncollected and directed toward the un-\npaid balance, according to Robert Pa-\nvosevich, Supervisor of the Actuarial\nTeam in the Office of Unemployment\n\nInsurance’s Division of Fiscal and\nActuarial Services in the Department\nof Labor.\n\nVirgin Islands business owners\nwill pay the original 0.6 percent, plus\nan additional 1.8 percent caused by\nthe unpaid balance, for a total of 2.4\npercent, Pavosevich said.\n\nAt the fully discounted rate, an\nemployer would pay $42 for each\nemployee earning $7,000. At the Vir-\ngin Islands rate, employers will have\nto pay $168.\n\nAfter two years with an unpaid\nbalance, the discount decreases by\n0.3 percent each year until the total\ndiscount disappears, Pavosevich said.\n\n“It’s capped at 6 percent,” Pavosev-\nich said.\n\nAt the full 6 percent, employers\nwill have to pay $420 for each new\nemployee earning $7,000 that comes\non board. By law, that money can’t\ncome out of the wages themselves\nand is paid out of the profits or losses\nthat employers face, said Charles\nEngeman, an attorney who served on\nthe Unemployment Insurance Advi-\nsory Council under the administra-\ntion of Goy. John deJongh Jr.\n\nWithout payment on the loan — or\nwaivers or relief, which has happened\nthree times since 2013 — the rate is\nscheduled to max out by 2028. That’s\nbarring the imposition of step in-\ncreases, which can happen if the state\nhas an outstanding balance for a cer-\ntain number of years, or if — as was\nthe case in the tax year 2012 — step\nincreases are piled on by other provi-\nsions of the law, which could move\nthe unemployment tax rate up faster.\n\n“Tt looks like they’re not making\nmuch headway,” Pavosevich said, re-\nferring to the territory’s debt.\n\nThe territory wasn’t alone in 2011,\nthe first year the rate went up. In all,\n20 states and the Virgin Islands re-\nceived a 0.3 percent credit reduction\nthat year, federal documents show.\n\nThat’s in part because of the linger-\ning effects of the Great Recession,\nsaid Bennett Chan, a lawyer who\nrepresents several businesses and has\nworked with the St. Thomas-St. John\nChamber of Commerce in the past.\n\n| don’t think there’s enough political willpower to do\nthe kinds of thing necessary to fix the system.\n\n— Charles Engeman,\n\nan attorney who served on the Unemployment Insurance Advisory\nCouncil under the administration of Gov. John deJongh Jr.\n\nThe business owners always bear the brunt of\nwhatever deficiencies we have. We have to, at some\npoint, find other sources of revenue for the\ngovernment. Any time there's any sort of additional\ntax burden, fee burden, licensing burden, it’s always\n\na point of concern.\n\n— Kimberly McCollum,\n\npresident of the St. Croix Chamber of Commerce\n\nIn general terms, states collected\nmore money than they paid out dur-\ning the years leading up to the 2008\nmarket collapse, creating large sur-\npluses. Sometimes those surpluses\nwere subject to financial raids. Other\ntimes — as was the case in the ter-\nritory — the surpluses were used as\na cause to reduce the amounts col-\nlected for unemployment insurance.\nWhen large-scale unemployment hit\nas a result of the recession, surpluses\nturned into deficits, Chan said.\n\n“A lot of states were blindsided\nby the Great Recession,’ Chan said.\n“They also had big surpluses and\nnever foresaw that there would be\nthis sudden inflow in unemployment\nclaims.”\n\nTerritorial officials were late in re-\nacting to bring the rate back up to ad-\ndress the issue, Chan said.\n\n“Tf we had done it earlier, we prob-\nably would have collected enough,”\nhe said. “Now they want to make it\nup when times are hard.”\n\nIn many cases, the government\ncan’t say what each employer owes\n\nor has paid in surplus, Engeman said.\n\nThe system originally was set up so\nthat employers faced a roller coaster,\nEngeman said.\n\nEach employer had a rate based\non a three-year average. If an em-\nployer’s account paid out more in\nbenefits than they contributed, the\nrate would go up to 5.4 percent. After\nthree years, the employer's rate would\ndrop down to 0.1 percent, because at\n5.4 percent, the rate exceeded likely\ncontributions.\n\nAt 0.1 percent, if anyone were laid\noff, it immediately moved the em-\nployer back to the 5.4 percent rate.\nEmployers would oscillate between\nthe 5.4 percent rate and the 0.1 per-\ncent rate.\n\n“Tt was 5.4 for many employers,\nand that’s what an average employer\nwould pay out over the course of 17\nyears for one employee,” Engeman\nsaid.\n\nAs a result, the unemployment\ninsurance fund accumulated large\nsurpluses. To reduce the surpluses,\nthe VI. Labor Department dropped\n\nthe automatic increase based on a\nnegative account, and lowered the\nminimum rate to 0. Less money came\nin, even as unemployment rates re-\nmained high and benefits remained\nexpensive.\n\nA few steps could help move\nthe system back to sound footing,\nEngeman said. For example, better\nrecord-keeping would help reduce\ndelinquencies. Reducing unem-\nployment insurance benefits and\nreducing the amount of time the\nunemployed are eligible for unem-\nployment would both help. Verify-\ning that those collecting unemploy-\nment are seeking employment, and\ngenerally reducing fraud also would\nhelp, Engeman said.\n\n“T don’t think there’s enough politi-\ncal willpower to do the kinds of thing\nnecessary to fix the system,” he said.\n\nChamber of Commerce officials\non both islands decried any increase\nin taxes or fees for businesses.\n\n“Despite what the governor and\nthe senators think, the economy of\nthe Virgin Islands is not doing that\nwell,” said Tom Brunt III, a member\nof the St. Thomas-St. John Chamber\nof Commerce Board of Directors.\n\nKimberly McCollum, president of\nthe St. Croix Chamber of Commerce,\nsaid any increases to fees or taxes was\nworrying.\n\n“The business owners always bear\nthe brunt of whatever deficiencies we\nhave,” she said. “We have to, at some\npoint, find other sources of revenue\nfor the government. Any time there’s\nany sort of additional tax burden, fee\nburden, licensing burden, it’s always\na point of concern.”\n\nThe folly of the situation is com-\npounded by the fact that business\nowners themselves aren’t allowed to\nfile for unemployment if they lose\ntheir jobs, McCollum said.\n\n“You're still paying unemployment\ntaxes on what you’re paid, but you are\nnot allowed to request compensation\nshould you find yourself in a position\nto file for unemployment,” she said.\n\n— Contact Brian O'Connor at\n340-714-9130 or email boconnor@\ndailynews.vi.\n\nISSN 2159-3019\n\nDaily News Publishing Co.
