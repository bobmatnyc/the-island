Shortly after this sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Katie\nJohnson, Plaintiff Johnson was still present while the two Defendants were arguing over who would\nbe the one to take Plaintiff Johnson's virginity. The Defendant, Donald J. Trump, was clearly heard\nreferring to Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, as a \"Jew Bastard\" as he yelled at Defendant Epstein, that\nclearly, he, Defendant Trump, should be the lucky one to \"pop the cherry\" of Plaintiff Johnson.\n\n16. The third and final sexual assault by the Defendant, Jeffrey E. Epstein, on the Plaintiff, Kati\nJohnson, took place after Plaintiff Johnson had been brutally and savagely raped by Defendant\nTrump. While receiving another full body massage from Plaintiff Johnson, while in the nude,\nDefendant Epstein became so enraged after finding out that Defendant Trump had been the one to\ntake Plaintiff Johnson's virginity, that Defendant Epstein also violently raped Plaintiff Johnson.\nAfter forcing Plaintiff Johnson to disrobe into her bra and panties, while receiving a massage from\nthe Plaintiff, Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson's anal cavity with his erect\npenis while trying to restrain her. Plaintiff Johnson attempted to push Defendant Epstein away, at\nwhich time Defendant Epstein attempted to enter Plaintiff Johnson's vagina with his erect penis.\nThis attempt to brutally sodomize and rape Plaintiff Johnson by Defendant Epstein was finally\nrepelled by Plaintiff Johnson but not before Defendant Epstein was able to achieve sexual orgasm.\nAfter perversely sodomizing and raping the Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, the Defendant, Jeffrey E.\nEpstein, attempted to strike her about the head with his closed fists while he angrily screamed at\nPlaintiff Johnson that he, Defendant Epstein, should have been the one who \"took her cherry, not\nMr. Trump\", before she finally managed to break away from Defendant Epstein.\n\n17. The Plaintiff, Katie Johnson, was fully warned on more than one occasion by both\nDefendants, Donald J. Trump and Jeffrey E. Epstein, that were she ever to reveal any of the details\nof the sexual and physical abuse that she had suffered as a sex slave for Defendant Trump and\nDefendant Epstein, that Plaintiff Johnson and her family would be in mortal danger. Plaintiff\nJohnson was warned that this would mean certain death for herself and Plaintiff Johnson's family\nunless she remained silent forever on the exact details of the depraved and perverted sexual and\nphysical abuse she had been forced to endure from the Defendants.\n\n4\n\nCV-126 (09/09) PLEADING PAGE FOR A COMPLAINT\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029263",
