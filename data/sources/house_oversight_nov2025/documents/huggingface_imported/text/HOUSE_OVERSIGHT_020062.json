  "text": "Among Bannon’s many regular targets, Powell had become a favorite. She was often\nbilled as Deputy National Security Advisor; that was her sometime designation even in the\nNew York Times. Actually, she was Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategy—the\ndifference, Bannon pointed out, between the COO of a hotel chain and the concierge.\n\nComing back from the overseas trip, Powell began to talk in earnest to friends about\nher timetable to get out of the White House and back into a private-sector job. Sheryl\nSandberg, she said, was her model.\n\n“Oh my fucking god,” said Bannon.\n\nOn May 26, the day before the presidential party returned from the overseas trip, the\nWashington Post reported that during the transition, Kushner and Sergey Kislyak, the\nRussian ambassador, had, at Kushner’s instigation, discussed the possibility of having the\nRussians set up a private communications channel between the transition team and the\nKremlin. The Post cited “U.S. officials briefed on intelligence reports.” The Jarvanka side\nbelieved that Bannon was the source.\n\nPart of the by now deep enmity between the First Family couple and their allies and\nBannon and his team was the Jarvanka conviction that Bannon had played a part in many\nof the reports of Kushner’s interactions with the Russians. This was not, in other words,\nmerely an internal policy war; it was a death match. For Bannon to live, Kushner would\nhave to be wholly discredited—pilloried, investigated, possibly even jailed.\n\nBannon, assured by everyone that there was no winning against the Trump family,\nhardly tried to hide his satisfied belief that he was going to outplay them. In the Oval\nOffice, in front of her father, Bannon openly attacked her. “You,” he said, pointing at her\nas the president watched, “are a fucking liar.” Ivanka’s bitter complaints to her father,\nwhich in the past had diminished Bannon, were now met by a hands-off Trump: “TI told\nyou this is a tough town, baby.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nBut if Bannon was back, it was far from clear what being back meant. Trump being\nTrump, was this true rehabilitation, or did he feel an even deeper rancor toward Bannon\nfor having survived his initial intention to kill him? Nobody really thought Trump forgot\n—instead, he dwelled and ruminated and chewed. “One of the worst things is when he\nbelieves you’ve succeeded at his expense,” explained Sam Nunberg, once on the inside of\nthe Trump circle, then cast to the outside. “If your win is in any way perceived as his loss,\nphew.”\n\nFor his part, Bannon believed he was back because, at a pivotal moment, his advice\nhad proved vastly better than that of the “geniuses.” Firing Comey, the solve-all-problems\nJarvanka solution, had indeed unleashed a set of terrible consequences.\n\nThe Jarvanka side believed that Bannon was in essence blackmailing the president.
