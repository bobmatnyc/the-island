  "text": "woven into his performances. But as clubs became increasingly afraid to\nhire him, he devoted more and more time and energy to the law.\n\nIn less than two years, Lenny was arrested 15 times. Club owners\nwere afraid to book him. He couldn’ t get a gig in six months. On a\nChristmas day, he was alone in his hotel room, and | brought him a $500\nbill. With a large safety pin, he attached it to his denim jacket. When he\nfinally got a booking in Monterey, he admitted, “I feel like it's taking me\naway from my work.”\n\nLenny lived way up in the hills. His house was protected by barbed\nwire and a concrete gate, except that it was always open. He had a wall-to-\nwall one-way mirror in his living room, but when the sun was shining you\ncould see into the room instead of out. He was occasionally hassled by\npolice on his own property. One evening in October 1963, we were talking\nwhile he was shaving, when four officers suddenly appeared, loud and\nobnoxious. He asked them to leave unless they had a search warrant.\n\nOne of the cops took out his gun. “Here's my search warrant,” he\nsaid. Then Lenny and the cops had a discussion about the law, such as the\nrules of evidence, and after half an hour they left. Lenny tried to take it all\nin stride, but the encounter was depressing, and he changed his mind\n\nabout going out that night.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030193",
