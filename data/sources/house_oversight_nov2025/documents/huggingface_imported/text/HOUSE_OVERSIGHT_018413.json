  "text": "symphonic effort, each note and instrument in place. Grand strategy tells us what to\ndo at every moment.\n\nAny policy, then, must begin with a summary of our aims: “We believe the world is\nentering a period of profound change that demands a shift in global arrangements.\nWeare building a gatekept order consistent with our values. We welcome others to\nparticipate in it - but with conditions. We will resist attempts to force nations into\nany gatekept order; we will fight any forces that threaten disruption of the overall\nsystem.” The China policy that emerges from this view is clear enough: We will not\ncontain China. We will not force China to change. Rather we will develop a profound\ngatekept network for our own operation, one that layers together all the concerns of\neconomics, trade, security and technology - as if we were designing a technical\nsystem for fast, constant links. We will include other nations that want to be a part\nof it, as long as they are willing to bear certain costs. China is welcome to develop\nher own system and see whom she might attract inside. She will not be permitted to\ncompel nations to join. And: If China wants the benefits of a US-led order, then\nBeijing must be prepared to support the maintenance of that order. That means\ndeeper cooperation on everything from nuclear proliferation to the establishment of\nnew international bodies for connected finance, biological research or nuclear de-\nproliferation.\n\nSuch an approach resolves, in an instant, the contradictions of our current policy.\nHere is our gated order, we can say, join ifyou wish and on the terms we both consider\nbest. We should remember: China has much to worry about. Disorder would land on\nher own hopes for peace and development with a profound, possibly crushing\npressure. The international order is not working as well as it might. It does not\nappear engineered for new stresses. It is in cooperation for the reform of that\nsystem that the two nations share an urgent interest. And it is in a successful\ndefensive posture of a gatekept, network order that Washington can cultivate the\nlinked, leveraged moves that will encourage this to happen. While there might be a\ntemptation to play this game in that old Lloyd George sort of way - “We need the\nMiddle East. Grab it. We need digital currency mastery. Take it!” - such efforts will\nonly assure final, fatal collision between the two powers. We need a gatekept order.\nBuild it. That is enough.\n\nWhat the Seventh Sense statesman sees, in the way a Seventh Sense entrepreneur or\nterrorist or researcher can, is the pulsing network logic that is at work breeding a\nnew world - like it or not. And our policy has to aim for that future state, not for\nwhat we have today. If this sounds difficult, you should know that in most complex\nadaptive systems these kinds of adjustments frequently occur. Rainforests. Traffic\njams. The human brain. Anyplace connections are knit and reknit at light speed can\nexhibit a pattern of rapid redevelopment: The world changes. The network and its\nvarious pieces hum, in response, to a new order. Climate shift in the Amazon, for\ninstance, produces drier air. The pollination cycle shortens. Flowers must adjust by\ngrowing longer leaves to protect their moisture. Birds that rely on the flowers\ndevelop longer, sharper beaks in response. In this way bird and flower each become\nbetter suited to a warmer age. They co-evolve. We see this sort of interaction in\n\n181\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018413",
