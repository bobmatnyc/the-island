School officials are appealing J.D. Parker\nSchool of Science, Math & Technology’s B grade. The Stuart\nelementary school had enough points to be considered an “A”\nschool, but because the lowest 25 percent of the school’s students\ndidn’t make learning gains, the state dropped the grade to a B.\n\nMartin had the second-highest percentage of A schools\namong the state’s 67 counties. Gilchrist County had the highest\npercentage of A’s, though the county in northeastern Florida only\nhas four schools.\n\nThe district is also filing an appeal for Warfield Elementary\nin Indiantown. The school received an A, but did not make\nadequate yearly progress under the federal No Child Left Behind\nAct, state data shows.\n\nThe result of all this is that teachers are now being “held accountable”\nfor their teaching, which is another way of saying, Get those test scores\nup or else.\n\nThe following is from an article on the front page of the New York\nTimes (December 23, 2007):\n\nMr. Obama, for instance, in a speech last month in New\nHampshire denounced the law (NCLB) as “demoralizing our\nteachers.” But he also said it was right to hold all children to\nhigh standards. “The goals of this law were the right ones,” he\nsaid.\n\nWhen Mtr. Edwards released an education plan earlier this\nyear, he said the No Child law needed a “total overhaul.” But he\nsaid he would continue the law’s emphasis on accountability.\n\nAnd at the elementary school in Waterloo, Mrs. Clinton said\nshe would “do everything I can as senator, but if we don’t get it\ndone, then as president, to end the unfunded mandate known as\nNo Child Left Behind.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023830",
