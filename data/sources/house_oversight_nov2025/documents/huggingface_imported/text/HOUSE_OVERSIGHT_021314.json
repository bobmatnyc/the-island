  "text": "to connect people in a religious service.\nAlthough joint participation in any event\n(such as sports or theatre) may have\nsome of the same effect as discussed by\nGiin Semin, the content of language and\nthe intent of the messages in religious\npractice is often focused on developing\nand strengthening social and spiritual\nconnections.\n\nEveryone knows someone who\nmoved to another country, or to another\npart of their own country where speech\npatterns differ. After a period of time, in\nthe context of novel speech patterns,\nsome people adopt the speech patterns\naround them. This kind of linguistic\nconvergence is well documented and is\nmoderated by social factors such as the\ndesire to be accepted or the attempt to be\npersuasive.’ When people talk together,\none person’s speech can impact the way\nanother person talks in order to promote\nsocial connection. Indeed, the same kind\nof behavioral convergence is found over\nthe course of conversations for other\nkinds of non-linguistic actions as well.”\n\nInformation, impact, and\nunderstanding\n\nHow does language bind us\ntogether and compel us to action,\nthought, and feeling? When we talk,\nsound vibration is transmitted from\nmouth to ears. Facial expressions and\nmanual gestures punctuate, illustrate,\nand illuminate our speech. These\nacoustic and visual signals travel over\nspace and time to the eyes and ears of\nthe audience. The impact of such\ncommunication is true action at a\ndistance.\n\nThis notion of language as action\nat a distance is relatively well accepted\nin the scientific study of language. But\nin research on language and\ncommunication by psycholinguists and\n\nPage | 68\n\nlinguists, the emphasis is on the\ninformation contained within an\nutterance and the structure and form by\nwhich this information is presented.\nResearch questions often focus on the\nvariety of ways the same message can be\nframed and how listeners interpret such\nmessages. But little of this work\naddresses the impact of the message\nitself.\n\nThe standard view of language\nprocessing is that we hear the sounds of\nspeech (acoustic patterns) that we\ntranslate mentally into words. The\nmeanings of these words are determined\nand then the meanings combined\n(through our knowledge of sentence\nstructure) to result in sentence meaning.\nGiven that a sentence typically occurs in\na context of other sentences (e.g., a\nsermon) or in response to other speech\n(e.g., a conversation), this context is then\nused to frame and reinterpret the\nsentence meaning.\n\nMetaphor, irony, sarcasm, and\nother figures are generally thought of as\nbeing understood later in this process\nalthough in Gilpin’s chapter the\nimmediate power of these to affect us is\nquite clear. Emotion and attitudes are\nthought of as not understood until after\nthe linguistic message has been\ndetermined. The impact of language on\nattitudes through persuasion is viewed\nby cognitive psychology and linguistics\nas occurring after the message has been\nunderstood. However, this does raise the\nquestion about whether a “message” (to\nbe understood) is simply the linguistic\nproperties of a sentence or the impact of\nthe linguistic form on an audience.\n\nA very different view of\nlanguage might come from considering\nvocal communications that often have a\ndirect impact on an audience.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021314",
