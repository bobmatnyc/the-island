  "text": "reproduce... one consequence is\nthat selfish genes evolved\nthrough individual-level selection\nprocesses to promote social\npreferences and group processes,\nincluding reciprocal social\nbehaviors, that can extend\nbeyond kin relationships\n\nThe concept of inclusive fitness helps to\nexplain why humans care for the young\nwhen they are sick, and even why they\ncare for those who when healthy are able\nto contribute to caring for the young. In\naddition, it may be that hunter-gatherers\nwere more likely to survive and\nreproduce when they cared for a\nwounded or sickened member of the\nclan—thereby establishing an\nexpectation of reciprocity that would\ncontribute to social cohesion, collective\neffort, and defense of other group\nmembers. These provide at least the\nrudiments of an evolutionary rationale\nfor the practice of medicine.\n\nYet, medicine does not involve\ncaring merely (or even primarily) for the\nyoung, much less for those who are most\ngenetically fit. Rather, medicine in large\nmeasure involves caring for those who\neither have no capacity to contribute to\nthe gene pool because they are aged and\notherwise infertile, or whose\ncontributions to that pool will reduce\npopulation fitness because they are\ngenetically predisposed to sickness and\ndisability. Concern about the latter led\nFrancis Galton and many of his\nAmerican and European contemporaries\nto embrace social Darwinism and to\nchampion efforts to keep the diminished\nand infirm from reproducing. In the\nUnited States, the eugenics movement\nwas memorialized in the infamous words\nof Supreme Court justice Oliver Wendell\nHolmes, who justified the\nconstitutionality of the forced\n\n141\n\nPage\n\nsterilization of mentally ‘unfit’ women\nin the case of Buck v. Bell by writing,\n“Three generations of imbeciles are\nenough.” Sterilization rates under\neugenic laws in the United States\nincreased following this ruling until the\nSkinner v. Oklahoma case in 1942, after\nwhich point they declined.\n\nThe practice of medicine\nexpresses more than a straightforward\nsocial instinct for protecting the young.\nTo borrow from Browning, it may be\nthat medicine builds on and extends the\ndynamic of inclusive fitness much like in\nCatholic moral theology caritas (love)\nbuilds on and extends eros (desire).\nBrowning writes, “[Aquinas] held — and\nChristianity has always taught — that\nChristian love includes more than kin\naltruism and the care of our familial\noffspring; it must include the love of\nneighbor, stranger, and enemy, even to\nthe point of self-sacrifice.” The\ntheological concept of God as creator\nand Father of all “made it possible for\nChristians to build on yet analogically\ngeneralize their kin altruism to all\nchildren of God, even those beyond the\nimmediate family, their own children\nand their own kin.” Even those beyond\nthe reasonable hope of reproducing or\nhelping others to reproduce.\n\nNotably, the self-conscious\ncommitments that animate medicine do\nnot include promoting population fitness\nor ensuring survival of offspring to the\npoint of reproduction. Rather, physicians\ndiscipline themselves to practices that\nmake possible the commitment of\nmedicine: to preserve and restore the\nhealth of patients, notwithstanding\npatients’ other characteristics. Religions\nground this care for the sick in sacred\nand transcendent obligations to God and\nneighbor, and it is not incidental that the\nhospital began when Christian monastic\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021387",
