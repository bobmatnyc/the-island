Only the\nmost naive observer would exclude the possibility that if the Iranians did get a\nnuclear weapon, they might use it. And even if they didn’t, the entire strategic\npicture would change, with the need to find a response not just to a nuclear Iran,\nbut potentially a nuclear Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Turkey.\n\nI was not about to lecture President Obama on this. While Bibi liked to portray\nhim variously as weak, naive or tone-deaf to interests and security of Israel, I knew\nfrom our previous meetings that he was none of these things. Yet I did, ina\ndeliberately non-didactic way, raise the issue of our different perspectives on the\nIranians’ getting nuclear arms. “You see it in the context of the whole world,” I\ntold the President. “If Iran, in spite of all our efforts, gets a nuclear weapon, yes, it\nwill be bad. But for you, it’s just one more nuclear state. It won’t dramatically\nchange the situation for America. For us, it can turn into a real, existential threat.”\n\nHe agreed that we inevitably looked at the situation differently. But after\npausing a few seconds, he said: “Ehud, think of it this way. You get to school in\nthe morning and there’s this big, nasty bully. You can take him on, maybe give\nhim a black eye. But you have this bigger, stronger friend, who can knock him out\ncold. The only problem is that your friend won’t be there until the afternoon.”\n\nI would have liked nothing more than to wait for our “bigger, stronger” friend,\nespecially since I knew through my contacts in the American military and\nintelligence establishment how much bigger and stronger an American attack\nwould be. During the first couple of years that Israel was working on acquiring the\ncapability for a military strike, the Americans had been no more ready than we\nwere. They did have the tanker aircraft and the heavy bombs. But their plan —a\nkind of Iraq-style shock and awe — was so obviously prone to lead to a wider\nconflict that it would never have received the go-ahead from President Obama, or\nprobably any president. I used to joke with colleagues in the Pentagon that while\nIsrael’s idea of a “surgical operation” was the equivalent of a scalpel, they seemed\nto favor a chisel and a ten-pound hammer. By the time I met the President in 2012,\nthat had changed. Under Gates and then Panetta, an intensive research-and-\ndevelopment effort and enormously improved planning and training had yielded\nresults. The Americans now had high-precision heavy munitions we couldn’t\ndream of, and stealth air-attack capabilities we also lacked. They had an\noperational plan which, within a period of hours, could push the Iranian nuclear\n\n425\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028273",
