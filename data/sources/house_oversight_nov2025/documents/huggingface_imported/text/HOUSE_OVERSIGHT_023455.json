These explanations are called \"beautiful\" or \"elegant\". Historical\nexamples are Kepler's explanation of complex planetary motions as simple ellipses, Bohr's explanation of the\nperiodic table of the elements in terms of electron shells, and Watson and Crick's double helix. Einstein\nfamously said that he did not need experimental confirmation of his general theory of relativity because it \"was\nso beautiful it had to be true.\"\n\n>>\n\n>> The EDGE Question 2012\n\nSis\n\n>> WHAT IS YOUR FAVORITE DEEP, ELEGANT, OR BEAUTIFUL EXPLANATION?\n\nSis\n\n>> Since this question is about explanation, answers may embrace scientific thinking in the broadest sense: as\nthe most reliable way of gaining knowledge about anything, including other fields of inquiry such as\nphilosophy, mathematics, economics, history, political theory, literary theory, or the human spirit. The only\nrequirement is that some simple and non-obvious idea explain some diverse and complicated set of phenomena.\n‘obs\n\n>> [Thanks to Steven Pinker for suggesting this year's EDGE Question and to Stewart Brand, Kevin Kelly, and\nGeorge Dyson for their ongoing advice and support. |\n\nSebs\n\nDD me cn ne ne ne ne nnn nn ne nn ne en nn nn ee nn nn nn ne nn nn ne ne nn re enn nn enn ee nnn nn ne ee\n\nDD me cn ne ne ne ne nnn nn ne nn ne en nn nn ee nn nn nn ne nn nn ne ne nn re enn nn enn ee nnn nn ne ee\n\n=>\n>> \"Open-minded, free ranging, intellectually playful ... an unadorned pleasure in curiosity, a collective\n\nexpression of wonder at the living and inanimate world ... an ongoing and thrilling colloquium.\"\n>>\n\n>> —lan McEwan in THE TELEGRAPH\n\n>>\n\nSE ee I\n\n=\n\n>> SUBMITTING ESSAYS: Email as text or attached Word file to me (brockman@edge.org).\n=\n\n>> DUE DATE: 5pm, Thursday, January 12th\n\n>>\n\n>> PUBLICATION DATE: 12am EST, Sunday, January 15th\n\n>>\n\n>> URL: Essays will be posted at this draft URL (not visible to search engines).
