  "text": "With negotiations frozen, the Palestinians turned to unilateral\nmeasures: seeking a United Nations vote admitting the State of\nPalestine to membership and getting dozens of countries to recognize\na Palestinian state. Meanwhile, their delegitimization campaign\nagainst Israel continued apace, especially in Europe, where calls for\nboycotts and sanctions spread. On the pro-Israel side there was also\nconsideration of unilateral measures—steps to head off the\nPalestinians diplomatically (several of which I described and\nsupported in the April 11 Weekly Standard).\n\nSome forlorn hope may still have existed inside the administration\nthat a compromise on construction could bring the Palestinians back\nto the table with the government of Israel—auntil the agreement\nbetween Hamas and Fatah was signed on April 27.
