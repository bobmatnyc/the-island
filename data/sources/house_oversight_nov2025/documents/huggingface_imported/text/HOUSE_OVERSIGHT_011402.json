PAGLIUCA: That is my position, your Honor.\n\nTHE. COURT: I think that's correct. Tell me why\n\nthat's wrong.\n\nr\n\nMR. CASSELL: All right. Thank you, your Honor.\nThe problem, as usual, is, yeah, her net worth doesn't\n\ncome in at the liability stage, but I think the defendant is\n\ntrying to get the camel's nose under the tent and say, oh, if\n\nfinancial issues don't come in, then you can't --\n\n7\n\nTHE COURT: Well, I don't know what financial issues\n\nyou mean.
