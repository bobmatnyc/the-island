  "text": "Bannon; He Is ‘As Dangerous\n\nby THOMAS D. WILLIAMS, PH.D.11 Mar 2018\n\nAs Steve Bannon continues his tour of Europe, energizing the anti-\nestablishment populist base, the mainstream media cannot help but\nadmit their admiration for his abilities, despite their dislike of his aims.\n\nIn this week’s issue, the left-wing German weekly Sern articulates the greatest fear of the European\nestablishment: that Bannon “could give the fragmented right in Europe a common ideology and rhetoric.”\nMany thought that the reign of the “Dark Lord” had ended, writes Gernot Kramper, when Steve Bannon left\nfirst the White House and then his role as executive chairman of Breitbart News. It turns out, however, that\nBannon’s adversaries had underestimated him, because he is “‘as dangerous as ever,” he confesses.\n\nKramper cannot conceal his respect for Bannon’s ability to move a crowd. He was greeted by “frenetic\napplause” in his recent address before France’s National Front party, Kramper writes, demonstrating his\n“Impressive potential,” which the writer describes as “dangerous.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025525",
