  "text": "p EPSTEIN from 1A\nasking questions and teenage girls\n\nstarted talking, a wave of legal\nresistance followed.\n\nTf Palm Beach police didn’t know\nquite who Jeffrey Epstein was, they\nfound out soon enough.\n\nEpstein, now 53, was a quintes-\nsential man of mystery. He amassed\nhis fortune and friends quietly,\nalways in the background as he\nnavigated New York high society.\n\nWhen he first attracted notice in\nthe early 1990s, it was on account of\nthe woman he was dating: Ghislaine\nMaxwell, daughter of the late British\nmedia tycoon Robert Maxwell.\n\nIn a lengthy article, headlined\n*The Mystery of Ghislaine Max-\nwell’s Secret Love,” the British Mail\non Sunday tabloid laid out specula-\ntive stories that the socialite’s beau\nwas a CIA spook, a math teacher, a\nconcert pianist or a corporate head-\nhunter.\n\n“But what is the truth about\nhim?” the newspaper wondered.\n“Like Maxwell, Epstein is both\nflamboyant and intensely private.”\n\nThe media frenzy did not begin\nin full until a decade later. In Sep-\ntember 2002, Epstein was flung into\nthe limelight when he flew Clinton\nand actors Kevin Spacey and Chris\nTucker to Africa on his private jet.\n\nSuddenly everyone wanted to\nknow who Epstein was. New York\nmagazine and Vanity Fair published\nlengthy profiles. The New York Post\nlisted him as one of the city’s most\neligible bachelors and began\ndescribing him in its gossip columns\nwith adjectives such as “mysterious”\nand “reclusive.”\n\nAlthough Epstein gave no inter-\nviews, the broad strokes of his past\nstarted to come into focus,\n\nBuilding a life of extravagance\n\nHe was born blue-collar in 1953,\nthe son of a New York City parks\ndepartment employee, and raised in\nBrookiyn’s Coney Island neighbor-\nhood. He left college without a\nbachelor’s degree but became a\nmath teacher at the prestigious\nDalton School in Manhattan.\n\nThe story goes that the father of\none of Epstein’s students was so\nimpressed with the man that he put\nhim in touch with a senior partner at\nBear Stearns, the global investment\nbank and securities firm.\n\nIn 1976, Epstein left Dalton for a\njob at Bear Stearns. By the early\n1980s, he had started J. Epstein and\nCo. That is when he began making\nhis millions in earnest,\n\n@\n\nfron,\n\nLittle is known or said about r\n\nEpstein’s business except this: He\nmanages money for the extremely\n\nwealthy. He is said to handle .\n\naccounts only of $1 billion or great-\ner.\nit has been estimated he has\n\n. roughly 15 clients, but their identt-\n- ties are the subject of only specula-\n\ntion. All except for one: Leslie Wex-\nner, founder of The Limited retail\n\n‘ chain and a former Palm Beacher\n\nwho is said to have been a mentor to\n\n- Epstein.\n\na\n\nWexner sold Epstein one of his\nmost lavish residences: a massive\ntownhouse that dominates a block\non Manhattan’s Upper East Side. It\nis reported to have, among its finer\nfeatures, closed-circuit television\nand a heated sidewalk to melt away\nfallen snow.\n\nThat townhouse, thought to be\nthe largest private residence in\nManhattan, is only a piece of the\nextravagant world Epstein built over\ntime.\n\nIn New Mexico, he constructed a\n27,000-square-foot hilltop mansion\nonai0,000-acre ranch outside Santa\nFe. Many believed itto be the largest\nhome in the state.\n\nIn Palm Beach, he bought a\nwaterfront home on Ei Brillo Way.\nAnd he owns a 100-acre private\nisland in the Virgin Islands.\n\nPerhaps as remarkable as his\nJavish homes is his extensive net-\nwork of friends and associates at the\nhighest echelons of power. This\nincludes not only socialites but also\nbusiness tycoons, media moguls,\npoliticians, royalty and Nobel Prize-\nwinning scientists whose research\n\n‘ he often funds.\n\n“Just like other people collect\nart, he collects scientists,” said\nMartin Nowak, who directs the\nProgram for Evolutionary Dynamics\nat Harvard University and was\n\nreportedly the recipient of a $30 °\nmillion research donation from ,\n\nEpstein.\n\nEpstein is said to have\nbefriended former Harvard Presi-\ndent Larry Summers, prominent law\n\n| Professor Alan Dershowitz, Donald\n* Trump and New York Daily News\n; Publisher Mort Zuckerman.\n\nAnd yét he managed for decades |\n\nto maintain a low profile. He avoids\n\n* eating out and was rarely photo-\n| graphed.\n\n“The odd thing is I never met\nhim,” said Dominick Dunne, the\nfamous chronicler of the trials and\ntribulations of the very rich. “I wasn’t\neven aware of him,” except fora\nVanity Fair article.\n\nEpstein’s friendship with Clinton\nhas attracted the most attention.\n\nEpstein met Clinton as early as\n1995, when he paid tens of thou-\nsands of dollars to join him at an\nintimate fund-raising dinner in Palm\nBeach. But from all appearances,\nthey did not become close friends\nuntil after Clinton left the Oval Office\nand moved to New York.\n\nEpstein has donated more than\n$100,000 to Democratic candidates’\ncampaigns, incliding John Kerry’s\npresidential bid, the reelection\ncampaign of New Mexico Gov, Bill\nRichardson and the Senate bids of\nJoe Lieberman, Hillary Rodham\nClinton, Christopher Dodd and\nCharles Schumer.\n\nPowerful friends and enemies\n\nA Vanity Fair profile found\ncracks in the veneer of Epstein’s life\nstory. The 2003 article said he left\nBear Stearns in the wake of a federal\nprobe and a possible Securities and\nExchange Commission violation. It\nalso pointed out that Citibank once\nsued him for defaulting on a $20\nmillion loan.\n\nThe article suggested that one of\nhis business mentors and previous\nemployers was Steven Hoffenberg,\nnow serving a prison term after\n“bilking investors out of more than\n$450 million in one of the largest\nPonzi schemes in American histo-\n\nry. |\n\nAs he amassed his wealth,\nEpstein made enemies in disputes\nboth large and small. He sued the\nman who in 1990 sold him his\nmultimillion-dollar Palm Beach\nhome over a dispute about less than\n$%6,000 in furnishings.\n\n03956-83\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019378",
