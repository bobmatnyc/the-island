It has been shown that the new angle 0 is the previous angle, _ times twice\nthe average distance traveled between collisions called the mean free path, here\nsymbolized by delta, 6, divided by the diameter, D, of the sphere. Algebraically,\n\n0-—0 the new angle is equal to twice the mean free path divided by the diameter\n\nof the spheres times the original directional angle of the sphere’s motion. If we\nsymbolize the time between collisions with tau, 1, after an elapsed time of\n\nexperimental observation, tf, we can say that the deviations from the initial direction\n\nof the sphere changes like (a The exponent, t/, represents the time of the\n\nexperimental observation divided by the average time between collisions of the\nspheres, i.e. the time we’ve been watching, ft, is expressed as units of inter-collision\ninterval, t. Of course, the circular deviation in the angle from the initial direction\nrotates repeatedly around a circle as the number of collisions increase. If a point on\na circle marks the angular change resulting from each collision and the system runs\nlong enough, it has been shown that the circle will eventually be completely covered\n\nby points.\n\nAn estimate of the entropy, S, being generated by each sphere labeled with\nsome index i, Si, is positive because the recurrent motion is deviating continuously\n\nfrom the initial direction. It can be computed for each sphere as the /ogarithm of the\nintercollision time-averaged deviation from the initial direction, S; = “loe(=>) and the\nT\n\nentropy of the whole n hard sphere system is the sum of the n entropies, which can\nbe expressed as nxS;. If we keep books by registering the points when each\nsphere’s makes a stop on the top half of the sphere’s circle as 1 and the bottom\n\nhalf as O (and we must arbitrarily decide between 0 and 1 if it falls exactly on the\n\n104\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013604",
