Nor did she have any way of knowing that when he\nwore another American flag shirt on 7he Merv Griffin Show, his half of the\nTV screen was blocked out all across America. She was, in short, unaware\nof the roots of her own, limited freedom.\n\nkok #\n\nIt’ s Saturday night, and the Carnival Masquerade Ball is being held\nin the huge Convention Center Ballroom. On the wall behind the stage are\ngigantic masks. Above the tables are gold and purple balloons, fashioned\nafter either somebody’ s school colors or a Chinese restaurant’ s little hot\nmustard and soy sauce plate. The taped music is loud, and the dancing is\nraunchy, enhanced by gaudy yellow, blue and red lights. Pheromones are\nflying, and the costumes are kinky.\n\n“Costumes,” the program states, “may be anything of fertile\nimagination (genital area musts be covered) for an exotic night of adult\nsocial fun.” Hey, look who’ s here: Superman. The Phantom of the Opera.\nThe devil. Mickey Mouse and Minnie Mouse (in a see-through top). An\nexecutioner. An Arabian potentate. A gold-plated pharaoh. A chicken lady\ncovered with big yellow feathers. A guy in a dog collar being led around\non a leash. And the one-legged man, who is wearing a roller skate as his\n\ncostume.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015213",
