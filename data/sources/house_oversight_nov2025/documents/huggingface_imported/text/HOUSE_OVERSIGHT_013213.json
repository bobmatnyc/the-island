And, part of the training behavior\nmight be carried out unobserved by the AGI, thus requiring the AGI to infer the omitted parts\nof the task it needs to describe.\n\nAnother popular form of early childhood testing is puzzle block games. These kinds of games\ncan be used to assess a variety of important cognitive skills, and to do so in a fun way that\nnot only examines but also encourages creativity and flexible thinking. Types of games include\npattern matching games in which students replicate patterns described visually or verbally,\npattern creation games in which students create new patterns guided by visually or verbally\ndescribed principles, creative interpretation of patterns in which students find meaning in the\nforms, and free-form creation. Such games may be individual or cooperative.\n\nCross training and assessment of a variety of skills occurs with pattern block games: for\nexample, interpretation of visual or linguistic instructions, logical procedure and pattern fol-\nlowing, categorizing, sorting, general problem solving, creative interpretation, experimentation,\nand kinematic acuity. By making the games cooperative, various interpersonal skills involving\ncommunication and cooperation are also added to the mix.\n\nThe puzzle block context bring up some general observations about the role of kinematic\nand visuospatial intelligence in the AGI Preschool. Outside of robotics and computer vision, AI\nresearch has often downplayed these sorts of intelligence (though, admittedly, this is changing in\nrecent years, e.g. with increasing research focus on diagrammatic reasoning). But these abilities\nare not only necessary to navigate real (or virtual) spatial environments. They are also important\ncomponents of a coherent, conceptually well-formed understanding of the world in which the\nstudent is embodied. Integrative training and assessment of both rigorous cognitive abilities\ngenerally most associated with both AI and “proper schooling” (such as linguistic and logical\nskills) along with kinematic and aesthetic/sensory abilities is essential to the development of\nan intelligence that can successfully both operate in and sensibly communicate about the real\nworld in a roughly humanlike manner. Whether or not an AGI is targeted to interpret physical-\nworld spatial data and perform tasks via robotics, in order to communicate ideas about a vast\narray of topics of interest to any intelligence in this world, an AGI must develop aspects of\nintelligence other than logical and linguistic cognition.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013213",
