  "text": "Deregulation/Gov’t Legislation: There aren’t any clear/obvious changes here that\nwould impact MGM. As a labor intensive business, changes to overtime rules or the\nAffordable Care Act as it relates to company level costs could be modestly beneficial.\n\nTax Policy: MGM will be a cash tax payer in 2017. Tax policy should be mixed. While\nthey get some meaningful interest shield from their decent amount of debt, they also\nhave relatively high capex that could benefit them if expensed as incurred. Import tariffs\nshould be limited in impact as it’s mostly a domestic, services based business with\nlimited COGS.\n\nCatalysts: ConAgg should generate RevPAR tailwinds. RevPAR should accelerate in Q1\nand could be up double digits in the quarter driven by a strong convention calendar,\nheadlined by the ConAgg convention which comes only once every 3 years.\n\nMGM also opened its $1.4B National Harbor casino outside of Washington on December\n8\". The first data points here on revenues will come in early January.\n\nMGM’s Cotai casino in Macau opens in 2Q17 and is a new $3B property. We believe\nexpectations are reasonably low and revenues are still strong in Macau (+ double digits\nin 4Q).

Aside from the ongoing inflection in data, the company should benefit in 2017\nfrom its own structural efficiency program and many potential macro shifts currently\nunder President-elect Trump’s Administration. The new management team (Jim Squires\nwas named CEO in 2015) is working to change the culture and business processes, and\nhas delivered for a few quarters. It set operating targets for the first time in company\nhistory, targeting $650 million in efficiency gains (+25% to 2015 EPS) and a 65%\noperating ratio by 2020. It also set $250 million in efficiency gains and a sub-70%\noperating ratio in 2016, allowing it to immediate progress. In January, management has\nnoted it will further detail its efficiency gain targets, which could be a near-term\ncatalyst for the shares. Under Trump’s proposal’s, NS could benefit from a lower tax\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n10 Top 10 US Ideas Quarterly | 03 January 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014631",
