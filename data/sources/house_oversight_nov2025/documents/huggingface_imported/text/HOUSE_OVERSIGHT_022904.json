Whereas, I could go—TI mean I\ndon’t look that great now—but I could go from being\nseen as a figure of some probity and some intelligence\nto being a figure of much less intelligence and much less\nprobity...”\n\n“Well,” says Pierce in seeming dramatic\nunderstatement, “you are going to have some low\nquality characters playing early in the space...”\n\nThat evening, in the Epstein dining room (he seems\nrarely to use the rest of the house’s 50,000 square feet),\nthere is a small cocktail party, which includes the former\nPrime Minister of Australian, Kevin Rudd, and\nThorbjorn Jagland, the head of the Nobel Peace Prize\nCommittee, who offers an affable, but generally\nscathing, critique of U.S. diplomacy (and a brief defense\nof Obama’s Peace Prize award) and to whom Epstein\noffers a ride back to Europe on his jet.\n\nThe next morning, it’s Ehud Barack, the former\nIsraeli Prime Minister, for breakfast. Barack is, over his\nomelet, able to defend both Obama and Putin. Then a\nhigh ranking official from the Obama White House,\nwhose name I am asked not to use. There follows the\nformer head of the UN Security Council, Hardeep Purie,\nand then head of the central bank of Kazakhstan, Kairat\nKelimbetov. Then Nathan Myhrvold the former chief\ntechnology office at Microsoft. Then Martin Nowak, a\nProfessor of Biology and Mathematics and Director of\nthe Program for Evolutionary Dynamics at Harvard, the\ninstitute that Epstein has funded with $30 million.
