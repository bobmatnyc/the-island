  "text": "keep private.\n\ne » Establish do-not-disturb hours, when calls are routed directly to\nvoicemail with no ring.\n\ne » Have voicemail sent to your cell phone as SMS (text messages).\n\nYouMail, another option, can also transcribe voicemails and send them to your phone as text\nmessages. Getting calls while stuck in a time-wasting meeting’? No problem: Respond to voicemails via\nSMS during the meeting so you’re not stuck returning calls afterward.\n\nOne Shot, One Kill Scheduling Without E-mail Back-and-Forth\n\nFew things are as time-consuming as scheduling via e-mail. Person A: “How about Tues. at 3 PM.?”\nPerson B: “I can make it.” Person C: “I have a meeting. How about Thurs.?” Person D: “I’m on a con-\ncall. How about 10 A.M. on Fri.?” Use these tools to make scheduling simple and fast instead of another\npart-time job.\n\n= Doodle ( www.doodle.com )\n\nThe best free tool ’ve found for herding cats (multiple people) for scheduling without excessive e-mail.\nCreate and poll in 30 seconds with the proposed options and forward a link to everyone invited. Check\nback a few hours later and you’ll have the best time for the most people.\n\n= TimeDriver ( www.timedriver.com )\n\nLet colleagues and clients self-schedule with you based on your availability, which is determined by\nintegration with Outlook or Google Calendar. Embed a “schedule now” button in e-mail messages and\nyou'll never have to tell people when you can make a call or meeting. Let them see what’s open and\nchoose.\n\nChoosing the Best E-mail Batching Times\n\n= Xobni ( www.xobni.com/special )\n\nXobni—inbox spelled backwards—is a free program for putting Outlook on steroids. It offers many\nfeatures, but the most relevant to this chapter is its ability to identify “hotspots,” or periods of time when\nyou receive the bulk of e-mail from your most important contacts. These “hotspots” are batching times\nthat will enable you to keep critical contacts (clients, bosses, etc.) smiling even while you reduce\nchecking e-mail to 1-3 times per day. It will also populate your contacts automatically by pulling phone\nnumbers, addresses, etc., from separate e-mail buried in the inbox.\n\nE-mailing Without Entering the Black Hole of the Inbox\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013867",
