And in -- in your answer a couple of\nquestions --\n\nA. 1I--I'msorry. I shouldn't say \"destroyed.\"\nThey have been able to conceal would probably be a more\naccurate term, the -- the evidence that we are trying to\ngather.\n\nQ. In my answer -- in my answer --\n\nA. Yeah.\n\nQ.  -- in the question and answer, your answer to\nmy question a couple of questions ago, you talked about\nwhether Mr. Epstein and Virginia Roberts would have the\nsame or equal ability to disclose --\n\nA. Right.\n\nQ. -- what these prominent politicians,\net cetera, had done, correct?\n\nA. Correct.\n\nQ. Without attempting to make any comparison,\nyou would agree, would you not, that as of December\n30th, 2014, Miss Roberts had the ability to name the\nnames of the people who are referenced in this document?\n\nA. Physical ability, yes.\n\nQ. And -- well, let me ask this: You say a\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n\nwell-known prime minister. Is that Prime Minister\nBarak?\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: I'm gonna instruct you not to\nreveal any attorney/client communications you had\nwith Virginia Roberts on the specifics of her\ncounsel to you about these individuals.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Is one of the other -- one of the powerful\nbusiness executives, Les Wexner?\n\nMS. McCAWLEY: Again, same instruction.\n\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. Okay. Now, you mentioned yesterday -- well,\na moment ago, you testified that these -- in your view,\nthese allegations about other powerful men furthered\nMiss Roberts’ legal position in the case, correct?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. And it's also your position, I assume, that\nthe allegations regarding Professor Dershowitz and\nPrince Andrew furthered Miss Roberts' legal position; is\nthat right?\n\nA. Absolutely.\n\nQ. Does the fact that Judge Marra struck those\nallegations as impertinent, scandalous, and completely\nirrelevant to the case, cause you to reassess?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: Excuse me.

SIMPSON: Back up.\nBY MR. SIMPSON:\n\nQ. What is your understanding of Judge Marra's\nruling with respect to these allegations about Professor\nDershowitz and Prince Andrew?\n\nA. That they were premature.\n\nQ. That's your understanding of his order?\n\nA. Yes.\n\nQ. Okay.\n\nA. And I-- maybe I should -- I see some\nskepticism there, so let me explain why I think those\nallegations --\n\nQ. Yeah. Well, we can pull -~\n\nA. -- are appropriate.\n\nQ. ~~ we will pull out the order itself --\n\nA. Sure.\n\nQ. _-- at the appropriate time, but first, your\nunderstanding is that the judge didn't find that those\nallegations, at the time they were made, were so\nirrelevant to the case, that they should be stricken\nfrom the public record?\n\nA. Inthat pleading at that time, remember, we\nhad in our -- our brief -- let me explain the -- the\nnine reasons why we thought that those allegations were\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n(954) 331-4400\n299\nrelevant to the case, since I think your question calls\nfor that.\n\nQ. Are those the nine reasons you gave\nyesterday?\n\nA. No, I didn't have a chance to.\n\nQ. Are they the nine reasons that are set forth\nin your -- in your brief?\n\nA. They are. Those are the nine reasons that\nare set forth in the brief.\n\nQ. Okay. And -- and Judge Marra had that brief\nin front of him when he held that, these allegations\nwere so not relevant to the issues before the court,\nthat they would be stricken and not part of the public\nrecord?\n\nA. At that time, in that particular pleading --\n\nI think you're mischaracterizing Judge Marra's ruling in\nits entirety, He specifically said that the allegations\ncould be reasserted, if they were relevant to issues\nthat are -- that were coming up. And so, in following\nthat ruling, we went to the U.S, Attorney's Office,\npropounded discovery requests and said, look, we believe\nyou're sitting on information that Dershowitz was, you\nknow, connected with the -- with the criminal\ntrafficking here; we would like you to produce those\ndocuments.\n\nESQUIRE DEPOSITION SOLUTIONS\n\n(954) 331-4400\n\n10/20/2015 01:08:15 PM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_010877",
