  "text": "Guiding Principles\nof Enforcement\n\nand reference checks; ensuring that the contract spells out exactly what services and deliverables (such as written status\nreports or other documentation) Consultant is providing; training Consultant on the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws;\nrequiring Consultant to represent that he will abide by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws; including audit rights in the\ncontract (and exercising those rights); and ensuring that payments requested by Consultant have the proper supporting\ndocumentation before they are approved for payment.\n\nPart 2: Distributors and Local Partners\n\nAssume the following alternative facts:\n\nInstead of hiring Consultant, Company A retains an often-used local distributor (Distributor) to sell Company A's\nproducts to the Ministry of Immigration. In negotiating the pricing structure, Distributor, which had introduced the project\nto Company A, claims that the standard discount price to Distributor creates insufficient margin for Distributor to cover\nwarehousing, distribution, installation, marketing, and training costs and requests an additional discount or rebate, or, in\nthe alternative, a contribution to its marketing efforts, either in the form of a lump sum or as a percentage of the total\ncontract. The requested discount/allowance is significantly larger than usual, although there is precedent at Company\nA for granting this level of discount in unique circumstances. Distributor further advises Company A that the Ministry's\nprocurement officials responsible for awarding the contract have expressed a strong preference for including a particular\nlocal company (Local Partner) in the transaction as a subcontractor of Company A to perform installation, training, and\nother services that would normally have been performed by Distributor or Company A. According to Distributor, the\nMinistry has a solid working relationship with Local Partner, and it would cause less disruption for Local Partner to perform\nmost of the on-site work at the Ministry. One of the principals (Principal 1) of the Local Partner is an official in another\n\ngovernment ministry.\n\nWhat additional compliance considerations do these alternative facts raise?\n\nAs with Consultant in the first scenario above, Company A should carefully vet Distributor and Local Partner and their\nroles in the transaction in order to minimize the likelihood of incurring FCPA liability. While Company A has an established\nrelationship with Distributor, the fact that Distributor has requested an additional discount warrants further inquiry into\nthe economic justification for the change, particularly where, as here, the proposed transaction structure contemplates\npaying Local Partner to provide many of the same services that Distributor would otherwise provide. In many cases, it may\nbe appropriate for distributors to receive larger discounts to account for unique circumstances in particular transactions.\nThat said, a common mechanism to create additional margin for bribe payments is through excessive discounts or rebates\nto distributors. Accordingly, when a company has pre-existing relationships with distributors and other third parties,\ntransaction-specific due diligence—including an analysis of payment terms to confirm that the payment is commensurate\nwith the work being performed—can be critical even in circumstances where due diligence of the distributor or other third\nparty raises no initial red flags.\n\nCompany A should carefully scrutinize the relationship among Local Partner, Distributor, and Ministry of Immigration\nofficials. While there is nothing inherently illegal about contracting with a third party that is recommended by the end-user,\nor even hiring a government official to perform legitimate services on a transaction unrelated to his or her government\njob, these facts raise additional red flags that warrant significant scrutiny. Among other things, Company A would be\nwell-advised to require Principal 1 to verify that he will have no role in the Ministry of Immigration’s decision to award\nthe contract to Company A, notify the Ministry of Immigration and his own ministry of his proposed involvement in the\ntransaction, and certify that he will abide by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and that his involvement in the\ntransaction is permitted under local law.\n\n(cont’d)\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022566",
