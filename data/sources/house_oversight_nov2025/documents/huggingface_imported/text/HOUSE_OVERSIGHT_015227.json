  "text": "My friend Roy Zimmerman, who writes and sings satirical folk songs\nin the tradition of Tom Lehrer, has a spoken piece of patter which goes: “I\njust got back from the conspiracy convention. Have you been? It’ s fun.\nSeven hundred conspiracy theorists all in one hotel, with the little name\ntags, ‘Hello, my name is—none of your fucking business!’ Great\nseminars— ‘Triangulation and You, ‘Paranoia for Profit,’ ‘Victoria’ s\nReal Secret Was J. Edgar Hoover.’ In the lobby, | saw five people get off\nthe elevator—what, you think that’ s a coincidence? There was\nentertainment, of course—a group of horny anti-government folk singers\ncalled the Randy Weavers.”\n\nZimmerman was surprised to learn that there would actually be an\nevent such as the one that he thought he was making up. Although the\nreal conspiracy convention didn’ t have the seven hundred attendees he\nhad imagined, there were over 500, including 40% from out of state and\n10% from other countries, including Canada, England, Australia, Denmark,\nAustria and Ireland. Also taking place at the Santa Clara Convention Center\nthat same weekend as Conspiracy Con was the Charismatic Catholic\n\nConvention. Dueling religions, together again.\n\nzk k *\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015227",
