  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nMoshe Katsav\n\nPresident Moshe Katsav of Israel asked me to come to see him during the last year of his\npresidency. He asked me for advice—political and media advice rather than legal, since I am not\nan expert on Israeli law—about the sexual harassment charges he was then facing. He told me\nthat he had been offered a deal by the prosecutor under which he would plead guilty to an\nharassment charge, and the prosecutor would not bring rape charges. I do not feel comfortable\ndisclosing precisely the advice I gave him, even though it wasn’t legal advice and even though I\nwas never part of his legal team. All I can say is that if he had followed my advice, I don’t think\nhe would be in prison today.\n\n379\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017466",
