Lenny laughed one loud staccato “Ha” and\nkissed me on the forehead.\n\nWe developed a friendship integrated with stand-up comedy. In_ his\nact Lenny had broken through traditional stereotypical jokes about\nairplane food, nagging wives, Chinese drivers, annoying mothers-in-law.\nInstead he weaved his taboo-breaking targets--teachers' low salaries\nversus show-business celebs, religious leaders’ hypocrisy, cruel abortion\nlaws, racial injustice, the double standard between illegal and prescription\ndrugs--into stream-of-consciousness vignettes.\n\nIn each succeeding performance, he would sculpt and re-sculpt his\nconcept into a theatrical context, experimenting from show to show like a\nverbal jazz musician. Audience laughter would sometimes turn into\nclapping for the creative process itself. “Please don't applaud,” he’ d\n\nrequest. “It breaks my rhythm.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030188",
