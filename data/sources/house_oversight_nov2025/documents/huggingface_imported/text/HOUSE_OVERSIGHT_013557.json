  "text": "remain the same after perturbation? Note that the inter-data point metric distances\nare not considered. If they do, the two dynamical objects being compared are\ntopologically equivalent. The test of this equivalence requires the mapping one set\nonto the other with, at most, smooth distortions of either or both surfaces.\n\nIn the context of catastrophe-related bifurcation theory, if a 5 converts a\nsteady valued fixed point to an oscillating cycle on a manifold of potential actions,\nalso called a state space, then the fixed point system was not structurally stable. In\nphase space, this is seen as a change-in-causal-parameter induced transformation\nof a dot to a circle. If the one frequency circle is perturbed to a manifold of the\nsystem’s actions consisting of two independent frequencies, the circle takes the\ntopological form of the crust of a doughnut, one frequency graphed spiral winding\naround the doughnut, the other winding along the doughnut around its orifice, the\ncircle is not structurally stable. If 5 distorts the frequency-amplitude relations on a\nsurface such that the manifold of possible actions is distorted from a doughnut to a\ntea cup, both topological manifolds being one holed surfaces and therefore\ntopologically equivalent, the system is structurally stable. Perturbed systems that\nmaintain the sequence of points in time in sequential order (though the distances\nbetween the points may be different), are generally structurally stable.\n\nThe seductive possibility, one which Thom realized so successfully, was\nthat in the language of distance-independent differential topological forms, there\nwould exist a small, finite set of shapes categorically describing the causes and\nresult parameter spaces from which, even without specific quantities, universal\nqualitative (including discontinuous) behavior could be described and sometimes\npredicted. A formal yet general categorical system within which a small set of\nuniversal discontinuous changes in global qualities could be rationalized seemed\nseductively applicable to the enlightenment transitions, spiritual transformations,\nappearing suddenly after months and years of disciplined spiritual practice. The\nPlatonic view is that the universal forms of discontinuous change existed before\nthey could be about anything specific, before the universe was born.\n\nIn this era of nonlinear dynamics and dynamical system, common dynamical\n\nscenarios give accounts of smooth changes in causes leading to discontinuous\n\n57\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013557",
