Mr. Abe's government has continued to \npush for a restart of the country's nuclear power program, and he heads to the Middle East on Saturday to promote \nJapanese exports to the region, including nuclear technology. \nMr. Abe also plans to lead Tokyo's delegation to Argentina for the International Olympic Committee's final vote, set for Sept. \n7, on the host city for the 2020 Olympics. Tokyo, 150 miles south of the stricken nuclear power plant, is one of three finalists \ncompeting to host the games. The others are Istanbul and Madrid. \nOpposition lawmakers here have demanded that Mr. Abe stay home and declare a state of emergency. \n\"The nuclear crisis is real and ongoing, yet the government continues to look the other way,\" said Yoshiko Kira of the \nopposition Japan Communist Party, which made significant gains in parliamentary elections last month. \n\"The government should declare a state of emergency right now, and intervene to stop the outflow of contaminated water,\" \nMs. Kira said at an anti-nuclear rally outside Mr. Abe's office in Tokyo. \nMr. Abe remains popular, and it is uncertain how large a liability the crisis at the Fukushima plant will become for him. \nBut it has become increasingly clear that the latest problems may be too large for the plant's operator, the Tokyo Electric \nPower Company, or Tepco, to handle. \nTepco has built nearly 1,000 tanks at the sprawling complex to store as many as 335,000 tons of contaminated water, the \nproduct of coolant pumped into the reactors to keep their cores from overheating, and groundwater pouring into their \nbreached basements at a rate of 400 tons a day. This week, Tepco said one tank had sprung a huge leak. \nOn Friday, Tepco presented an even starker view of the situation, acknowledging that as much as 220,000 tons of that water \nis stored in makeshift steel tanks similar to the one that is leaking. The operator said the 36-foot-tall cylindrical tanks, meant \nas a temporary repository for the growing amount of radiated water at the complex, used vulnerable rubber sealing and that \ntheir ability to withstand radiation was not tested. \nThe tanks are susceptible to leaks at the seams and through their concrete base, said Noriyuki Imaizumi, the acting general \nmanager of Tepco's nuclear power division. A nearby drain can carry any leaked water to the sea, Mr. Imaizumi said, and \nhigh radiation readings along a section suggest that water has already traveled through the drain to the ocean. \nThe makeshift tanks also lack water level gauges, making it difficult to detect leaks. Only two workers are assigned to \nchecking nearly 1,000 tanks on two-hour patrols twice a day, Mr. Imaizumi said. \nThe Nuclear Regulation Authority, which the Japanese government ordered to more actively advise and monitor Tepco's \nactivities at the plant, had told the company to begin transferring the water from the makeshift tanks to better-built vessels. \nBut after visiting the plant on Friday, an authority commissioner, Toyoshi Fuketa, said the vast quantities made doing so \nquickly \"unrealistic.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028623 \nA series of pits Tepco dug to store some of the water also began leaking earlier this year, forcing workers to transfer the \nwater into the steel tanks. \nExperts have said they suspect that more contaminated water is seeping out from under the melted-down reactors into the \ngroundwater and the Pacific. Elevated levels of radioactive cesium in surrounding waters seem to confirm those suspicions. \nTepco has said those leaks are not directly from beneath the reactors, but from maintenance tunnels that run along the coast \nand remain contaminated from the early days of the disaster. \nBut it also acknowledges that the water beneath the reactors is extremely contaminated, and experts say that if it does get \ninto the ocean, it will surpass even the leaks that occurred in the disaster's early days. \n\"That prospect scares me,\" Michio Aoyama, a senior scientist in the Oceanography and Geochemistry Research \nDepartment at the government-affiliated Meteorological Research Institute, said in an interview this month. \n\"It's the ultimate, worst-case scenario,\" Professor Aoyama said. \nBack to top  \nThe New Nuclear Craze  \nMark Bittman - New York Times \nThere is a new discussion about nuclear energy, prompted by well-founded concerns about carbon emissions and fueled by \na pro-nuclear documentary called \"Pandora's Promise.\" Add a statement by James E. Hansen — who famously sounded \nthe alarm on climate change — and, of course, industry propaganda, and presto: We Love Nukes. \nBefore we all become pro-nuclear greens, however, you've got to ask three questions: Is nuclear power safe and clean? Is it \neconomical? And are there better alternatives? \nNo, no and yes. So let's not swap the pending environmental disaster of climate change for another that may be equally \nrisky. \nDespite all-out efforts and international cooperation, Fukushima, which scared Germany right out of the nuclear power \nbusiness, still isn't under control. Proponents of nuclear power promise new and safer technology, but these discussions \nare filled with \"coulds\"; no such plants exist. Nor would they reduce the risks of proliferation. (Oh, that little thing.) \nNor would they do much to mitigate the all-too-infrequently discussed dangers of uranium mining, which uses vast amounts \nof water in the West — an area that can ill afford it— and is barely regulated or even studied. Thousands of uranium mines \nhave been abandoned, and no one seems to know how many remain to be cleaned up. The cost of that cleanup, of course, \nwill be borne by taxpayers, not industry. \nThen there's disposal of spent fuel, which is not contained at the same safety level as active fuel, itself a scary thought. \nDecades into the nuclear age there remains, incredibly, no real plan for this; a patchwork scheme by the Nuclear Regulatory \nCommission, which appears to be even more industry-friendly than most federal agencies, was rejected by an appeals court \nlast year, and the Obama administration is standing by its campaign promise (shocking, I know) to abandon the nuclear \nrepository at Yucca Mountain in Nevada. \nThe economic viability of nuclear power is no more encouraging. Plants continue to close and generation rates continue to \ndrop. Operators may indeed continue to make money on reactors, but that's only because federal subsidies are enormous. \nInsurance costs are limited. Loans are guaranteed (the Solyndra loan guarantee was half a billion dollars; in contrast, loan \nguarantees for new nuclear plants may run $8 billion); cost recovery and return on investment are also assured for decades, \nand some operators are able to collect costs from ratepayers (and pay dividends to shareholders) years before plants come \nonline — even if they never come online. \nSo they're economical as long as you're the owner, because historically, subsidies for nuclear power have been more than \ndouble the expense of power generation itself. While estimates of the costs of power generation vary wildly — allowing both \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028624 \nproponents and detractors of any given power technology to make their cases — few of them take externalities (costs to the \nenvironment or to public health, for example) into account. And nuclear power's externalities could exceed those for any \nother form of power generation except coal. \nThat's why we're reducing coal usage — if we had a strong climate policy it would be gone in a couple of deades, and \nnuclear should be right behind it. It's likely that no new nuclear plants will be built before true renewables are able to take the \nplace of scary, highly damaging energy sources. \nWhich brings us full circle: the new proponents of nuclear power say that since nuclear power is arguably preferable to coal, \nmaybe we should subsidize the building of new plants. \nIf those were the only options, maybe that argument would be a sound one. But they're not. Energy efficiency (remember \nthat?), natural gas (imperfect, yes, but improvable) and wind are all cheaper. Even solar is already less expensive than \nnuclear power in good locations. \nSome studies show that renewables can generate 80 percent of our electricity in 2050, using current technologies, while \nreducing carbon emissions from the electric sector by 80 percent. Climate change fears should be driving not old and \ndisproven technologies but renewable ones, which are more practical. These technologies remain relatively small — non-\nhydro renewables were around 5 percent of the total last year— but they're growing so fast (wind and solar use have \nquadrupled in the last five years) that just this week the chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission predicted \nthat solar power could soon begin to double every two years. \nUtilities are afraid that solar power will be to the electrical grid what PCs were to mainframes, or e-mail to the Postal Service: \na technology that will simply kill its predecessors. Coal and nuclear power are both doomed, and the profit-making power \ngrid with it. That's all to our benefit. \nBack to top \nPipeline-Capacity Squeeze Reroutes Crude Oil \nRussell Gold —Wall Street Journal \nMore crude oil is moving around the U.S. on trucks, barges and trains than at any point since the government began keeping \nrecords in 1981, as the energy industry devises ways to get around a pipeline-capacity shortage to take petroleum from new \nwells to refineries. \nThe improvised approach is creating opportunities for transportation companies even as it strains roads and regulators. And \nit is a precursor to what may be a larger change: the construction of more than $40 billion in oil pipelines now under way or \nplanned for the next few years, according to energy adviser Wood Mackenzie. \n\"We are in effect re-plumbing the country,\" says Curt Anastasio, chief executive of NuStar Energy LP, NS +0.58% a pipeline \ncompany in San Antonio. Oil is \"flowing in different directions and from new places.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028625 \nU.S. oil production has reached its highest level in two decades, while imports have fallen dramatically. A system built to \nimport oil and deliver it to coastal refineries has become ill-equipped to handle rising production in Texas, North Dakota and \nCanada's Alberta province. \n\"All of the pipes are pointed in the wrong direction,\" says Harold York, an oil researcher at Wood Mackenzie. \"We are turning \nthe last 70 years of oil-industry history in North America on its head, and we are turning it on its head in the next 10 to 15 \nyears.\" \nWith oil prices persistently above $100 a barrel, companies drilling new wells don't want to forgo revenue while they wait \nyears for new pipelines. That leaves them with trucks, trains and barges to move an increasing amount of crude. \nOil delivered to refineries by trucks grew 38% from 2011 to 2012, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, \nwhile crude on barges grew 53% and rail deliveries quadrupled. Although alternatives are growing rapidly, pipelines and \noceangoing tankers remain the primary method for delivering crude to refineries. \nIn the Eagle Ford, a large four-year-old South Texas oil field, production has grown to more than 500,000 barrels a day, from \nless than 1,000 in 2009, according to state statistics. Getting that torrent out of the sparsely populated region has required \nmodifications to the oil-delivery system. \nFor example, last year NuStar reversed a 16-inch pipeline built to carry crude imported from Africa and Europe northward \nfrom the Port of Corpus Christi. Now, the pipeline flows south, taking delivery from hundreds of trucks that fill up at individual \nwells. Some of the 175,000 barrels a day moving through the pipe is loaded onto barges at Corpus Christi and towed toward \nrefineries near Houston. \nEarlier this year, Phillips 66 began putting some of this crude on ships for a 2,200-mile journey around Florida to its refinery \nin Linden, N.J. \nThe heavy trucks moving Eagle Ford crude are causing headaches for residents and local officials, ripping up roads and \ncausing traffic tie-ups. \n\"These are rural roads built for 10 cars an hour, and now it's 100 vehicles an hour, and 75 of them are 80,000-pound trucks,\" \nsays Tom Voelkel, president of Dupre Logistics LLC. The Lafayette, La., company started hauling crude in Eagle Ford in \nNovember 2011 and has more than 100 drivers full time in the region. \nThe Texas Legislature appropriated $450 million this year to repair and improve roads in oil-producing counties. \"It doesn't \neven begin to reach where it needs to reach,\" says Daryl Fowler, the chief elected county official in Cuero, Texas, about a \nhundred miles southeast of San Antonio. \n\"We've seen a fourfold increase in congestion around here,\" he says. \"The roads are crumbling.\" \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028626 \nIn July, the Texas transportation department decided to convert 83 miles of state road in six oil-boom counties from \npavement to gravel, to reduce repair costs and slow traffic. \nTrucks filled with Eagle Ford crude are also heading 100 miles west to a barge canal. The first barge of crude departed in \nSeptember 2011, heading south toward the Gulf of Mexico and refineries near Houston. Now the canal moves 1.6 million \nbarrels a month, says Jennifer Stastny, executive director of the Port of Victoria. \n\"It's like putting your 5-year-old to bed one night and he wakes up the next morning as a 16-year-old, with the appetite and \ndemands of a 16-year-old,\" she says. \nIn North Dakota, trains move 69% of the state's 800,000 barrels a day of crude, according to state figures. Energy \ncompanies say they value rail's ability to deliver crude to the highest-paying markets. \nBut the deadly runaway crude train crash in Canada's Quebec province in July, which incinerated a small town and killed at \nleast 47 people, highlighted the risks of the mile-long crude trains crisscrossing the country. The U.S. government is \nimposing new regulations on oil shipments by rail. \nSome state regulators wonder if their local efforts leave them prepared for a train accident, in part because federal railroad \nrules pre-empt state and local control over trains. \nIn Washington state, \"we can't say [to train operators] you have to have oil-spill contingency plans in order to operate,\" says \nCurt Hart, a spokesman for the state's Department of Ecology. \"We do that for oil tankers, barges, large commercial vessels \nand refineries.\" \nHome to five refineries, the state levies a per-barrel tax on crude delivered by tankers and barges, which pays for spill-\nresponse officials and inspectors. The tax doesn't apply to rail shipments. \nThe American Association of Railroads says it is prepared for growing crude shipments because it has long carried \nhazardous cargoes. In 2008, major U.S. railroads carried 9,500 carloads of crude, the association says, and are on pace this \nyear to carry 389,000. \nMost industry analysts believe that while crude on trains will last, truck and barge traffic will decline once new pipelines \ncome into service. \nEnvironmental groups have criticized some pipeline projects, including the Keystone XL, meant to move Canadian oil to \nGulf Coast refineries. The federal government is still studying the Keystone pipeline and has yet to issue needed permits. \nSteve Kean, president and chief operating officer of Kinder Morgan Inc., KM! +0.30% one of several interrelated companies \nthat own or operate 82,000 miles of North American pipeline, says government agencies thoroughly vet new projects. \nFalling imports, infrastructure investments and increased manufacturing are just some of the benefits of newly abundant \nenergy supplies, he says. \"This has got to be one of the best things that has happened in our economy in the past 10 years. \nIt is better than the iPad.\" \nBack to top \nU.S. Electrical Grid on the Edge of Failure \nJeff Tollefson — Nature \nFacebook can lose a few users and remain a perfectly stable network, but where the national grid is concerned simple \ngeography dictates that it is always just a few transmission lines from collapse. \nThat is according to a mathematical study of spatial networks by physicists in Israel and the United States. Study co-author \nShlomo Havlin of Bar-Ilan University in Ramat-Gan, Israel, says that the research builds on earlier work by incorporating a \nmore explicit analysis of how the spatial nature of physical networks affects their fundamental stability. The upshot, \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028627 \npublished today in Nature Physics, is that spatial networks are necessarily dependent on any number of critical nodes \nwhose failure can lead to abrupt— and unpredictable — collapsel \nThe electric grid, which operates as a series of networks that are defined by geography, is a prime example, says Havlin. \n\"Whenever you have such dependencies in the system, failure in one place leads to failure in another place, which \ncascades into collapse.\" \nThe warning comes ten years after a blackout that crippled parts of the midwest and northeastern United States and parts of \nCanada. In that case, a series of errors resulted in the loss of three transmission lines in Ohio over the course of about an \nhour. Once the third line went down, the outage cascaded towards the coast, cutting power to some 50 million people. \nHavlin says that this outage is an example of the inherent instability his study describes, but others question whether the \nteam's conclusions can really be extrapolated to the real world. \n\"I suppose I should be open-minded to new research, but I'm not convinced,\" says Jeff Dagle, an electrical engineer at the \nPacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland, Washington, who served on the government task force that investigated \nthe 2003 outage. \"The problem is that this doesn't reflect the physics of how the power grid operates.\" \nCritical order \nHavlin and his colleagues focused on idealized scenarios. They found that randomly structured networks — such as social \nnetworks — degrade slowly as nodes are removed, which in the real world might mean there is time to diagnose and \naddress a problem before a system collapses. By contrast, the connections of orderly lattice structures have more critical \nnodes, which increase the instability. The problem is that such orderly networks are always operating near an indefinable \nedge, Havlin says. To reduce that risk, he recommends adding a small number of longer transmission lines that provide \nshort cuts to different parts of the grid. \nBenjamin Carreras, a physicist at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in Tennessee who has conducted similar work2, says that \nnetwork theory can be useful for providing insight into electric grids but must be complemented with more complex models \nthat attempt to represent both the physical realities and the responsiveness of the modern electric grid. Although in some \ncases adding long lines can benefit the overall stability of an electric system, Carreras' work suggests that in certain \ncircumstances such an approach allows problems to propagate even farther. \n\"More connections may stabilize some processes, by, for instance, increasing the number of paths to generators, but also \nmay destabilize others,\" Carreras says. \"One cannot make generic statements on this topic.\" \nAlthough local outages caused by falling trees knocking down distribution lines are common, large-scale failures within the \ncore ne transmission lines rarely occur on a modern electric grid. Before 2003, the last major blackout in the United States \nhad been on the west coast in 1996, and more recently an outage has struck in the San Diego area. \nDagle says that the 2003 blackout stemmed from a combination of bad vegetation management — the first three lines \ntripped after sagging into trees but were all within their load rating — and a series of monitoring and communications \nbreakdowns. Vegetation requirements have since been standardized, and a new generation of sensors is providing grid \noperators with more information about what is happening across the grid at any given moment. \n\"Many more utilities have much more data,\" Dagle says. \"The next phase of our voyage is to make better use of that data.\" \nBack to top  \nTechnology — Full text articles \nBallmer Departure From Microsoft Was More Sudden Than Portrayed by the Company \nKara Swisher —All Things D \nAccording to sources close to the situation, the departure of CEO Steve Ballmer from Microsoft last week was more sudden \nthan was depicted by the company in its announcement that he would be retiring within the next year in a planned smooth \ntransition. \nIt was neither planned nor as smooth as portrayed. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028628 \nWhile the decision to go seems to have technically been Ballmer's, interviews with dozens of people inside and outside the \ncompany, including many close to the situation, indicate that he had not aimed to leave this soon and especially after the \nrecent restructuring of the company that he had intensely planned. \nInstead, sources said Ballmer's timeline had been moved up drastically — first by him and then the nine-member board, \nincluding his longtime partner and Microsoft co-founder and chairman Bill Gates — after all agreed that it was best if he left \nsooner than later. \nThat was due to a number of increasingly problematic issues on the immediate horizon — including a potentially nasty proxy \nfight, continued business performance declines and, perhaps most of all, that Ballmer's leadership was becoming a very \nobvious lightning rod. \nInterestingly, Ballmer actually indicated that he had planned on staying in his letter about his impending departure, noting: \n\"My original thoughts on timing would have had my retirement happen in the middle of our transformation to a devices and \nservices company focused on empowering customers in the activities they value most.\" \nThat sentence spurred much chatter inside the company, including the persistent rumor that Gates had dropped the bomb \non Ballmer. That sentiment was further underscored when Ballmer's letter contained no reference or thanks to Gates, with \nwhom he has been tightly tethered over the last several decades. Its absence has been much discussed internally at \nMicrosoft, where it has been seen as an unusual slight and a sign of a rift. \nGates also did not reference his longtime business partner in any celebratory manner in Microsoft's announcement. \"As a \nmember of the succession planning committee, I'll work closely with the other members of the board to identify a great new \nCEO,\" said Gates, in the entirety of the quote about Ballmer's retirement. \"We're fortunate to have Steve in his role until the \nnew CEO assumes these duties.\" \nOther sources cautioned that it was not indicative of tensions between the pair, but was done to minimize \"lame duck \nconcerns\" that might arise if Ballmer was portrayed as already out the door. \nThose sources also insist that Gates never asked Ballmer to step down sooner, although they acknowledge that he also did \nnot — as Gates had in the past — disagree that it was best that he move on. \n\"Did Gates instigate it? No,\" said one source with knowledge of the situation. \"But was he as supportive of Ballmer as he had \nbeen in the past? Maybe not.\" \nThat was still a big change, of course. Gates — who has always been and remains the key decision-maker on Microsoft's \nboard — had always been Ballmer's major backer, despite increasing pressure both externally and from other directors for \nhim to step down. \nGates had rejected such suggestions for years. That included former director and Netflix CEO Reed Hastings, who many \nsources said had been one of the first to urge that the company replace Ballmer as CEO, as well as from a spate of Wall \nStreet investors complaining about the company's declining value in the Ballmer years. \nAs AllThingsD's John Paczkowski wrote on Friday: \"Here's one metric by which Ballmer will be judged harshly. On the last \nday of 1999, the day before he took over as CEO, Microsoft's market capitalization was $600 billion. On the day before he \nannounced his intention to retire, it was less than $270 billion.\" \nThat's a damning number, of course, coupled with a widespread sentiment that Ballmer had missed critical trends in tech \nunder his tenure. Despite a strong growth in revenue, investors and others had long concluded that Microsoft had thrived \nwhen Gates was CEO and waned under Ballmer's rule. \nStill, until recently, there has been no signal from the company indicating any change in top leadership. In fact, the \nmanagement reorganization backed strongly by the board a month ago had essentially placed Ballmer at the center of the \nstructure under a plan described as \"One Microsoft.\" \nAnd, at the time of the restructuring announcement in July, Ballmer's definite and clear message was that he was there to \nstay: \n\"Lots of change. But in all of this, many key things remains the same. Our incredible people, our spirit, our commitment, our \nbelief in the transformative power of technology — our Microsoft technology — to make the world a better place for billions \nof people and millions of businesses around the world. It's why I come to work inspired every day. It's why we've evolved \nbefore, and why we're evolving now. Because we're not done. Let's go.\" \nThough early in its rollout, the changes have been jarring and created a level of chaos at the company that has led to much \ngrumbling internally. It also did not help that the restructuring was quickly followed by a dismal 04 performance by Microsoft. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028629 \nAs I wrote in mid-July: \"Microsoft had a bad fourth quarter, mostly because many people are not using PCs any more. In \naddition, the tech giant took a $900 million charge related to having to cut the price of its Surface RT tablet, which had — as \nyou might imagine — an impact on results. Missed profit expectations, missed revenue, missed all over the ying-yang.\" \nWith the prospect that the next quarter could be weaker still and with numerous reports of late that there has been slowing of \nadoption from its new flagship Windows 8 offering, Ballmer and the board finally aligned to move his departure date sooner. \nMost critical to that decision, source said, were increased board worries that recent pressure from activist investor ValueAct \n— which has a large stake in the company — had a good chance of succeeding in its efforts to obtain a seat on the board of \nMicrosoft, especially if Ballmer stayed in place. \nAnd even if the software giant was able to thwart that from happening, said several sources, such a public fight is untenable \nfor the company, since it was likely to attract even more scrutiny to Ballmer's performance and perhaps even more investor \naction \nValueAct has until August 30 to notify Microsoft if it plans a proxy battle, and sources said it still wants more that Ballmer's \nretirement. In talks, said sources, it has asked for an aggressive stock buyback and also a dividend increase, which might \nassuage its efforts to garner a board seat. \nBallmer denied any pressure from ValueAct specifically in his decision in an interview with the Seattle Times, though \nsources said that was simply bluster. \nAnd, even with mounting pressure on him, Ballmer definitely portrayed the change as his decision in an interview he gave to \nZDNet's Mary Jo Foley last week, after his retirement announcement. \n\"I would say for me, yeah, I've thought about it for a long time, but the timing became more clear to me over the course of the \nlast few months,\" he insisted. \nWhen asked if Gates asked him to stay or go, he said no, apparently to both. \"Bill respects my decision. I mean, it's one of \nthese things when if it's — you know, ultimately these kinds of things have to be one's own personal decision.\" \nThat statement also struck many inside the company as a quick shift. Ballmer, said sources, had been jumping \nenthusiastically into business review meetings, as part of the new structure, over the last month. In addition, he had \nexpressed to many employees his excitement at being part of the changes he had initiated. \nBut, in meetings after the announcement, numerous sources inside the company said Ballmer seemed uncharacteristically \nchastened and quiet, in contrast to his usual confident and forceful manner. \n\"He was definitely not leaving and then he suddenly was,\" said one source. \"Even if today's Steve made the choice, it was a \nchoice yesterday's Steve did not want to.\" \nAnother source, close to the board, perhaps explained it best: \"If ValueAct got on the board, I think Ballmer finally realized \nthat meant it was going to be the hard way from then on out until he left and he did not want that for a company he clearly \nloves and has been his life.\" \nNow, those inside the company are turning to what comes next. While not everyone on the board thought that Ballmer \nshould step down without a new CEO in place, it's moot now as Microsoft turbocharges the process — in place for several \nyears now — to select its next leader. \nBut, though the committee is headed up by John Thompson, CEO of Virtual Instruments and the former CEO of security \nsoftware giant Symantec, most expect Gates — as usual — to be the key decision maker on that choice, too. \nA Microsoft spokesman declined comment. \nBack to top \nThe Decline of E-Empires  \nPaul Krugman — New York Times \nSteve Ballmer's surprise announcement that he will be resigning as Microsoft's C.E.O. has set off a huge flood of \ncommentary. Being neither a tech geek nor a management guru, I can't add much on those fronts. I do, however, think I \nknow a bit about economics, and I also read a lot of history. So the Ballmer announcement has me thinking about network \nexternalities and Ibn Khaldun. And thinking about these things, I'd argue, can help ensure that we draw the right lessons \nfrom this particular corporate upheaval. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028630 \nFirst, about network externalities: Consider the state of the computer industry circa 2000, when Microsoft's share price hit its \npeak and the company seemed utterly dominant. Remember the T-shirts depicting Bill Gates as a Borg (part of the hive \nmind from \"Star Trek\"), with the legend, \"Resistance is futile. Prepare to be assimilated\"? Remember when Microsoft was at \nthe center of concerns about antitrust enforcement? \nThe odd thing was that nobody seemed to like Microsoft's products. By all accounts, Apple computers were better than PCs \nusing Windows as their operating system. Yet the vast majority of desktop and laptop computers ran Windows. Why? \nThe answer, basically, is that everyone used Windows because everyone used Windows. If you had a Windows PC and \nwanted help, you could ask the guy in the next cubicle, or the tech people downstairs, and have a very good chance of \ngetting the answer you needed. Software was designed to run on PCs; peripheral devices were designed to work with PCs. \nThat's network externalities in action, and it made Microsoft a monopolist. \nThe story of how that state of affairs arose is tangled, but I don't think it's too unfair to say that Apple mistakenly believed that \nordinary buyers would value its superior quality as much as its own people did. So it charged premium prices, and by the \ntime it realized how many people were choosing cheaper machines that weren't insanely great but did the job, Microsoft's \ndominance was locked in. \nNow, any such discussion brings out the Apple faithful, who insist that anything Windows can do Apple can do better and \nthat only idiots buy PCs. They may be right. But it doesn't matter, because there are many such idiots, myself included. And \nWindows still dominates the personal computer market. \nThe trouble for Microsoft came with the rise of new devices whose importance it famously failed to grasp. \"There's no \nchance,\" declared Mr. Ballmer in 2007, \"that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share.\" \nHow could Microsoft have been so blind? Here's where Ibn Khaldun comes in. He was a 14th-century Islamic philosopher \nwho basically invented what we would now call the social sciences. And one insight he had, based on the history of his \nnative North Africa, was that there was a rhythm to the rise and fall of dynasties. \nDesert tribesmen, he argued, always have more courage and social cohesion than settled, civilized folk, so every once in a \nwhile they will sweep in and conquer lands whose rulers have become corrupt and complacent. They create a new dynasty \n— and, over time, become corrupt and complacent themselves, ready to be overrun by a new set of barbarians. \nI don't think it's much of a stretch to apply this story to Microsoft, a company that did so well with its operating-system \nmonopoly that it lost focus, while Apple — still wandering in the wilderness after all those years — was alert to new \nopportunities. And so the barbarians swept in from the desert. \nSometimes, by the way, barbarians are invited in by a domestic faction seeking a shake-up. This may be what's happening \nat Yahoo: Marissa Mayer doesn't look much like a fierce Bedouin chieftain, but she's arguably filling the same functional \nrole. \nAnyway, the funny thing is that Apple's position in mobile devices now bears a strong resemblance to Microsoft's former \nposition in operating systems. True, Apple produces high-quality products. But they are, by most accounts, little if any better \nthan those of rivals, while selling at premium prices. \nSo why do people buy them? Network externalities: lots of other people use iWhatevers, there are more apps for iOS than \nfor other systems, so Apple becomes the safe and easy choice. Meet the new boss, same as the old boss. \nIs there a policy moral here? Let me make at least a negative case: Even though Microsoft did not, in fact, end up taking over \nthe world, those antitrust concerns weren't misplaced. Microsoft was a monopolist, it did extract a lot of monopoly rents, and \nit did inhibit innovation. Creative destruction means that monopolies aren't forever, but it doesn't mean that they're harmless \nwhile they last. This was true for Microsoft yesterday; it may be true for Apple, or Google, or someone not yet on our radar, \ntomorrow. \nBack to top \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028631 \nState Budgets and Healthcare costs — Full text articles \nHow to Charge $546 for Six Liters of Saltwater \nNina Bernstein — New York Times \nIt is one of the most common components of emergency medicine: an intravenous bag of sterile saltwater. \nLuckily for anyone who has ever needed an IV bag to replenish lost fluids or to receive medication, it is also one of the least \nexpensive. The average manufacturer's price, according to government data, has fluctuated in recent years from 44 cents to \n$1. \nYet there is nothing either cheap or simple about its ultimate cost, as I learned when I tried to trace the commercial path of IV \nbags from the factory to the veins of more than 100 patients struck by a May 2012 outbreak of food poisoning in upstate New \nYork. \nSome of the patients' bills would later include markups of 100 to 200 times the manufacturer's price, not counting separate \ncharges for \"IV administration.\" And on other bills, a bundled charge for \"IV therapy\" was almost 1,000 times the official cost \nof the solution. \nIt is no secret that medical care in the United States is overpriced. But as the tale of the humble IV bag shows all too clearly, it \nis secrecy that helps keep prices high: hidden in the underbrush of transactions among multiple buyers and sellers, and in \nthe hieroglyphics of hospital bills. \nAt every step from manufacturer to patient, there are confidential deals among the major players, including drug companies, \npurchasing organizations and distributors, and insurers. These deals so obscure prices and profits that even participants \ncannot say what the simplest component of care actually costs, let alone what it should cost. \nAnd that leaves taxpayers and patients alike with an inflated bottom line and little or no way to challenge it. \nA PRICE IN FLUX \nIn the food-poisoning case, some of the stricken were affluent, and others barely made ends meet. Some had private \ninsurance; some were covered by government programs like Medicare and Medicaid; and some were uninsured. \nIn the end, those factors strongly (and sometimes perversely) affected overall charges for treatment, including how much \npatients were expected to pay out of pocket. But at the beginning, there was the cost of an IV bag of normal saline, one of \nmore than a billion units used in the United States each year. \n\"People are shocked when they hear that a bag of saline solution costs far less than their cup of coffee in the morning,\" said \nDeborah Spak, a spokeswoman for Baxter International, one of three global pharmaceutical companies that make nearly all \nthe IV solutions used in the United States. \nIt was a rare unguarded comment. Ms. Spak — like a spokesman for Hospira, another giant in the field — later insisted that \nall information about saline solution prices was private. \nIn fact, manufacturers are required to report such prices annually to the federal government, which bases Medicare \npayments on the average national price plus 6 percent. The limit for one liter of normal saline (a little more than a quart) went \nto $1.07 this year from 46 cents in 2010, an increase manufacturers linked to the cost of raw materials, fuel and \ntransportation. That would seem to make it the rare medical item that is cheaper in the United States than in France, where \nthe price at a typical hospital in Paris last year was 3.62 euros, or $4.73. One-liter IV bags normally contain nine grams of \nsalt, less than two teaspoons. Much of it comes from a major Morton Salt operation in Rittman, Ohio, which uses a \nsubterranean salt deposit formed millions of years ago. The water is local to places like Round Lake, Ill., or Rocky Mount, \nN.C., where Baxter and Hospira, respectively, run their biggest automated production plants under sterility standards set by \nthe Food and Drug Administration. \nBut even before the finished product is sold by the case or the truckload, the real cost of a bag of normal saline, like the true \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028632 \ncost of medical supplies from gauze to heart implants, disappears into an opaque realm of byzantine contracts, confidential \nrebates and fees that would be considered illegal kickbacks in many other industries. \nIV bags can function like cheap milk and eggs in a high-priced grocery store, or like the one-cent cellphone locked into an \nexpensive service contract. They serve as loss leaders in exclusive contracts with \"preferred manufacturers\" that bundle \ntogether expensive drugs and basics, or throw in \"free\" medical equipment with costly consequences. \nFew hospitals negotiate these deals themselves. Instead, they rely on two formidable sets of middlemen: a few giant group-\npurchasing organizations that negotiate high-volume contracts, and a few giant distributors that buy and store medical \nsupplies and deliver them to client hospitals. \nProponents of this system say it saves hospitals billions in economies of scale. Critics say the middlemen not only take their \ncut, but they have a strong interest in keeping most prices high and competition minimal. \nThe top three group-purchasing organizations now handle contracts for more than half of all institutional medical supplies \nsold in the United States, including the IVs used in the food-poisoning case, which were bought and taken by truck to \nregional warehouses by big distributors. \nThese contracts proved to be another black box. Debbie Mitchell, a spokeswoman for Cardinal Health, one of the three \nlargest distributors, said she could not discuss costs or prices under \"disclosure rules relative to our investor relations.\" \nDistributors match different confidential prices for the same product with each hospital's contract, she said, and sell \ninformation about the buyers back to manufacturers. \nA huge Cardinal distribution center is in Montgomery, N.Y. — only 30 miles, as it happens, from the landscaped grounds of \nthe Buddhist monastery in Carmel, N.Y., where many of the food-poisoning victims fell ill on Mother's Day 2012. \nAmong them were families on 10 tour buses that had left Chinatown in Manhattan that morning to watch dragon dances at \nthe monastery. After eating lunch from food stalls there, some traveled on to the designer outlet stores at Woodbury \nCommons, about 30 miles away, before falling sick. \nThe symptoms were vicious. \"Within two hours of eating that rice that I had bought, I was lying on the ground barely \nconscious,\" said Dr. Elizabeth Frost, 73, an anesthesiologist from Purchase in Westchester County who was visiting the \nmonastery gardens with two friends. \"I can't believe no one died.\" \nAbout 100 people were taken to hospitals in the region by ambulance; 5 were admitted and the rest released the same day. \nThe New York State Department of Health later found the cause was a common bacterium, Staphylococcus aureus, from \nimproperly cooked or stored food sold in the stalls. \nMYSTERIOUS CHARGES \nThe sick entered a health care ecosystem under strain, swept by consolidation and past efforts at cost containment. \nFor more than a decade, hospitals in the Hudson Valley, like those across the country, have scrambled for mergers and \nalliances to offset economic pressures from all sides. The five hospitals where most of the victims were treated are all part of \nmerged entities jockeying for bargaining power and market share — or worrying that other players will leave them struggling \nto survive. \nThe Affordable Care Act encourages these developments as it drives toward a reimbursement system that strives to keep \npeople out of hospitals through more coordinated, cost-efficient care paid on the basis of results, not services. But the billing \nmysteries in the food poisoning case show how easily cost-cutting can turn into cost-shifting. \nA Chinese-American toddler from Brooklyn and her 56-year-old grandmother, treated and released within hours from the \nemergency room at St. Luke's Cornwall Hospital, ran up charges of more than $4,000 and were billed for $1,400 — the \nhospital's rate for the uninsured, even though the family is covered by a health maintenance organization under Medicaid, \nthe federal-state program for poor people. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028633 \nThe charges included \"IV therapy,\" billed at $787 for the adult and $393 for the child, which suggests that the difference in \nthe amount of saline infused, typically less than a liter, could alone account for several hundred dollars. \nTricia O'Malley, a spokeswoman for the hospital, would not disclose the price it pays per IV bag or break down the therapy \ncharge, which she called the hospital's \"private pay rate,\" or the sticker price charged to people without insurance. She said \nshe could not explain why patients covered by Medicaid were billed at all. \nEventually the head of the family, an electrician's helper who speaks little English, complained to HealthFirst, the Medicaid \nH.M.O. It paid $119 to settle the grandmother's $2,168 bill, without specifying how much of the payment was for the IV. It \npaid $66.50 to the doctor, who had billed $606. \nAt White Plains Hospital, a patient with private insurance from Aetna was charged $91 for one unit of Hospira IV that cost the \nhospital 86 cents, according to a hospital spokeswoman, Eliza O'Neill. \nMs. O'Neill defended the markup as \"consistent with industry standards.\" She said it reflected \"not only the cost of the \nsolution but a variety of related services and processes,\" like procurement, biomedical handling and storage, apparently not \nincluded in a charge of $127 for administering the IV and $893 for emergency-room services. \nThe patient, a financial services professional in her 50s, ended up paying $100 for her visit. \"Honestly, I don't understand the \nsystem at all,\" said the woman, who shared the information on the condition that she not be named. \nDr. Frost, the anesthesiologist, spent three days in the same hospital and owed only $8, thanks to insurance coverage by \nUnited HealthCare. Still, she was baffled by the charges: $6,844, including $546 for six liters of saline that cost the hospital \n$5.16. \n\"It's just absolutely absurd.\" she said. \"That's saltwater.\" \nLast fall, I appealed to the New York State Department of Health for help in mapping the charges for rehydrating patients in \nthe food poisoning episode. Deploying software normally used to detect Medicaid fraud, a team compiled a chart of what \nMedicaid and Medicare were billed in six of the cases. \nBut the department has yet to release the chart. It is under indefinite review, Bill Schwarz, a department spokesman, said, \n\"to ensure confidential information is not compromised.\" \nBack to top \nStates scramble to get health-care law's insurance marketplaces up and running \nSarah Kliff and Sandhya Somashekhar - Washington Post \nWith a key deadline approaching, state officials across the country are scrambling to get the Affordable Care Act's complex \ncomputer systems up and running, reviewing contingency plans and, in some places, preparing for delays. \nOct. 1 is the scheduled launch date for the health-care law's insurance marketplaces — online sites where uninsured people \nwill be able to shop for coverage, sometimes using a government subsidy to purchase a plan. An estimated 7 million people \nare expected to use these portals to purchase health coverage in 2014. \nThe task is unprecedented in its complexity, requiring state and federal data systems to transmit reams of information \nbetween one another. Some officials in charge of setting up the systems say that the tight deadlines have forced them to \ntake shortcuts when it comes to testing and that some of the bells and whistles will not be ready. \n\"There's a certain level of panic about how much needs to be accomplished but a general sense that the bare minimum to \nget the system functional will be done,\" said Matt Salo, executive director of the National Association of Medicaid Directors. \n\"It will by no means be as smooth and as seamless as people expected.\" \nOregon announced this month that it will delay consumers' direct access to its marketplace, opening the Web site only to \nbrokers and consumer-assistance agents in order to shield consumers from opening-day glitches. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028634 \n\"Even though we're testing now, once you actually have the system up, you don't know what the bugs will be,\" said Amy \nFauver, spokeswoman for Cover Oregon, the state agency implementing the law there. \nIn California, which has the nation's largest uninsured population, health officials have begun hinting that they may have a \nsimilar problem. \n\"It's a complex system, and there's a lot of navigation that needs to happen,\" said Oscar Hidalgo, a spokesman for Covered \nCalifornia. He said the agency will know by early September whether the system will be ready in time. \nIf not, he said, customers will still be able to log on to the Web site and peruse insurance plans and view prices. When they \nget to the final step, however, they will not be able to sign up. They will have to contact a customer service representative to \ncomplete the final enrollment step. \nOfficials with the District of Columbia's Health Link decided to put off building a Spanish version of its Web site until later this \nyear, giving its staff bandwidth to complete other tasks they see more critical to the launch. \nUntil then, the District will have bilingual call-center workers and in-person helpers who will be able to help Spanish speakers \nnavigate the site. \nThe hiccups are troubling to advocates, who worry that there will be mistakes that result in people being erroneously \nrejected by Medicaid or denied subsidies to which they are entitled. They are concerned that impediments will discourage \nthe uninsured from signing up for coverage. \n\"There will be something up and running, but there will be serious, serious difficulties with it\" that could result in delays and \nerrors initially, said Robert H. Bonthius Jr., a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society of Cleveland. \"It's an extremely ambitious \nprogram, well-intentioned, that is going to be very difficult to accomplish, and it's going to be months and maybe years \nbefore it really gets sorted out.\" \nMuch of the difficulty stems from the information the federal government needs to determine who qualifies for which health-\nlaw program, including data on citizenship, income, residence and employment. State systems will need to communicate \nseamlessly with a federal data hub that pulls in information from the Department of Homeland Security and the Internal \nRevenue Service, among others. \nPresident Obama has predicted \"bumps\" and \"glitches\" in the initial launch of the exchanges. Health and Human Services \nSecretary Kathleen Sebelius has acknowledged a very tight time frame that has required the government to test the hub in \nimperfect conditions, but she has said it will still launch on time. \n\"Ideally what you would do if you were building a data hub that needs this kind of information, you'd put a piece together and \ntest that. You test it, if you will, sequentially,\" she said in an interview. \"We have to build and test simultaneously. ... It's a big \noperational issue, but all systems are a go for the first of October.\" \nSixteen states decided to build their own health-insurance marketplaces, with the rest leaving all or much of the task to the \nfederal government. Those states are now in the process of, or have completed, testing to share data back and forth with the \ndata hub. \n\"There were times when the hub had to be taken offline. ... So we couldn't test until they got it back online,\" said Jon Hager, \nexecutive director of Nevada's Silver State Health Insurance Exchange. \"But I think the end result, and everything I've seen, \nsays it will be ready.\" \nHager has invested significant time preparing contingency plans for his state, including one for a situation in which the \nfederal data hub does not work, though he said he believes that to be a relatively unlikely scenario. \n\"If there's a new rule, that could throw us into a quandary,\" Hager said. \"You could have, I don't know, a disaster or a fire. I \nthink we've got backup and contingency plans for everything.\" \nThe federal government handles all testing of these connections for states that did not build a portal and chose instead to \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028635 \nrely on the federally facilitated marketplace. \nState Medicaid programs, which typically serve low-income individuals, are also undergoing testing with the federal data \nhub. At least one state, Arizona, has not begun that work. It will start testing in September, a late start that worries the \nexecutive director of the state's marketplace. \n\"It's a concern that we're testing this late,\" said Tom Betlach, who runs the Arizona Health Care Cost Containment System. \n\"Usually when you do testing, you have to go ahead and address any changes. Given the October 1st start date, I don't know \nmuch of it will be an iterative process.\" \nBack to top \n80 House members: Shutdown better than Obamacare \nCharles Babington —Associated Press \nMore than one-third of House Republicans urged their leader Thursday to trigger a government shutdown rather than pay for \nthe implementation of the health-care law they call Obamacare. \nA letter from 80 Republicans asked Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to resist any spending bills that would accommodate the \nnew health-care law, which is nearing a critical stage of signing up millions of Americans for health coverage. \nBecause it's virtually certain that President Obama and the Democrat-controlled Senate would reject such demands, \nleaders of both parties say the standoff likely would result in a partial shutdown of the federal government, similar to those \nthat occurred in 1995 and 1996. \nThe letter is mixed news for Boehner and other GOP leaders who view a government shutdown as politically unwise. \nThe federal 2013 fiscal year ends Sept. 30. New money must be appropriated by then to avoid a shutdown of countless \ngovernment offices and agencies. \nVoters chiefly blamed congressional Republicans for the mid-1990s shutdowns, and the fallout boosted Democratic \nPresident Clinton. Ever since, many establishment Republicans have urged the party to avoid using shutdown threats as a \nbargaining tool. \nBut a new generation of tea-party-backed conservatives rejects the advice. They say \"Obamacare\" — officially the \nAffordable Care Act — is so unpopular and unworkable that it justifies extraordinary tactics to block it. \nA possible solution to the budget impasse, often used in past years, would involve a \"continuing resolution\" to keep funding \nthe government at current levels. Many top Republicans, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, say it's \nimpossible to carve out money for Obamacare in any appropriations measure. \nThe House letter was authored by Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C. It urges Boehner \"to affirmatively de-fund the \nimplementation and enforcement of Obamacare in any relevant appropriations bill,\" including \"any continuing \nappropriations bill.\" \nAt least a dozen Senate Republicans have signed a similar letter. \nIn recent years, Democrats and Republicans in Congress repeatedly have failed to reach major compromises on spending. \nThe impasses led this year to automatic, across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration, which have hampered \nsome federal agencies and helped shrink the deficit. \nBack to top \nBerkshire Hathaway — Full text articles \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028636 \nNo breaking news \nBack to top  \nPhilanthropy — Full text articles \nPhilanthropy: the givers club \nCordelia Jenkins— Livemint and the Wall Street Journal \nOn Friday, around 60 prospective philanthropists attended the \"First Givers Club\" summit in Delhi run by the online \nphilanthropic donation forum Givelndia. While the club has existed in Mumbai since 2010, said Dhaval Udani, Givelndia's \nCEO, this was their first foray into the capital city. Mint was the media partner of the event. \n\"With this club, we wanted to create a platform for like-minded individuals to build a community of donors who share \nknowledge and vision; it will also help to facilitate giving effectively,\" Udani told his audience. \"Our aim is to help you get \nmore exposure and awareness of the different aspects of philanthropy; over the last three years this club has helped \nchannel more than Rs.18 crore to the lives of more than 10,000 underprivileged in India.\" \nRakesh Bharti Mittal, vice-chairman and managing director of Bharti Enterprises, along with speakers Anu Aga of Thermax \nand Amit Chandra of Bain Capital gave their perspectives on how and where to give effectively and on the future of Indian \nphilanthropy. Edited excerpts: \nRakesh Mittal set up the Satya Bharti school programmes in 2006. The aim was to set up 500 primary and 50 secondary \nschools of its own with a corpus of Rs.200 crore. After that, state governments began reaching out and Bharti began \nadopting government schools, creating a public-private partnership in delivering quality education to rural children. \n\"Given the new companies Bill, which has been passed by Parliament, I assume within the next two three months the rules \nwill be finalized; there is going to be a mad rush for seeking funding. Already, I get a letter every other day for supporting a \ncause. If I see corporates have been very powerful instruments and drivers of philanthropy, this comes from the wider \nwealth creation and management role which they do in their businesses. Today they are looking at doing more beyond \nbusiness, not because the government is forcing them, but because we cannot have islands of wealth. You cannot take this \ncountry forward if we are just worried about what I have and what I need for me and my family, and the ecosystem and the \nsociety around is crumbling. This country will not move forward.\" \n\"If I go back a few centuries giving had been a very rich tradition; it used to be that 10% of your income would be kept aside \nfor a cause. During those times more money went into either building temples or temples of learning, which are the schools \nand colleges. Pre-1990, Indian corporates were not giving that much, including the individuals, and there was a reason \nbecause we did not have sustainable wealth creation opportunities, either for ourselves, our families, or our large \nstakeholders as we were running the companies. \n\"This all changed in the post-1991 year of liberalization. In the last two decades, more and more, new age economies moved \nthis country to prosperous economic growth and suddenly you saw people wanting to give back to society because now you \nhave a model which was creating sustainable wealth for yourself.\" \n\"There are individuals who may give money and their time, but there are also entrepreneurs, young entrepreneurs who \nproduce products which are low in cost but make a huge impact for the people who use it. This is the brief India is looking at \nin the landscape today and this will be a stepping stone for the future.\" \n\"Giving at Bharti has always been part of our DNA, it was always our endeavour to make a difference. At the beginning, in \nthe mid-70s, we were more interested in creating businesses which could impact society at large. If I look at telecom, retail, \nagri and food processing we wanted to make a difference and not a buck. In 2000 we set up Bharti Foundation with the sole \nobjective of supporting the youth of India and enabling the underprivileged to come and compete with anyone. \n\"We started writing cheques and one day I felt that was not the purpose, the fact is there are 320 million children in the age of \n6-16, we talk of demographic dividend—absolutely yes, if we nurture this potential, but if we don't do justice to these children \nthere is a disaster which is waiting to happen. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028637 \n\"The way things are going I am not feeling very positive. I am a born optimist; we are spending billions of dollars but is that \nbeing delivered efficiently? The answer is no, all of us know that, and that's why we keep going back to the government; \npublic-private—partnerships is going to be the key to move forward, you have the resources we have the management \nexpertise let's join hands. And it has started moving.\" \nAnu Aga led Thermax Ltd from 1996-2004, after retirement she remains on the company's board of directors. The \nchairperson of TFI (Teach For India) was nominated to Rajya Sabha in 2012. \n\"My giving actually started when I lost my son, who was 25 and died in a car accident. Having studied abroad, poverty really \nbothered him. We who live in India, we become quite insensitive to seeing poor people, but he kept saying a substantial part \nof our wealth has to go to charity.\" \n\"It started in a very small way, it's not as if I gave away crores and crores at once. It started with me getting personally \ninvolved and I like that model very much, I'm not very happy with just writing a cheque and not getting involved. I was \ninvolved with Akansksha and then I was invited to join their board—it ran centres for slum children and I brought it to Pune. \n\"We have six schools, now this is done by the CSR wing of Thermax, but Shaheen (Mistry) then started Teach For India, \nwhich personally I support. \n\"From the family wealth, it's my daughter and I who decide on things. The bulk of our giving is to Teach For India and \nAkanksha, but we also give to an institute called Parivaar in Calcutta, which is for the poorest of the poor. In Bihar we are \ngiving to a school run by an ex-police officer for the rat-eating tribe. The main underlining thing is credibility. Giving without \nbeing involved does give me that little fear, but at the same time I would rather make a few mistakes than mistrust \neverybody. \n\"There is a lovely body called Caring Friends in Bombay, where a few hundred people meet informally. It's not an NGO, the \ntwo people who started it incubate NGOs which are new from their own money, and after a few years when they become \ncredible, bring it to the others and ask for money from them.\" \nAmit Chandra is managing director of Bain Capital and responsible for the firm's India initiative. He is also chairperson of the \nAkanksha Foundation that works in the field of education for less privileged children. \n\"Even though I came from a lower middle class family, we were always taught as children to give and share whatever we \nhad. For me the big inflection points were as I was working at DSP Merrill Lynch and I rose through the ranks, I got success \nrelatively early. I was running the firm before I was 35 but there was still a sense of unease that I had with everything I saw \naround me. I think the unease was on two counts, one was that by virtue of running what was the largest investment bank at \nthat time I got to work with a lot of families and I realized that wealth did not necessarily translate into happiness when you \nreally got to know a lot of these people individually. \n\"In fact, wealth built a sense of entitlement amongst the next generation, it built a sense of extreme bitterness amongst \nsiblings, and it often was a source of great degree of unhappiness. And another thing, having had the opportunity to study in \nthe West, I realized that when you look at leaders with legacy, a very vast percentage of leaders who had any degree of \nlegacy where the ones who had given back to society. These issues were beginning to bother me. \n\"My wife and I were inspired by what Chuck Feeney (Irish-American businessman and philanthropist and the founder of The \nAtlantic Philanthropies) did. We decided to cap the amount of wealth we wanted to have as a family, and so my wife and I \nwalked into a lawyer's office, and I transferred how much she thought was needed for her, my daughter, and to support my \nliving, and we said from this day onwards everything else basically goes to charity. \n\"What that did for us was actually incredible because our constraint after that point in time was to find good causes that \ncould be scaled up. That's where the Givelndia team came in extremely handy because we've set a budget every year for \nourselves which is higher than the previous year with the objective really being to effectively give away all our income every \nyear. \n\"I think giving your time is critical to being able to scale up giving your money. The two things have to go hand in hand. There \nis no substitute to actually giving time and approaching it the same way you would approach businesses and investments. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028638 \nThe biggest network we use is the GiveIndia network. Working with their team allows us to screen and monitor, before that \nwe were able to support a handful of NG0s. Now we have a reasonable portfolio across all the areas we are interested in.

The lamp has a built-in solar \npanel to charge its four AA-sized batteries. \nThe lantern has an obvious advantage over kerosone-fuelled equivalents: with no flame or smoke emissions, it is safer and \nmore environmentally friendly. The batteries are made for 500 cycles, or about two years, but the longevity of the lamps in \nEthiopia has come as a pleasant surprise. In a novel twist, the lantern, which costs $38 (£24.50), can also be used to charge \nmobile phones. \nThe award provided a huge fillip for Thakkar's company, Sunlite. As word spread, relief agencies placed increasingly large \norders. About 100,000 of the lamps have been (or are being) used after emergencies in Japan, the Philippines, Thailand and \nSyria. \nSunlite makes 15,000 lamps a month at two plants in India, including one in a special economic zone in Gujarat state. \nNext month, there will be a new winner at AidEx in Brussels, the third year of the award. The innovation award sits alongside \na crowded field of honours in the development world, although AidEx is geared more towards humanitarian needs. \nAwards seem to be proliferating. Last month, 53 finalists met in Washington to showcase ideas to save the lives of mothers \nand newborns in developing countries. The award is given by the Saving Lives at Birth partnership, launched in 2011, which \nincludes USAid, Norway, Grand Challenges Canada, backed by the Canadian government, the UK's Department for \nInternational Development, and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. \nIn October, the Mo Ibrahim foundation will announce its prize for achievement in African leadership, established in 2007. \nPast winners include presidents Joaquim Chissano and Festus Gontebanye Mogae, of Mozambique and Botswana \nrespectively, although the prize is not awarded if no one meets the criteria. \nSceptics may wonder whether these accolades contribute meaningfully to development, or exist only to make donors feel \ngood while sidestepping more fundamental, structural issues. For instance, the Gates foundation awarded $100,000 to the \nCalifornia Institute of Technology last year for designing a solar-powered toilet that breaks down water and human waste \ninto hydrogen gas for use in fuel cells. \nThe competition was for \"next-generation\" toilets to improve sanitation in the developing world. Would that money have \nbeen better spent on supporting community-led total sanitation — a project to end open defecation that has had considerable \nsuccess? \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028639 \nCalestous Juma, international development professor at the Kennedy school of government and a nominator, judge and \npromoter of new types of prizes, sees awards as part of a complex ecology of financing innovation that includes many other \ninstruments. He believes there should be more prizes for humanitarian work and development. \n\"Doing humanitarian work may look like a thankless job. Yet it is driven by the instinct of empathy that makes us human,\" \nsaid Juma, author of The New Harvest: Agricultural Innovation in Africa. \"Honouring, rewarding, celebrating and inspiring \nwork in this area is more needed today than ever. This is an area that can use more societal recognition, especially at a time \nwhen the whole aid industry is under scrutiny.\" \nHowever, Juma says prizes need to be carefully thought out. \"Many organisations are launching them without thinking \ncarefully about what prizes can do or cannot do.\" \nThe AidEx challenge's lead judge, Michael Pritchard, inventor of the Lifesaver water bottle, says the award is not so much \nabout the money— £2,000 — as validation, although the publicity can be a much-needed boost. \n\"The validation goes an awfully long way to get the product developed and provides a big leg-up into getting it into the \nmarket,\" he said. \"It gets written up all over the world and gets the oxygen of publicity.\" \nAs for Thakkar, he says winning the AidEx award has been a positive experience: \"Winning the award made a huge \ndifference, it increased publicity. People look more favourably on us and [that] gives us an extra edge. We don't have to sell it \nas much. But we don't want to be just appreciated, we want the lamp to be used extensively.\" \nBack to top  \nEducation — Full text articles \nA Chance at Learning \nGinia Bellafante — New York Times \nThis year, a study administered by researchers at Harvard and Stanford drew significant attention for what it revealed about \nhow inadequately low-income students are represented at selective colleges and universities. Only 34 percent of the \nhighest-achieving high-school seniors whose families fell in the bottom quarter of income distribution — versus 78 percent \nin the top quarter — attended one of the country's most selective colleges, based on a list of nearly 250 schools compiled by \nBarron's. \nIn New York City, where a neighborhood like Bushwick, in Brooklyn, can seem like a satellite campus of Wesleyan and a \nprewar apartment building on the Upper East Side can feel like an Ivy League dormitory for 46-year-olds, there has been \nconsiderable philanthropic attention, of the kind other cities ought to envy, paid to finding the most gifted low-income \nstudents and putting them on a similar path. \nIn 1978, Gary Simons, a Bronx teacher, founded Prep for Prep with the goal of identifying talented students of color in the \ncity and readying them for attendance at private schools like Dalton and Groton and so on. Hundreds of the program's \nalumni have gone on to law, medical and business schools, and employment at Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and \nTime Warner. \nA decade ago, hoping also to advance the best students attending public high schools, Mr. Simons and others founded \nanother organization, Leadership Enterprise for a Diverse America, or LEDA, which draws exceptional children from around \nthe country, regardless of race, almost entirely from families who make less than $55,000 a year. Applicants are required to \nbe in the top 10 percent of their class, having taken the most difficult courses their schools offer. The 60 who gain entry to the \nprogram each year spend the summer before 12th grade at Princeton, studying ethics, political theory and public policy, and \npreparing for standardized college entrance exams. \nIn a wondrous righting of the current disequilibrium, however small its scale, they are tutored for those tests by the same \ninstructors who work with some of Manhattan's wealthiest teenagers: the staff of Advantage Testing, whose services cost \nparents up to $795 an hour. Arun Alagappan, the founder and president of Advantage and a major benefactor of LEDA, \nprovides his employees (whose résumés typically resemble those of the people at Google or McKinsey) pro bono. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028640 \nLEDA has been very successful. Of the 500 or so students who have graduated from the program, three quarters have gone \non to top-tier colleges, 30 percent of them to the Ivy League. Among LEDA's 2012 graduates alone, 19 gained admission to \nPrinceton, 11 to Georgetown and 6 to the University of Pennsylvania. \nLast week I took a walk around Red Hook, Brooklyn, with Joshua El-Bey, a LEDA graduate who was leaving in a few days \nfor his sophomore year at Yale. His family struggled as he grew up, moving often and ultimately landing in the Red Hook \nHouses, the borough's largest public housing development. His first memories of book learning, he told me, were the \nreadings his mother delivered from Genesis when he was 2. What was disconcerting about Mr. El-Bey's otherwise incredibly \ninspiring trajectory was how much of his success had depended on opportunities outside the public education system. \nBullied in middle school for his studiousness, Mr. El-Bey hoped to gain admission to one of the city's elite specialized public \nhigh schools, but he did not do well enough on the entrance exam. The free tutoring provided by the city for the test was \ninsufficient, he said. \nHe ended up at Edward R. Murrow in Midwood, Brooklyn, a good school whose academics were nevertheless surpassed by \nthe supplemental training he received as a scholar at Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, an organization begun 50 \nyears ago by Manhattan lawyers and advertising executives as a mentoring program to get poor minority students into good \ncolleges. Today it essentially provides a shadow education. In school, Mr. El-Bey told me, he simply learned to \"regurgitate \nfacts.\" \nPrograms like LEDA and S.E.O. are popular with wealthy, supremely educated donors, precisely because of outcomes like \nMr. El-Bey's. Just this May, the financier Henry R. Kravis pledged $4 million in matching gifts to S.E.O. \nAnd in a city as dense with talent and money as New York, the effects of such philanthropy can be effortlessly observed. \nWalking through his neighborhood, Mr. El-Bey ran into another alumnus of S.E.O., Luis Hernandez, who was about to begin \nhis freshman year at the University of Southern California. In a precocious accomplishment more typical in other \nneighborhoods, Mr. Hernandez had won a screenwriting contest for a film about obesity that had already made its debut on \nthe Showtime cable channel. \nAs a society we have begun to pay increasing and essential attention to gaining access to the top, but the brightest among \nus might do well to apply equal focus to how we might enhance the middle. \nMost students, rich or poor, will not go to Harvard, while plenty of working-class and poor students will go to colleges that \nserve them not nearly well enough. Not long ago, our son's caregiver, who is taking classes at LaGuardia Community \nCollege in Queens, showed me a paper she had written for a class in English composition taught by a teacher who was \nconsistently late and twice absent. It was on lbsen's \"A Doll's House\" and my husband had helped her. It incisively analyzed \nthe play's theme of 19th-century marital oppression and was impeccably written. \nWhen our nanny received her grade, she was shocked not to have done as well as she had expected. Her formatting had \nbeen imprecise, the teacher told her. And there was a problem with spacing. Content seemed not to matter much at all. \nBack to top  \nObama goes for college 'datapalooza'  \nNick Anderson —Washington Post \nIn President Obama's plan to overhaul higher education, which envisions using new federal ratings of colleges to determine \nlevels of student aid, there is a deep faith in the power of information and innovation to catalyze change in colleges and \nuniversities. \nUltimately, the belief is that these forces will make college more affordable. \nYet academia has witnessed and taken part in many waves of innovation in the past half-century, and affordability remains \nelusive. \nThe administration's faith is encapsulated in a word the White House used this week in a fact sheet about the plan: \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028641 \n\"Datapalooza.\" Here's the reference: \n\"New college ratings will help students compare the value offered by different colleges,\" the fact sheet said. \"The \nDepartment of Education will enlist entrepreneurs and technology leaders with a 'Datapalooza' to catalyze new private-\nsector tools, services, and apps to help students evaluate and select colleges. The effort will be complemented by earnings \ninformation by college that will be released for the first time on [the] administration's College Scorecard this fall.\" \nWhat is a datapalooza? Apparently, it is a festival of, or related to, data. The White House and the Education Department \nhosted such an event Oct. 9. Students and parents are arguably awash in data now, much of it conflicting and confusing. \nSome would say more is better. \nFew would argue that better data would be best of all for the consumer. \nThe yen for better data is shared not just by Obama but also by some colleges. Start with graduation rates. \nNow, the federal government measures how many students graduate within four years or six years of starting college. But it \nonly measures that for students who are first-timers, who are enrolled full-time and who don't transfer from one institution to \nanother, omitting a huge share of the college population. Millions of students are part-timers. Community colleges with \nexcellent records of getting students into prestigious four-year schools are not rewarded for their efforts if those students fail \nto pick up an associate's degree before they transfer. Nor are four-year colleges that give transfer students or former \ndropouts a second chance and help them get a bachelor's degree. \nThe Association of Public and Land-grant Universities, which represents schools such as the University of Maryland, is \nspearheading an effort to improve this flawed metric, using not only federal data but also information from the nonprofit \nNational Student Clearinghouse to track degree completion for students who move from one school to another. \nOne question Education Secretary Arne Duncan will face, as he confers with colleges to create a ratings system within the \nnext two years, is what kind of graduation rate the government will use. Another is what kind of data the government will \nreport on income of college graduates. \nAll we know about the federal rating metrics at this point are rough sketches from the fact sheet, highlighting these potential \nfactors: \"access, such as percentage of students receiving Pell grants; affordability, such as average tuition, scholarships, \nand loan debt; and outcomes, such as graduation and transfer rates, graduate earnings, and advanced degrees of college \ngraduates.\" \nThe plan envisions that ratings will be tied to student aid formulas by 2018, if Congress agrees. That is a big if. It's also a year \nafter Obama's term ends. \nThere is nothing in the plan that would force states to give more funding to public higher education, one of the key cost \ndrivers in tuition. The president recognized the issue, touting a proposal that he has made before — a \"Race to the Top\" \nincentive fund of $1 billion for higher education. This fund would aim to spur state reforms and reward states that maintain \nstrong higher education funding, much as an identically named fund for K-12 education did in 2009 and 2010. But it is \nunlikely to win congressional approval. \nObama's plan highlights innovation. The president gave a major shout-out to a movement to award degrees based not on \nhow much time students spend in class but on how well they master their material, citing an experiment underway at \nSouthern New Hampshire University and one that is about to launch at the University of Wisconsin. \n\"So the idea would be if you're learning the material faster, you can finish faster, which means you pay less and you save \nmoney,\" Obama said Thursday in a speech at the University at Buffalo. This notion is indeed revolutionary in academia \nbecause most degrees are awarded based on the concept of a credit hour— which is a rough measure of the time a student \nspends doing work in and for a course. \nObama also underscored the online learning movement, which has gained steam in recent years, saying that it holds out the \npromise of reducing costs. Carnegie Mellon, Arizona State and Georgia Tech universities won coveted presidential \nmentions in the speech. So did the University of Maryland, in the fact sheet. Fans of massive open online courses, or \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028642 \nMOOCs, took heart from this. \nWhat exactly can the administration do to hasten technological innovation besides hosting datapaloozas? The fact sheet \npoints to two proposals: one that requires money, and one that doesn't. A \"First in the World\" fund of $260 million, \npresumably requiring congressional approval, would \"test and evaluate innovative approaches to higher education that \nyield dramatically better outcomes.\" Education officials liken this to a $650 million \"Investing in Innovation\" fund created \nunder the 2009 stimulus law that has been used as seed money for experiments in K-12 education. \nAnd the Education Department could cut regulatory barriers to innovation, whatever those might be. Education officials said \nFriday that they plan to solicit ideas from colleges on what government rules are hindering innovation. Many educators \nmight say that red tape gets in the way of experiments in distance learning and degree programs not organized around the \ntraditional credit hour. \nThe fact sheet asserts: \"The Department will use its authority to issue regulatory waivers for 'experimental sites' that \npromote high-quality, low-cost innovations in higher education, such as making it possible for students to get financial aid \nbased on how much they learn, rather than the amount of time they spend in class.\" \nBack to top \nMassively Online And Offline Too: How MOOCs Will Evolve In The Physical World  \nGiovanni Rodriguez — Forbes \nI was at the airport about this time last Sunday, when I overheard a conversation that's becoming quite commonplace. One \nperson was explaining to another what a MOOC was, but he couldn't remember what the letters stood for. As someone who \nregards himself as an amateur, ad-hoc, in-the-moment teacher, I felt compelled to help him out: \"Massive. Open. Online. \nCourse.\" He thanked me. He had been struggling to remember the \"open\" part of the MOOC message. And, even more \ninteresting, he had been struggling to remember the word \"course.\" \nOver the past few months, more and more clients and partners have been coming to me to deconstruct not just the acronym \nbut also the attributes of MOOCs. So often in fact that I have decided to write a short series on the subject. There are many \nthings to say about both the true impact and hype about MOOCs in the larger narrative that's emerging about disruption in \neducation. But from where I sit, what's most important to note about MOOCs in 2013 is something that the acronym does \nnot yet capture: the massive disruption we're seeing in education will be online and offline, too. \nExperience \nThere are at least three reasons for this. And each of these reasons deserves at least one post, but I'll be super brief here. \nThe first is that the online experience of MOOCs will almost certainly evolve in a way that teachers, students, and staff will \nlook to find ways to meet with one another. This will either happen by design (by intent and with care) or it will happen \norganically. Almost certainly, the producers of MOOCs will look to do this with some sense of design, while leveraging the \norganic power of networks to grow by themselves. And if you have been following the evolution of MOOCs, you already \nknow that the online experience is still a work in progress. My business colleague, Chris Bennett— a behavior designer and \ngamification expert— and I recently spoke about this: many are stuck in the old paradigm of delivering education to the \nconsumer, rather than leveraging the greatest assets of the new medium (co-creation, crowdsourcing, collaboration). By \nredesigning the online experience to become more interactive, innovators in the MOOC world will see the possibilities for \noffline experience. \nInventory \nAnother reason for thinking about physical space: while the world ponders the impact that the costs of higher education will \nhave on schools that are struggling to compete, the inventory of quality physical space that becomes available will appeal to \norganizations that need it. A couple of years ago, I had the privilege of serving as an advisor to a White House initiative that \ntraveled the country meeting with leaders in large spaces in a network of state and community colleges. As a former \ntheater producer, I was impressed with the availability and quality of these spaces. In theater — and other kinds of shared, \nquasi-spiritual, transformative experience — physical space is everything. Innovators in the MOOC world will get wise — if \nthey haven't already — to the existence of networks of spaces (there are many different networks, as I will show in a later \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028643 \narticle) and make them come alive for their clientele. \nOpportunity \nAnd I use the word clientele to make a final point: innovation in the MOOC world will not just come from educators, but from \nany organization that sees the value of massive online and offline courseware. As my own clientele have come to realize, \neducation in the 21st century is not just something you do before you become an adult but a modality of experience that \nempowers you throughout your entire life. No reason for schools to own the entire market for those kinds of experiences. \nBut I expect the most enterprising schools— especially those with great or underused physical inventory — to partner with \norganizations that now have the opportunity to rethink themselves for the education market. In the meantime, it may be time \nto reassess the MOOC acronym to make the opportunities more obvious. \"Massive Online Offline Communities\" seems \nmore like it. And unlike the online communities of the past, these communities are learning communities, driven by the new \nlifelong modality of transformative experience. Expect a land grab for branding and positioning. The disruption in education \nis just beginning, and the players are just becoming visible. \nBack to top  \nWomen and Children — Full text articles \nIndian Police Arrest Suspects in Two Gang Rapes  \nSean Mclain and Khushita Vasan — Wall Street Journal \nIndian police Sunday were holding 10 men suspected of involvement in two highly publicized gang-rape cases—one in \nurban Mumbai, the other in rural Jharkhand state—highlighting India's struggles with sexual violence. \nIn Jharkhand in eastern India, police said they had detained five suspects in connection with the rape of a policewoman by a \ngroup of men who had set up a roadblock on a highway. The attack occurred Thursday, but wasn't reported to police until \nFriday, they said. \nFive other men were in custody Sunday in the Mumbai case, in which a 22-year-old magazine intern taking photographs of \ndilapidated buildings was assaulted Thursday in an abandoned textile mill in the city, police said. \nThe attacks come as the trial of five people accused in the December gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a \nDelhi bus entered its final phase. That crime sparked nationwide demonstrations and prompted the government to \nintroduce harsher penalties for crimes against women. \nProtesters took to the streets of Mumbai on Friday to decry the assault on the magazine intern in a city that has a reputation \nas a relatively safe place for women. In 2012, the incidence of rape in the Western Indian metropolis was about half the \nnational rate, according to the National Crime Records Bureau. \n\"I've always felt much safer in Mumbai compared to other Indian cities,\" said Sanika Prabhu, a television producer from \nMumbai. \"After this incident, I feel like I don't recognize this city anymore.\" \nMumbai police said the magazine intern was with a 21-year-old male companion when she was attacked Thursday. The \nassailants tied his hands with his belt and raped the woman from 5:30 p.m. to 7 p.m., an official at N.M. Joshi police station \nsaid. Medical tests confirmed the rape, he said. \nUnder Indian law, rape victims cannot be named in media accounts. \nThere were 24,915 reported rapes in India in 2012, according to the National Crime Records Bureau, including 233 in \nMumbai. The victims in almost half the Mumbai cases were between 14 and 18 years old. \nActivists say the number of rapes is much higher, as many go unreported. India also has a poor record on convictions, with \nonly around a quarter of alleged rapists convicted in 2010. \nIn Jharkhand, police said the rape of the police constable occurred at around 1:30 a.m. on Thursday, as she and her \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028644 \nrelatives were transporting the corpse of her brother-in-law for cremation. \n\"They were accosted by five or six young men who had set up a roadblock,\" said S.N. Pradhan, a police official in Jharkhand. \nAccording to the criminal complaint, the men stole 40,000 rupees ($625) and then ordered the woman out of the vehicle. \n\"Then they took her to the bush and raped her one by one while others stood watch,\" he said. \nThe rape wasn't reported until Friday, when police—investigating reports of highway robbery—discovered a photo of a \npolicewoman near where the thefts occurred. \"The superintendent of police asked her why her photo was there and only \nthen did she report the rape,\" Mr. Pradhan said. \nBack to top \nIs there any space in the development debate for African experts? \nAndrew Quinn — Guardian blog \nAt a 2012 TEDxChange conference in Berlin, African women's development fund CEO Theo Sowa turned the spotlight on \nan uncomfortable truth: African women may be the focus of many development campaigns, but they are rarely represented \nas drivers of the discussion. \n\"When people portray us as victims, they don't want to ask us about solutions. Because people don't ask victims for \nsolutions,\" Sowa told the audience. \nOf course, experts from Africa and other parts of the developing world are pioneering solutions to a vast range of \ndevelopment challenges on everything from improving maternal health to boosting sustainable crop output. Bringing their \nperspectives to light should be an integral part of development work, particularly as the international community \ncontemplates the next steps in the global development agenda beyond the 2015 MDGs. \nCelebrity advocates, government officials and major funders all have ready-made platforms for spreading their views —the \npower of their brand is often enough to build an audience. \nBut for those without immediate recognition, the task is harder. The Aspen Institute's New Voices Fellowship, launched this \nyear with support from the Bill & Melinda Gates foundation, is one attempt to start figuring out an answer by providing both \nmedia coaching and contacts for development experts from Africa and, eventually, other parts of the developing world. \nDevelopment experts, so focused on their endless and crucial work, often neglect this area. Yet finding ways to leverage \nyours or your colleagues' public visibility is not as difficult as it sounds. Media training can be expensive, but enormously \nbeneficial. Persistence pays off. And above all, helping people to think like \"thought leaders\" can bring real results. \nOur fellows represents a cross-section of the work under way in Africa today, from a Congolese doctor seeking to build a \nhealth system in one of the remotest parts of his country to a Ghanaian tech entrepreneur devising new strategies for \nexpanding math and science education in rural communities. Each one is an expert, and each one has a story to tell. \nHelping them to craft their stories, and find an audience, have been our challenges. \nThe audience, at least initially, has been the easy part. The explosion of online and issue-driven media over the past decade \nhas created a wide range of outlets, many of which are eager to bring new voices to light. Development-focused media such \nas the Guardian's Global Development section, general interest aggregators such as the Huffington Post, and geographic \nspecialists such as AllAfrica.com and Think Africa Press all represent potential platforms for fresh writing about \ndevelopment issues. Even mainstream outlets such as CNN and Al Jazeera are welcoming new contributors for their \nopinion sections, while professional community portals such as Business Fights Poverty and the Guardian Global \nDevelopment Professionals Network can open the door to engaged specialists who care deeply about the challenges \nahead. \nAdd to this the increasingly crowded schedule of conferences and meetings ranging from the Clinton Global Initiative and \nSkoll World Forum to TEDx events held around the world and it's clear that there are a wealth of opportunities to reach \nimportant audiences with new stories. \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028645 \nCrafting those stories has proved a little trickier. While the development-focused media has expanded, the standard for \nwhat makes a compelling blog, speech or opinion piece have not: clear writing and cogent argument backed up by solid \nevidence and examples. Putting the pieces together, and injecting the right personal note to make for a truly memorable \npiece, takes work, self-confidence and practice. \nFor our first New Voices Fellowship meeting in Johannesburg in June, we set up a series of training sessions on how to \nhandle media interviews, how to behave on camera, and how to build an online presence. But the most important part of the \ncurriculum turned out to be a crash course in confidence: how to believe in the importance of what you have to say. For \nmany of our fellows, unused to thinking of themselves as \"thought leaders\", the leadership component was new territory. \nWe learned that helping the fellows define their specific areas of expertise, and to understand how that personal expertise \ncan translate into important contributions to the global development discussion, was an essential starting point. One fellow, \nan expert on maternal health from Tanzania, found new confidence in the fact that alongside her medical degrees she has \npersonal experience as an African mother. Another, who specialises in poverty alleviation in Nairobi's slums, began to \nharness his own stories about growing up in those slums to buttress his points about development in informal settlements. \nThese are exactly the types of new perspectives that will inform and enrich development policy discussions. At Aspen, we \nwill be recruiting our next class of New Voices fellows starting mid-September, and look forward to learning from and \nworking with other organisations which are committed to expanding the dialogue about what works — and what doesn't — in \nglobal development. \nAndrew Quinn is director of the New Voices Fellowship at the Aspen Institute. \nBack to top \nChild marriage campaigners in south Asia receive $23m cash injection \nMark Tran —Guardian blog \nBy the age of 17, Zeenat had been divorced three times after forced marriages. She first wed shortly after puberty to a man \nwho abused her, an experience that recurred in her subsequent marriages. \nShe became so isolated that she did not go to the hospital or ask for help. Neither had she heard of India's Protection of \nWomen from Domestic Violence Act of 2005, which made her husband's violent outbursts not just wrong, but illegal. \nSadly, her story is all too common. Every year about 10 million girls become child brides, and one in seven girls in the \ndeveloping world marries before the age of 15. \nBangladesh, Nepal and India have three of the highest rates of child marriage, with 68.7%, 56.1% and 50% respectively of \ngirls married before the age of 18. Child marriage is not just a question of poverty — although that is a critical issue — but also \nof how girls are viewed in society. \n\"Even with higher levels of income, there is the practice of child marriage,\" said Care International's gender director, \nTheresa Hwang. \"It is an issue of status; girls are valued in a lesser way. In India, girls are not seen as 'added value'. The \nissue is squarely tied to gender equality and social norms.\" \nCare USA, the US arm of the anti-poverty NGO, and the American Jewish World Service (AJWS) this week received grants \nof $7.7m (£4.9m) and $15.3m respectively from the Kendeda fund to tackle child marriage in south Asia. Both organisations \nwill use the money to support local NG0s. \nFounded 10 years ago, the Kendeda fund worked initially on environmental sustainability in the US, but last year created a \ngirls' rights portfolio. AJWS will focus on India, Care on Nepal and Bangladesh. \nAll three countries have laws against child marriage, but implementation has proved difficult. Civil child marriage laws are \nnot enforced, and religious or social customs prevail. \nIn Nepal, Care supports groups such as Chunauti, which seeks to spread its message against child marriage among \nschools and local businesses. The local NGO persuaded factories to put anti-child marriage slogans in their production \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028646 \nmaterials. It also convinced a food catering business not to cater for child marriage ceremonies. \nFor Care and AJWS, the logical route is to work through local partners familiar with regional conditions and practices, and \nbased where the pressure points are. For the local NG0s, it shows they are not working alone on a difficult problem only now \nreceiving the attention it merits. \nThe UN high-level panel appointed by Ban Ki-moon, the UN secretary general, to look at development targets to replace the \nmillennium development goals when they expire in 2015, has urged the recognition of child marriage as a key indicator of \nfemale empowerment. In another sign that child marriage is moving up the development agenda, Girls Not Brides, the global \npartnership to end child marriage, was formed in September 2011 to tackle the problem. \nEmpowerment can come through that catch-all term, livelihoods training. Groups such as Brac, the Bangladeshi NGO, for \nexample, have created clubs in Uganda where young girls learn to develop confidence through storytelling and songwriting. \nThey also learn more practical skills, from financial literacy and tailoring to agricultural work. \nBacked by AJWS, Mohammad Bazar Backward Classes Development Society in West Bengal takes a similar approach. \nThe organisation, which works with marginalised Muslim and tribal women and children in urban Kolkata, runs a school for \ngirls as well as vocational training for women in the rural area of Birbhum. \n\"We work to build girls' aspirations, promote girls' ideas of themselves when they don't have aspirations, and engage with \nkey decisionmakers — parents, teachers and religious leaders,\" said Javid Syed, Asia programme officer for AJWS. \nAJWS helped change Zeenat's life. It provided her with vocational training, allowing her to become financially independent \nand diminishing the likelihood that economic need will turn her towards another abusive marriage. If Zeenat does marry \nagain, the hope is that she will have the support of her family and the ability to leave the marriage if she chooses, in full \nknowledge of her rights. \nBack to top \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 028647",
