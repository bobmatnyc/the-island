That can only be reached if the constitution\nincludes strong guarantees of free speech, rights for women, judicial\nindependence, and cultural freedom for all ethnic and religious\ngroups.\n\nSuch a constitution would embody the wishes of most Turks. It might\nalso reinvigorate Turkey’s stalled campaign to join the European\nUnion. If Turkey becomes an EU member by the time it celebrates its\n100th anniversary in 2023, that would be Erdogan’s eternal legacy.\nTurkey is poised to become one of the most successful countries of\nthe 21st century, a model of Muslim democracy and a powerful force\nfor regional peace. Whether it will fulfill its potential depends largely\non how Erdogan handles the mandate he has just won.\n\nStephen Kinzer teaches international relations at Boston University\nand is author of “Reset: Iran, Turkey, and America’s Future.”’\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031882",
