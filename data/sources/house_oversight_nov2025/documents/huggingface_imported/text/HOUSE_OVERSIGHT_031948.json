  "text": "European stock and bond markets are already treating that as an ever-\nmore-realistic possibility, shunning even moderate levels of risk and\npushing interest rates to unsustainable levels. As far as they can see,\nMrs. Merkel and her fellow euro-zone leaders haven’t come up with\nan adequate plan, sufficient political will or sufficient cash to halt the\ncontagion. As far as we can see, they are right.\n\nThe political changes at the top of Greece and Italy are promising.\nGreece’s new prime minister, Lucas Papademos, and Mario Monti of\nItaly are internationally credible economists, committed to making\npainful but much needed reforms, including liberalizing labor\nmarkets, shrinking overgrown bureaucracies, shedding state\nproperties and rooting out corruption.\n\nGiven their training, they surely understand that their economies are\nnot now strong enough to absorb more austerity, including broad new\ntaxes or further sweeping service cuts. Mr. Papademos and Mr. Monti\nshould press their fellow European leaders for a new and better deal.\nEven with the best leadership, neither Greece nor Italy will be able,\non their own, to restore their fiscal health and help slow the spreading\nfinancial contagion. That will require substantial and immediate help\nfrom their euro-zone partners, starting with Mrs. Merkel.\n\nAn all-out effort by the European Central Bank to buy bonds, lower\ninterest rates and inject new liquidity into the markets may still calm\nthe contagion if it begins in the next few days. The bank’s new\npresident, Mario Draghi, may be willing to play this role, if Germany\nstops standing in the way.\n\nMrs. Merkel must make clear that she will support the central bank\ntaking on this expanded role. And now that new, credible leaders are\nin office in Athens and Rome, she and other euro-zone leaders need\nto meet with them and negotiate more growth-friendly reform\npackages. There is very little time left to avoid financial catastrophe.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031948",
