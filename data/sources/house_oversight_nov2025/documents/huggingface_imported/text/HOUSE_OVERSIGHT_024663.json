The various cannabinoids and terpenes in a particular can-\nnabis plant are believed to work synergistically with each other and with the human endocannabinoid\nsystem to create an effect very different from the effect any one compound would create. This phenom-\nenon may partially explain why different cannabis strains are used to treat diverse medical conditions.\n\nThere are several generally accepted examples of the entourage effect. CBD is believed to regulate\nthe psychoactive effects of THC and reduce short-term memory loss, sleepiness and paranoia that may\nbe caused by THC. Myrcene is understood to enable and hasten the psychoactive effect of THC by\nlowering resistance posed by the blood-brain barrier and increasing the THC saturation capacity of the\nCB1 receptors. Other terpenes have been shown to block endocannabinoid receptors in the brain while\npromoting bonding by endocannabinoid receptors located elsewhere in the body.\n\nMany cannabinoid and terpene formulations developed for therapeutic applications are created\nby combining extracts from multiple cannabis strains, a process known as “Frankensteining.” Some\nbelieve Frankenstein formulations are less effective than formulations developed from a single strain\nbecause the natural balance of compounds in a single strain translates to a naturally balanced effect on\nthe human body.\n\nAn understanding of entourage effects and how to effectively combine cannabinoids and terpenes\nis believed to be critical to the development of targeted cannabis therapies. Examples of cannabis-based\ntherapies being developed with specific cannabinoid-terpene profiles include acne medication contain-\ning CBD and limonene, linalool and pinene; antiseptic agents containing CBG and pinene; treatments\n\n© 2017 Ackrell Capital, LLC | Member FINRA/SIPC 27\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024663",
