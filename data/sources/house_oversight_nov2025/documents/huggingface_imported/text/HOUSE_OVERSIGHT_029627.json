  "text": "source in law enforcement, however, Epstein was allowed to submit a report by his private psychologist, Dr. Stephen Alexander of Palm\nBeach, Florida, whose information.\n\nThe Daily Beast’s second article provided details about Epstein’s systematic abuse of underage girls at his Palm Beach mansion, where\nmembers of his staff allegedly recruited and paid a parade of teenagers, to perform daily massages that\ndevolved into masturbation, groping, and sometimes full-blown sexual contact. It also revealed a monetary relationship between Epstein\nand Jean Luc Brunel, a frequent visitor to whom he gave $1 million around the same time that Brunel was starting his MC2 modeling\nagency. Some of the young girls MC2 recruited from overseas—often from Eastern Europe and South America—are known to have been\npassengers on Epstein’s private jets.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney General’s Office in Florida says that it is against policy to confirm or deny the existence of an investigation. Jeffrey\nEpstein’s lawyer, Jack Goldberger, says he has no knowledge of an ongoing probe, and he told The Daily Beast, \"Jeffrey Epstein has fully\ncomplied with all state and federal requirements that arise from the prior proceedings in Palm Beach. There are no pending civil lawsuits.\nThere are not and should not be any pending criminal investigations, given Mr. Epstein’s complete fulfillment of all the terms of his non-\nprosecution agreement with the federal government.\"\n\nConchita Sarnoff has developed multimedia communication programs for Fortune 500 companies and has produced three current-events\n\ndebate TV re rckig The Americas Forum, From Beirut to Kabul, and a segment for The Oppenheimer Report.\n\n0\n#2 bruce\n\ne@ Registered User\nx |x xX x x |x x\n\ne Group: Members\n\ne@ Posts: 11113\n\ne Joined: 12-August 08\nPosted 02 August 2010 - 12:59 AM\nThese slugs leave slime wherever they go.america is owned by these pigs.filthy pigs.\n0\n\nHis 2fe Ie fs 2s 2 24s ois 2fe 2s 2fe 2s of 24s ois 2fe ois 24s 2fs 2s 2c ois 2fe ois fe 2s fe ofc ois 2fe ois 2fe ois fe ofc ois 2fe ois fe ois fe 2s ois ofc ois 2fe 2s fe 2c ois 2c ok 2s ois 2 2k ok 2 ok\n\nThe information contained in this communication 1s\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
