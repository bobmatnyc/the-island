  "text": "connection with the nonhuman world.\nThe metaphorical and analogical\nreasoning so characteristic of religious\ninterpretations of the world is not merely\na rhetorical flourish but is, instead,\nclosely tied to general psychological\nprocesses in which self-knowledge and\nknowledge of other humans function as\nthe most readily accessible starting\npoints for inferences we make about\nhuman connections to the most\ncomprehensive and consequential forces\nat work in the nonhuman world.™\n\nAnthropomorphism’s dual\nperception of nonhuman phenomena—as\nsimultaneously both like and unlike\nhuman persons—has shaped modern\nreligious and spiritual perceptions in two\nespecially intriguing directions. In one\ncase, it has fastened on the difference\nbetween the human and the divine and\ncultivated iconoclastic perceptions of the\nspiritual in which anthropomorphic\nrepresentation is regarded as a\ndangerously misleading, albeit\nnecessary, accommodation to the\nlimitations of human reason.\" In the\nother case, it has emphasized the point of\nmetaphorical identity between the human\nand the nonhuman. Thus, an ancient\nidea held that the physical universe was\na macrocosm mirroring the human\nmicrocosm, and this included what\nliterary critics have named “the pathetic\nfallacy,” that is, a sympathetic response\nin nature to the affective states of\nhumans. The early modern political\nphilosopher Hugo Grotius (1583-1645),\nfor example, described how human\ndisobedience to divine law prompted an\nanthropomorphic emotional response\nfrom nature: “with sad motion\nwheeling, let the sky lament and\nmourn.”” In the modern history of\nreligions, these two modes of\nanthropomorphism, one accentuating\n\n106\n\nPage\n\ndifference and the other accentuating\nidentity, have varied according to social\ncircumstance, rhetorical purpose, and\npolitical ramifications. “Sinners in the\nHands of an Angry God” illustrates, in\none historical context, how\nanthropomorphic language crosses the\nboundary of the human in order to\ninterpret human ethical responsibility to\nboth the human and the nonhuman\nenvironment.\n\nThe Rhetoric of Divine Wrath\n\nClearly, Edwards’s\nanthropomorphic rhetoric destabilized in\na terrifying way the Enfield\ncongregation’s complacent perceptions\nof the world. It did so by starting from\nan assumption that Edwards and the\ncongregation shared: that humanity’s\nultimate environment should be\nconstrued, anthropomorphically, as a\ncosmic society held together by a\ncovenant that God had made with the\nwhole of creation. The sermon induced\nterror among the congregants by\ngraphically portraying their own\nresponsibility for disrupting the\nharmonious order of this all-\nencompassing society and provoking\ndivine wrath for their rebellion against\nthe covenant.\n\nThe primary evidence for this\ndivine wrath came not, however, from\nthe external orders of nature and divine\nprovidence, which Edwards imagined\nworking together to maintain the\nharmonious order of the world. Instead,\nwrath had arisen from a clash between\nthe benign will of the world and the\nrebellious human will: “there is laid in\nthe very nature of carnal men a\nfoundation for the torments of hell:\nthere are those corrupt principles, in\nreigning power in them, and in full\npossession of them, that are seeds of hell\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021352",
