The US is not seeking war\nwith the Iranian regime, but we are fully prepared to respond\nto any attack, whether by proxy, the Islamic Revolutionary\n\nGuard Corps, or regular Iranian forces.”\n\n— NSA John Bolton announcing the deployment of a carrier\nstrike group to the Persian Gulf, May 5, 2019\n\n“Our aim is not war. Our aim is a change in the behavior of the\n\nIranian leadership.”\n— Secretary of State Pompeo, May 12, 2019\n\n“President Trump has sought to put the brakes on a brewing\nconfrontation with Iran in recent days, telling the acting\ndefense secretary, Patrick Shanahan, that he does not want to\ngo to war with Iran, administration officials said, while his\nsenior diplomats began searching for ways to defuse the\n\ntensions.”\n\n— New York Times, May 16, 2019\n\n“The Fake News Media is hurting our Country with its\nfraudulent and highly inaccurate coverage of Iran. It is\nscattershot, poorly sourced (made up), and DANGEROUS. At\nleast Iran doesn’t know what to think, which at this point may\n\nvery well be a good thing!”\n— President Trump, May 17, 2019\n\n“Will the president let himself be pushed into a parlous war by John Bolton, who once buoyed the phony case on WMDs 1n Iraq?”\n— Maureen Dowd, New York Times, May 18, 2019\n\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Twitter, New York Times, Politico.\n\n4\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026948",
