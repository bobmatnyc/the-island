  "text": "The global financial crisis took all countries by surprise and was much bigger than any economy or large\ncompanies across the world. It is not really helpful for anyone to claim wisdom in hindsight. Learning the\nlesson well is the true bottom line of this crisis. I have always repeated that only the one who works is one who\nis likely to commit errors. But the most important thing 1s to learn not to repeat the same error twice. Definitely\ngaps that may be revealed through current reform efforts will be immediately addressed and rectified.\n\nBy Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper\n\nYour Highness, you have put Emiratization on top of the country’s development\npriorities. Over the years, the UAE population has grown significantly to the extent that\nexpat residents have become absolute majority. Meanwhile, number of private sector\ncompanies has significantly increased as well. How do you see this impacting the UAE\nnationals’ job opportunities? Do you believe it might be necessary to expand the\nEmiratization plan to cover a larger portion of the private sector companies?\n\nThe Emiratization plan is primarily based on training and qualifying UAE nationals, equipping them with all\nnecessary tools and competencies and supporting them to confidently compete in the job market. I am positive\nthat most of the private sector companies prefer to recruit UAE nationals as part of their Corporate Social\nResponsibilities. Also salaries of UAE nationals — however high they may appear to be - are far less than those\nof expats. Employing a UAE national will open the door for more interaction with government departments and\nlocal customers, who are eventually the highest spenders. If some companies fall short of their responsibilities\ntoward the local workforce, then the government will intervene through a set of measures and incentives to\nencourage these companies to live up to the expected level of responsibility.\n\nBy Ro’ya Al Iqtesadiah newspaper\n\nMany countries have applauded the UAE’s hospitality and praised the level of respect it\nshows to the expat communities and the freedom it offers them to lead their business and\nsocial lives in perfect ease. This encouraged many expats to reside in the UAE for long\nperiod of time, evolving the same habits and traditions of the local community as well as\nsignificant loyalty to this country. Some of those expats felt optimistic about recent\nannouncements made by some real estate companies that property buyers in certain\nprojects in Dubai or Ajman will be offered “permanent UAE residency.” Other\ncompanies have completely closed the door of speculation regarding the same issue. How\ndoes the government perceive=2 Othe “Permanent Residency” promise? And are there\nany eventual plans to adopt it in the UAE?\n\nOffering residency is absolutely far beyond the jurisdiction of any real estate company. It is a sovereign issue\ngoverned by laws and regulations. But I wonder if one buys property in London, Paris, Cairo, or Beirut does this\nmean obtaining a permanent residency there? We are very keen to ensure convenient conditions for expat\nproperty owners. However, we will be issuing a new law that includes a long multi-visit permit soon.\n\nDALAL ABU GHAZALA, Al Hayat Newspaper\n\nThe UAE has proven remarkable capability in managing previous crises, including the\nGulf First or Second Wars and 9/11 events in the US. What are the steps endorsed by the\ncountry’s supreme leadership to overcome the current financial crisis? And do these\nmeasures include re-evaluating the UAE’s strategy and its plans for the coming few\nyears?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024949",
