  "text": "did not extinguish innovation as efficiently as it was extinguished among our forebears in\nprehistory for thousands of centuries.”®\n\nThat is why I say that prehistoric people, at least, were barely people. Both before\nand after becoming perfectly human both physiologically and in their mental potential,\nthey were monstrously inhuman in the actual content of their thoughts. I’m not referring\nto their crimes or even their cruelty as such: Those are all too human. Nor could mere\ncruelty have reduced progress that effectively. Things like “the thumbscrew and the\nstake / For the glory of the Lord” ?° were for reining in the few deviants who had\nsomehow escaped mental standardization, which would normally have taken effect long\nbefore they were in danger of inventing heresies. From the earliest days of thinking\nonward, children must have been cornucopias of creative ideas and paragons of critical\nthought— otherwise, as I said, they could not have learned language or other complex\nculture. Yet, as Jacob Bronowski stressed in The Ascent of Man:\n\nFor most of history, civilisations have crudely ignored that enormous\npotential... . [C]hildren have been asked simply to conform to the image\nof the adult... . The girls are little mothers in the making. The boys are\nlittle herdsmen. They even carry themselves like their parents.\n\nBut of course, they weren’t just “asked” to ignore their enormous potential and\nconform faithfully to the image fixed by tradition: They were somehow trained to be\npsychologically unable to deviate from it. By now, it is hard for us even to conceive of\nthe kind of relentless, finely tuned oppression required to reliably extinguish, in\neveryone, the aspiration to progress and replace it with dread and revulsion at any novel\nbehavior. In such a culture, there can have been no morality other than conformity and\nobedience, no other identity than one’s status in a hierarchy, no mechanisms of\ncooperation other than punishment and reward. So everyone had the same aspiration in\nlife: to avoid the punishments and get the rewards. In a typical generation, no one\ninvented anything, because no one aspired to anything new, because everyone had\nalready despaired of improvement being possible. Not only was there no technological\ninnovation or theoretical discovery, there were no new worldviews, styles of art, or\ninterests that could have inspired those. By the time individuals grew up, they had in\neffect been reduced to Als, programmed with the exquisite skills needed to enact that\nstatic culture and to inflict on the next generation their inability even to consider doing\notherwise.\n\nA present-day AI is not a mentally disabled AGI, so it would not be harmed by\nhaving its mental processes directed still more narrowly to meeting some predetermined\ncriterion. “Oppressing” Siri with humiliating tasks may be weird, but it is not immoral\nnor does it harm Siri. On the contrary, all the effort that has ever increased the\ncapabilities of Als has gone into narrowing their range of potential “thoughts.” For\nexample, take chess engines. Their basic task has not changed from the outset: Any\nchess position has a finite tree of possible continuations; the task is to find one that leads\nto a predefined goal (a checkmate, or failing that, a draw). But the tree is far too big to\n\n8 Matt Ridley, in The Rational Optimist, rightly stresses the positive effect of population on the rate of\nprogress. But that has never yet been the biggest factor: Consider, say, ancient Athens versus the rest of the\nworld at the time.\n\n*° Alfred, Lord Tennyson, Zhe Revenge (1878).\n\n87\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016307",
