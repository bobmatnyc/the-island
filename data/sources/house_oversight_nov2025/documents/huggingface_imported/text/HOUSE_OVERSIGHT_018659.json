Some people become incredibly non-\nverbal, or vague and confused, or giggly, or all of the above. For this reason, some people\ninclude later follow-ups (like a next-day phone call) under the umbrella of \"aftercare\" --\nthe goal is to allow the post-S&M time to be calming and un-challenging, and then talk\nthings through when everyone's head is clearer. Processing things thoroughly after an\nS&M encounter is really important, especially if the people involved are planning to do it\nagain. It's important for two reasons: it helps the people involved get a better sense of\nwhat they want and don't want; and it helps them learn more about how to communicate\nwith their partners.\n\nRecently, I was privileged to give a partner his first heavy S&M experience. Afterwards,\nwhen he was coming out of it, he said to me: \"No one has ever touched me so deeply, so\nfast before.\" I lay with him, listening. I'm pretty sure I did a good job helping him pick up\nthe pieces, but when I try to figure out what I did, I have trouble describing it.\n\nSo I wouldn't know how to give a step-by-step \"how to\" for aftercare, but I can offer\nsome thoughts. For one thing, the person who was dominant during the encounter is\nusually the person who runs the aftercare, too. When I'm in the dominant position, the\nmessage I try to get across during aftercare is along these lines: \"I'm here, I'm listening, I\ncare about you, you're safe with me, and you can take all the time you need.”\n\nIn the submissive position, I'm often too busy processing to think carefully about what\nmessage I'm getting across to my partner. But sometimes I do get the sense that he's\nconfused or anxious or needs some feedback, at which point I try to get across a message\nalong these lines: \"I care about you and I'm so grateful to you for taking on that power\njust now. If you need to talk, we will do that when I'm more alert. But for now, let's\nplease just be here together and establish our closeness.”\n\nAnd when I'm switching -- or when the power dynamic is otherwise unclear -- well. I\nguess I try to get across a combination of those messages.\n\nThe Boundaries of S&M Intimacy\n\nI used to be more willing to do S&M \"on the first date,” when I barely knew my partner.\nThat's changed for two reasons. Firstly, I've become much warier of doing S&M without\na strong foundation to the relationship. I've been lucky, because my partners have treated\nme so well, even the casual ones. (As more stories of S&M and abuse become public, I\nrealize more and more how lucky I've been.) But I don't ever want to be in a position\nwhere I do intense S&M and I can't rely on my partner afterwards; and the best way to\nbuild a reliable foundation is to spend lots of time together before we get into anything\ndeep.\n\nSecondly, I've become more aware of how quickly S&M can affect me. It's entirely\npossible to do excellent, intense S&M with someone I can't trust. And if that happens,\nthen boom: I'll be intensely bonded to him, yet unable to trust him. It's not a good place to\nbe. There are some kinds of S&M that feel light or even impersonal to me, but when I do\nthings that feel intense... the bond forms so fast, and it's so incredibly strong.
