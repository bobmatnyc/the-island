  "text": "But today, in Amman, as in almost every Arab capital, independent\nmeetings and debates about how to move forward are taking place in\nart galleries, think tanks, salons, ordinary households, and, most\nsignificantly, online. A region often depicted as “backward” is\ndebating its destiny both face-to-face and across social networks\nevery second of every day.\n\nYet tweeting is no substitute for thought. Indeed, the events and\npersonalities that have so far gained attention seem to fill the void\nwhere the declarations of freedom and treatises on rights — where\nthe ideas — should be.\n\nThe result is the confusion that we now see. Contradictions abound.\nGovernments across the region have been identified as the problem,\nand yet the state is being called upon to address a social and political\nagenda that has not yet been fully defined. We are seeing the birth of\na more democratic spirit among the region’s peoples, but a\ncorresponding sense of democratic responsibility remains\nunderdeveloped.\n\nNo matter how influential new media have been, they cannot replace\nthe need for a region-wide “manifesto for change” that all who seek\nfreedom can embrace. Any such manifesto must address the two\nelephants in the room — Palestine and the price of oil — as well as the\nextent to which regional water and energy resources, now rapidly\ndepleting, should be shared. (Here, I and experts from around the\nworld have been calling for the creation of a Supranational\nCommission for Water and Energy to ensure the kind of sustainable\nresource management that the Strategic Foresight Group has labeled\n“Blue Peace.”’)\n\nOf course, generating ideas is easier said than done. By limiting free\nspeech and forcing millions of young people to stay at home without\njobs, the only public space left for many people happens to be virtual.\nArab governments switched their people off, so their people migrated\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030161",
