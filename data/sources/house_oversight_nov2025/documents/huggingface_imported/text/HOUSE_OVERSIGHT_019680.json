  "text": "192 | HOW AMERICA LOST ITS SECRETS\n\nwrote in his book that the ability of Russian intelligence to conceal\nthis penetration for more than half a century “broke the record for\nsecret keeping.”\n\nThis Russian ability to penetrate U.S. intelligence was not entirely\ndefeated by America’s implementation of more sophisticated secu-\nrity procedures, such as the polygraph examination and extensive\nbackground checks. In 1995, eleven years before Snowden joined it,\nthe CIA’s inspector general completed a study of the KGB’s use of\nfalse defectors to mislead the U.S. government from the end of the\nCold War in the late 1980s through the mid-1g990s. It found Rus-\nsia had dispatched at least half a dozen double agents who provided\nmisleading information to their CIA case officers.\n\nBecause the KGB operation went undetected for nearly a decade,\nthe disinformation prepared in Moscow had been incorporated into\nreports (which had a distinctive blue stripe to signify their impor-\ntance) that had been provided to Ronald Reagan, George H. W. Bush,\nand Bill Clinton. Even more shocking, in tracing the path of this\ndisinformation, the inspector general found that the “senior CIA\n\n© officers responsible for these reports had known that some of their ©\nsources for this information were controlled by Russian intelli-\ngence,” yet they did not inform the president and officials receiving\nthe blue-striped reports that they included Russian misinformation.\nWhat the CIA director John Deutch called “an inexcusable lapse”\nalso reflected a form of institutional willful blindness in U.S. intel-\nligence, borne out of a bureaucratic fear of career embarrassment so\nwell described in Le Carré’s spy novels. Detecting intelligence fail-\nures has, if anything, become even more difficult in the age of the\nanonymous Internet.\n\nThe Snowden breach demonstrated the NSA had few if any fail-\nsafe defenses against would-be leakers of communications intelli-\ngence. In the new domain of cyber warfare, conventional defensive\nrules do not apply. “There are no rivers or hills up here. It’s all flat.\nAll advantage goes to the attacker,” General Hayden said in an inter-\nview in 2015 with the publisher of The Wall Street Journal. His point\nwas that because there are no defensive positions, the United States\nin cyber warfare must rely on an aggressive offensive. If fully suc-\ncessful, such an offensive would so deeply penetrate the defenses of\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 192 ® 9/29/16 5:51 Pa | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019680",
