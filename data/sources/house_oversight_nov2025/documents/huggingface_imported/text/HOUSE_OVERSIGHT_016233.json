  "text": "to spend time with physicists, the reason being that they think about the universe, 1.e.\neverything. And no physicist was reputed to be articulate as Feynman. I couldn’t wait to\nmeet him. I accepted. That said, I am not a scientist, and I had never entertained the idea\nof getting on a stage and delivering a “lecture” of any kind, least of all a commentary on\nan obscure mathematical theory in front of a group identified as the world’s most\ninteresting thinkers. Only upon my arrival in Big Sur did I find out the reason for my\nvery late invitation. “When is Feynman’s talk?” I asked at the desk. “Oh, didn’t Alan\nWatts tell you? Richard is ill and has been hospitalized. You’re his replacement. And, by\nthe way, what’s the title of your keynote lecture?”\n\nI tried to make myself invisible for several days. Alan Watts, realizing that I was\navoiding the podium, woke me up one night with a 3am knock on the door of my room. I\nopened the door to find him standing in front of me wearing a monk’s robe with a hood\nthat covering much of his face. His arms extended, he held a lantern in one hand, and a\nmagnum of scotch on the other.\n\n“John”, he said in a deep voice with a rich aristocratic British accent, “you are a\nphony.” “And, John”, he continued, Iam a phony. But John, Iam a real phony!”\n\nThe next day I gave my lecture, entitled \"Einstein, Gertrude Stein, Wittgenstein,\nand Frankenstein.\" Einstein: the revolution in 20\" century physics; Gertrude Stein: the\nfirst writer who made integral to her work the idea of an indeterminate and discontinuous\nuniverse. Words represented neither character nor activity: A rose is a rose is a rose, and\na universe is a universe is a universe. ); Wittgenstein: the world as limits of language.\n“The limits of my language mean the limits of my world”. The end of the distinction\nbetween observer and observed. Frankenstein: Cybernetics AI, robotics, all the essayists\nin this volume.\n\nThe lecture had unanticipated consequences. Among the participants at the AUM\nConference were several authors of #1 New York Times bestsellers, yet no one there had\na literary agent. And I realized that all were engaged in writing a genre of book both\nunnamed and unrecognized by New York publishers. Since I had an MBA from\nColombia Business School, and a series of relative successes in business, I was\ndragooned into becoming an agent, initially for Gregory Bateson and John Lilly, whose\nbooks I sold quickly, and for sums that caught my attention, thus kick-starting my career\nas a literary agent.\n\nI never did meet Richard Feynman.\n\nThe Long AI Winters\n\nThis new career put me in close touch with most of the AI pioneers, and over the decades\nI rode with them on waves of enthusiasm, and into valleys of disappointment.\n\nIn the early ‘80s the Japanese government mounted a national effort to advance\nAI. They called it the 5“ Generation; their goal was to change the architecture of\ncomputation by breaking “the von Neumann bottleneck”, by creating a massively parallel\ncomputer. In so doing, they hoped to jumpstart their economy and become a dominant\nworld power in the field. In1983, the leader of the Japanese 5“ Generation consortium\ncame to New York for a meeting organized by Heinz Pagels, the president of the New\nYork Academy of Sciences. I had a seat at the table alongside the leaders of the 1“\ngeneration, Marvin Minsky and John McCarthy, the 2\"! generation, Edward Feigenbaum\n\n13\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016233",
