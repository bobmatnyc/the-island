  "text": "breakdown of her pets, measurements, and favorite foods (e.g., swordfish). If all Bangalorians are like\nHoney, I pity Americans about to graduate college. They’re up against a hungry, polite, Excel-proficient\nIndian army.\n\nIN FACT, in the next few days, I outsource a whole mess of online errands to Asha (from the personal\nservice YMII): paying my bills, getting stuff from drugstore.com, finding my son a Tickle Me Elmo.\n(Actually, the store was out of Tickle Me Elmos, so Asha bought a Chicken Dance Elmo—good\ndecision.) I had her call Cingular to ask about my cell-phone plan. I’m just guessing, but I bet her call\nwas routed from Bangalore to New Jersey and then back to a Cingular employee in Bangalore, which\nmakes me happy for some reason.\n\nIT’S THE fourth morning of my new, farmed-out life, and when I flip on my computer, my e-mail\ninbox is already filled with updates from my overseas aides. It’s a strange feeling having people work for\nyou while you sleep. Strange, but great. ’'m not wasting time while I drool on my pillow; things are\ngetting done.\n\nHONEY IS my protector. Consider this: For some reason, the Colorado Tourism Board e-mails me all\nthe time. (Most recently, they informed me about a festival in Colorado Springs featuring the world’s\nmost famous harlequin.) I request that Honey gently ask them to stop with the press releases. Here’s what\nshe sent:\n\nDear All,\n\nJacobs often receives mails from Colorado news, too often. They are definitely interesting topics.\nHowever, these topics are not suitable for “Esquire.”\n\nFurther, we do understand that you have taken a lot of initiatives working on these articles and\nsending it to us. We understand. Unfortunately, these articles and mails are too time consuming to be\nread.\n\nCurrently, these mails are not serving right purpose for both of us. Thus, we request to stop sending\nthese mails.\n\nWe do not mean to demean your research work by this.\nWe hope you understand too.\nThanking you,\nHoney K B\n\nThat is the best rejection notice in journalism history. It’s exceedingly polite, but there’s a little\n\nundercurrent of indignation. Honey seems almost outraged that Colorado would waste the valuable time\nof Jacobs.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013872",
