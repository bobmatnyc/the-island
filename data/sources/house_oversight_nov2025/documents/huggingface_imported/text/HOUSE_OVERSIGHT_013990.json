There are almost seven billion of us. This isn’t a\n\nproblem, of course, once you realize that life is neither a problem to be solved nor a game to be won.\n\nIf you are too intent on making the pieces of a nonexistent puzzle fit, you miss out on all the real fun.\nThe heaviness of success-chasing can be replaced with a serendipitous lightness when you recognize that\nthe only rules and limits are those we set for ourselves.\n\nSo be bold and don’t worry about what people think. They don’t do it that often anyway.\n\nTwo years ago, I was forwarded the following poem—originally written by child psychologist David\nL. Weatherford—by a close friend. He quit his own deferred-life plan after reading it, and I hope you\nwill do the same. Here it is.\n\nSLOW DANCE\n\nHave you ever watched kids\nOn a merry-go-round?\n\nOr listened to the rain\nSlapping on the ground?\n\nEver followed a butterfly’s erratic flight?\nOr gazed at the sun into the fading night?\n\nYou better slow down.\nDon’t dance so fast.\n\nTime is short.\nThe music won’t last.\n\nDo you run through each day\nOn the fly?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013990",
