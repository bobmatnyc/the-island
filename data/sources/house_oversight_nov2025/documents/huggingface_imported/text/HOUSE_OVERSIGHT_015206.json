  "text": "outrageous sex scene.’ Paul actually uses Marilena’ s pussy as an echo\nchamber!”\n\nNow, in his regular voice, he is telling our workshop of the need to\n\n“approach the body, not for sexual release, but for every single inch of\nthis body, the groundwork, the geography of pleasure. Can anybody name\none spot on your body that is not capable of receiving pleasure?”\nNobody can. Later, the entire audience, seated around the perimeter of\nthis extra-large room, is instructed to come stand in the center area and\nface their partners. | start to slide out, but not inconspicuously enough.\nRamana Das, who knows me from a previous incarnation, calls out, “There\ngoes Paul Krassner. Are you afraid to participate?”\n\n“I’m here as a journalist.”\n“Ah, he can’ t participate because he’ s a journalist. See how\neverybody has excuses.”\n\nSuddenly I’ m saddled with a dose of New Age guilt, as though |\nhave aborted my inner child. Meanwhile, there’ s a lovely blonde who\ndoesn’ t have a partner, and now |’ m tempted to participate, but some\nguy who’ s also without a partner links up with her. Unexpectedly, my\nguilt changes to jealousy. Just a slight pang of jealousy, mind you, but a\n\nterrible taboo in this particular world.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015206",
