  "text": "The Special Counsel's office, nearly leak-proof since its inception\nmore than a year ago, can appear to be operating in some parallel\nuniverse unmoved by the every-day political turmoil. But in the course\nof conversations I've had researching a new book on President Trump\nand the forces arrayed against him, it has become clear that Robert\nMueller and his office are already preparing for a life or death\nconfrontation with the President and the mother of all constitutional\ncrises.\n\nOver the last several months the Mueller office has prepared a\npossible indictment of the president on charges related to obstruction of\njustice and devised a legal strategy to navigate the inevitable fallout\nfrom such an indictment.\n\nMy discussions have been with both White House advisors and\npeople close to the investigation—that is, sources on both sides of the\npossible conflict. No source involved in this story would speak on the\nrecord. But in broad-strokes each side's understanding matches the\naccount provided to me by the other side.\n\nThe Special Counsel has in place a set of allegations, proposed\ncharges, and an aggressive legal theory to support the indictment of the\npresident on obstruction charges. In the last few weeks, as the President\nhas indulged his pardon authority, the Mueller team has also developed\na legal basis to oppose what the Special Counsel believes will be a likely\npardon of former National Security Advisor, Michael Flynn—who had\npreviously struck a plea bargain which could include his testimony\nagainst the President—and what it believes to be another step in the\nPresident's obstruction efforts.\n\nAt this point, the case for indictment has, in effect, a judge of one,\nsince the Mueller team must get the approval of Deputy Attorney\nGeneral Rod Rosenstein to proceed. As recently as April, Rosenstein\npublicly declared that the President was not a target, but this may have\nbeen a kind of fig leaf: technically the President does not become a\nformal target until Rosenstein agrees to designate him as one. It may\nalso illustrate a conflict between the Deputy Attorney General and the\ninvestigators he has overseen since the recusal of Attorney General Jeff\nSessions from the Russia-related investigation—though, according to\none source, Mueller believes he does have the support of his boss.\n\nThe proposed indictment would be all the more controversial\nbecause it finds the entire narrative of the case for obstruction in plain\nsight. Almost nothing in it-involves new information; rather, it takes\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030248",
