The Game: All Things Trump

Andres Serrano

"In the history of science the collector of specimens
preceded the zoologist and followed the exponents of
natural theology and magic..... However lowly, the work
of the collector must be done, before he can proceed to
the higher scientific tasks of classification, analysis,
experiment and theory making."

Aldous Huxley from Heaven and Hell
