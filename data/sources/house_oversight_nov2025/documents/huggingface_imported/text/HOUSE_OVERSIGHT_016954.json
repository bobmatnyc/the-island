  "text": "Alison Gopnik is an international leader in the field of children’s learning and\ndevelopment and was one of the founders of the field of “theory of mind.” She has\nspoken of the child brain as a “powerful learning computer,” perhaps from personal\nexperience. Her own Philadelphia childhood was an exercise in intellectual\ndevelopment. “Other families took their kids to see The Sound of Music or Carousel; we\nsaw Racine ’s Phaedra and Samuel Beckett’s Endgame,” she has recalled. “Our family\nread Henry Fielding’s 18th-century novel Joseph Andrews out loud to each other around\nthe fire on camping trips.”\n\nLately she has invoked Bayesian models of machine learning to explain the\nremarkable ability of preschoolers to draw conclusions about the world around them\nwithout benefit of enormous data sets. “I think babies and children are actually more\nconscious than we are as adults,” she has said. “They’re very good at taking in lots of\ninformation from lots of different sources at once.” She has referred to babies and young\nchildren as “the research and development division of the human species.” Not that she\ntreats them coldly, as if they were mere laboratory animals. They appear to revel in her\ncompany, and in the blinking, thrumming toys in her Berkeley lab. For years after her\nown children had outgrown it, she kept a playpen in her office.\n\nHer investigations into just how we learn, and the parallels to the deep-learning\nmethods of AI, continues. “Tt turns out to be much easier to simulate the reasoning of a\nhighly trained adult expert than to mimic the ordinary learning of every baby,” she says.\n“Computation is still the best—indeed, the only—scientific explanation we have of how a\nPhysical object like a brain can act intelligently. But, at least for now, we have almost no\nidea at all how the sort of creativity we see in children is possible.”\n\n151\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016954",
