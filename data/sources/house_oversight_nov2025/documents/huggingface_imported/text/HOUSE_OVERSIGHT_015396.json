  "text": "Ram Dass and | went to a health-food restaurant, where we discovered\nthat we shared something in common: we were all practicing celibacy —\nLarry at the suggestion of Dick Gregory, Althea by extension, Ram Dass for\nspiritual purposes, and me just for the sheer perversity of it.\n\nWhen Larry got shot down south by a racist nut because Hust/er had\na black naked model, Althea had transformed the Coca-Cola Suite at\nEmory University Hospital into her office, where she was now studying the\nSlides of the irreverent “Jesus and the Adulteress” feature. Dick Gregory\nwas there, and he said, “This scares me\" He was concerned about\nreaction in the Bible Belt, notwithstanding the fact that Hust/er's research\ndepartment had already made certain that the text followed the Bible.\n\nAnd now Althea was checking for any sexism that might have\nslipped past the male editors’ limited consciousness. The spread was\nalready in page forms, but not yet collated into the magazine, and there\nwas still a gnawing dilemma about whether or not to publish it.\n\nThe marketing people were aghast at the possibility that wholesalers\nwould refuse to distribute an issue of the magazine with such a blatantly\nblasphemous feature. Althea and | voted to publish. Gregory and editor\nBruce David voted not to publish. “lI’ m against it,” he said, “because\n\nwe're this is an issue that just simply will not be distributed.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015396",
