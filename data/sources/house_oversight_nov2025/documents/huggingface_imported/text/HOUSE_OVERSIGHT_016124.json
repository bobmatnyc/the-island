  "text": "Ambitious diversification agenda is not without risks\n\nDiversification initiatives will require material participation from the private sector.\nVested interests and the large bureaucracy could act as a dampener on timely reform\nimplementation going forward. The large size of the NTP program may mean some of\nits outcomes are internally inconsistent, in our view. Cultural and entertainment changes\ncould be opposed by conservative or clerical factions. Slippage could occur due to\nexecution risk or reform fatigue, particularly due to the socio-economic impact of fiscal\nconsolidation. Any material changes to subsidies or wages could be difficult to\nimplement in the absence of a social safety net. While fiscal consolidation measures are\nunprecedented in scope, they appear too ambitious or difficult to reach and may leave a\nfinancing gap. As such, the measures may still fall short if oil prices do not stabilize,\nwhich suggests a need for a less aggressive energy policy going forward, in our view.\n\nGovernment leaders continue to show focus on delivery\n\nThe US visit of Deputy Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and finalization of various\nMemoranda of Understanding (MoUs) with prominent US corporates helps provide a\nhighly visible anchor for foreign investment and instil business confidence in regards to\ngovernment focus. It also helps boost the profile of the Deputy Crown Prince both\ndomestically and internationally. This is in line with our view that the government is\nlikely to target rapid implementation of several ‘low-hanging’ reforms to spearhead the\nprogram and boost confidence. Energy sector liberalization could also serve as another\nhighly visible anchor to the reform program, in our view.\n\nTable 5: Announced US corporates plans during the US visit of the Saudi Deputy Crown Prince\n\nCompany Sector Outcome\n\nSix Flags Entertainment Company has been allowed to operate in Saudi Arabia\nPfizer Pharmaceuticals Company has been awarded a direct investment license\n3M Manufacturing Company has been awarded a direct investment license\nDow Chemical Chemicals Company has been awarded a direct investment license\nMicrosoft IT Memorandum of Understanding signed\n\nCisco IT Memorandum of Understanding signed\n\nApple IT Discussions on entry to Saudi market possibly under way\n\nSource: Press reports, Saudi Press Agency, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nDiversification drive is a step in the right direction\n\nThe comprehensive medium-term diversification drive introduced by the NTP follows\nthe typical macro template, in our view. We discuss in a later section diversification\nlessons from Malaysia and Norway and conclude that the NTP contains elements from\nthese successful case studies. In particular, it a) identifies key sectors with relatively\nhigh growth potential (mining, petrochemicals, manufacturing, retail and wholesale\ntrade, religious and other forms of tourism, healthcare, real estate and finance); b), it\nstarts to articulate supportive public sector industrial strategies, including through\nlocalization policies; and, c) it seeks to foster higher-value added in the economy\nthrough enhancements to processes, products and organizations.\n\n14 GEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 3S Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016124",
