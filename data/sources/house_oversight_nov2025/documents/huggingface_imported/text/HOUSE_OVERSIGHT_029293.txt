How’s all in our crazy world?

I’m in NY until August 31 (then again, after Beijing, Sept. 25 — Oct. 14). If you are in town, meet?

When convenient, I’d like you to meet Peter Getzels, Closer To Truth producer/director (I’ve worked with
Peter for 12 years); he would very much like to meet you in person, describe the Radical Breakthroughs
process in detail, get your feedback. He would come up from DC. We can always do Skype, of course, but
Peter would appreciate to meet in person early in the process. Breakthroughs is a Big Project, big opportunity
for impact. All are truly excited.

Below are highlights of Breakthroughs progress.

Attached is latest CNN on trade war and below are links (caution: a few weeks old is ancient history in Trump
time).

Love to discuss stuff.

Radical Breakthrough Development Work

* Research on each of the 13 episodes is ongoing and we are moving towards creating a short list of the top
contributors per episode (with some contributors in multiple episodes).

* We are aggregating the top contributors around 4 to 5 central locations, such as SF Bay Area, LA, Chicago,
Boston, New York, Santa Fe, London, Oxford, and Cambridge for the main shoots.

* We are creating a short list of locations for the secondary shoot - i.e. the more observational shoots on
specific labs and research facilities, such as the Music Lab at McGill, the Sleep Lab at Harvard.

* We are planning a recce in the autumn to assess locations and meet some of the key contributors.
