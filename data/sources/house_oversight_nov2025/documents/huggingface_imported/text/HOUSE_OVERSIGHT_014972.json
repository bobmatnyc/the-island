Monetise\ncorrelation through EU bank dispersion\nwe estimate 68% of the\n20 June 2017\nUnauthorized redistribution of this report is prohibited. This report is intended for amanda.ens@baml.com\nUS\nExtract alpha from summer SPX range as policy and positioning “collar” equities\nWith the Federal Reserve last week appearing more emboldened to normalize monetary\npolicy, risk asset bears have come out in force. While we agree that a changing Fed\nreaction function is likely not supportive of substantial equity upside, we think the\n“Yellen put” still exists, albeit with a lower strike. Hence, we see monetary policy as\nproviding a near-term “collar” (long put/short call) on a US equity market already prone\nto getting trapped in record-tight trading ranges. Further impetus for a summer rangetrade\nshould come from (i) fiscal policy, as gridlock caps equity upside but policy hope\nfloors the downside, and (ii) positioning, where the risk of continued “fragility events”\n(potentially exacerbated by stretched quant fund/short vol positioning) meets cashed-up\ninvestors still accustomed to buying dips. As a risk-limited range trade, we like buying\nin-the-money down and out puts on the S&P. For example, an SPX Sep 2475 put that\nknocks out at 2300 (6% OTM) indicatively costs 70bps (spot ref 2451), a 60% discount\nto the 2475 / 2300 put spread.\nEurope\nLong EU banks dispersion: Buy Dec17 call on a basket, sell worst-of call\nWe recommend positioning for greater dispersion in EU bank sector returns via buying a\nDec17 105% call on an equally-weighted basket of Santander, BNP, ING, Intesa and\nDeutsche Bank, part-financed by selling a worst-of call on the same basket for 1.8%\n(net) indic., as: 1) improving macro/earnings, sensitivity to rates and regulatory\nheadwinds are likely to lead to greater differentiation within banks, 2) the entry point is\nattractive given historically low implied vol (13 th 8y+ percentile) and high implied\ncorrelation (81% bid vs latest 6M realised correl of 66%), 3) historical risk-reward at\ncurrent pricing is attractive (avg. P&L of +8.4% when positive vs -1.8% when negative),\nand 4) the trade can be considered as a cheap call on EU equities as it has a similar\npayoff profile but with greater benefit relative to its cost.\nAsia\nBuy depressed China vs. US risks through corridor variance spreads\nAs global central banks have taken on more hawkish tones, the uncertainty surrounding\npolicy tightening will be more positive for EM volatility than for DM volatility.\nAdditionally, our strategists have a more bearish outlook for the Chinese banking sector\n(which makes up a majority of the HSCEI index) amid rapidly rising leverage, complex\nshadow banking, and excessive home price inflation. Since we believe the global\nsynchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCEI volatility more than SPX volatility,\nwe recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points, a 3 vol\npoint discount to a vanilla variance spread. The entry point is attractive as the HSCEI-\nSPX 18-month variance swap spread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year\ntrading range, the trade has a positive carry, and it benefits during China risk-off events.\n>> Employed by a non-US affiliate of MLPF&S and is not registered/qualified as a research analyst under\nthe FINRA rules.\nRefer to \"Other Important Disclosures\" for information on certain BofA Merrill Lynch entities that take\nresponsibility for this report in particular jurisdictions.\nBofA Merrill Lynch does and seeks to do business with issuers covered in its research reports.

Breakeven rates of inflation narrowed following the Fed communications\ndue to tighter monetary conditions in the face of slowing US economic data, and risk\nasset bears responded in force, suggesting that Janet Yellen had “broken up” with\ninvestors and that it would be prudent to sell “before it’s too late”.\nWe agree that the changing reaction function of the Fed is likely not supportive of\nfurther substantial US equity upside and may be viewed as the Fed now providing a\nshort call option on the S&P 500. However, in our view, it is premature to conclude\nfrom last week’s developments that the “Yellen put” is dead. We see its strike as\ndeclining but would not underestimate Yellen’s dovish inclinations in a shock or the\ncapacity for the Fed to still remain credibly on hold as long as the US economy is not\n“running hot”.\nIn short, we see monetary policy as now providing a “collar” (long put / short call) on a\nUS equity market that has already shown a propensity over the past year for getting\ntrapped in record tight trading ranges. 1 Other factors may also conspire to create a\nsummer range-trade for US equities, namely (i) fiscal policy, where gridlock likely caps\nequity upside but lingering policy hope floors the downside, and (ii) positioning, where\nthe risk of continued “fragility events” (potentially exacerbated by stretched quant\nfund/short vol positioning) meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buying dips.\nTug of war between fragile market/stretched positioning and cashed-up dip-buyers\nAs we have noted recently, US equities have displayed a historically unusual tendency to\njump rapidly from calm to stress and back (“fragility”), with the recent Tech sell-off and\nrebound the latest example. For example, in the past year, the S&P 500 has seen\n5sigma declines (3 in total—Brexit, Sep-16, May-17) occur 20x more frequently than\nover the prior 90 years or so. The increased frequency of these “fragility events” is in\npart due to vol failing to remain high post a spike as equity market participants continue\nto aggressively “buy the dip” and in the process reset vol lower.\nHistorically low vol alongside consistently upward trending equity markets and low cross\nasset correlations could be creating stretched positioning across markets. For example,\nupward trending equities on historically low vol may be pushing CTA equity positioning\nto near record levels (Chart 7). Risk parity portfolios could be increasing their leverage\ndue to low vol as well as low cross asset correlation (Chart 8). And lastly, inverse VIX\nETPs have seen increased open interest as performance has swelled on the back of\ncontinued declines in vol and attractive term structure risk premia (Chart 9).\nShould vol spike again alongside a reversal in equity price momentum and a rise in cross\nasset correlations, then unwinds from these strategies could exacerbate market fragility.\nHowever, this must be weighed against an investor base that has plenty of cash on hand\n(Chart 10) and their potentially fickle but still-intact tendency to view any equity market\ndip as an alpha opportunity.\n1\nFor example, the Dow Jones Industrial Average traded in its tightest trading range in over\n110 years in Jan-17; this followed a record in the S&P 500 ending Sep-16 for the longest\nstretch of trading within a range of 1.77% since 1928.\n4 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017\nChart 7: A combination of upward trending global equity markets and\nvery low volatility have conspired to push trend following (CTA) equity\npositioning to near record levels. Consequently, the beta of CTA\nstrategies to global equities is also at extreme levels\nChart 8: Owing to low cross asset vol and strong diversification, the\nvolatility of risk-balanced multi-asset portfolios has fallen to historically\nlow levels. Consequently, leverage levels across multi-asset & other\nportfolios that target fixed vol have likely hit their caps\n1.00\n0.75\n0.50\n0.25\n0.00\n-0.25\n-0.50\n-0.75\n-1.00\nJan-15\nMar-15\nMay-15\nJul-15\nSep-15\nNov-15\nJan-16\nMar-16\nMay-16\nJul-16\nSep-16\nNov-16\nJan-17\nMar-17\nMSCI World (Ratio of trend strength to volatility) (LHS)\nBofAML Model CTA Global Equity Allocation (RHS)\nMay-17\n20\n15\n10\n5\n0\n-5\n-10\n-15\n-20\n24%\n20%\n16%\n12%\n8%\n4%\n0%\n1972\n1975\n1978\n1981\n1984\n1987\n1990\n1993\n1996\n1999\n2002\n2005\n2008\n2011\n2014\n2017\nModel Risk Parity Leverage (Vol Target: 10% & Max Leverage: 3x) (RHS)\nUnlevered BofAML Model Risk Parity Volatility (LHS)\n3.0x\n2.5x\n2.0x\n1.5x\n1.0x\n0.5x\n0.0x\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

For example, the SPX Sep 2475 put with a 2300 knock-out (continuous\nobservation) indicatively costs 70bps (spot ref 2451) and offers a 60% discount to the\nvanilla 2475/2300 put spread, which is itself historically cheap (Chart 12).\nIf SPX stays above the 2300 barrier at all points in time before expiry, the structure is\nequivalent to a 2475 put option. If the barrier is instead breached, the maximum loss\nwill be equal to the (low) upfront premium. The 2300 barrier is about 6% out-of-themoney,\nhence “allows” for the elusive 5% correction not seen since Brexit (on a closing\nbasis). However, investors can mitigate the risk of breaching the barrier by either\nmoving it farther down (e.g., a 2245 barrier would indicatively raise the cost from 0.7%\nto 1%), or by only observing it on a close-to-close basis (in turn sacrificing part of the\ndiscount).\n6.0%\n5.5%\n5.0%\n4.5%\n4.0%\n3.5%\nBacktest Actual\n3.0%\n'01 '02 '03 '04 '05 '06 '07 '08 '09 '10 '11 '12 '13 '14 '15 '16 '17\n2400\n2200\n2000\n1800\n1600\n1400\n1200\n1000\nFMS avg cash balance (%)\nS&P 500 (RHS)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Fund Manager Survey, Bloomberg.

After last week’s FOMC\nmeeting, the case for such a trade grows even stronger as the\nmarket thinks the Fed has become more hawkish, driving up\nreal rates and the USD. Amid this backdrop, one could see\noutperformance of Value names over Growth names, which tend\nto have higher amounts of offshore revenues that would come\nunder pressure by a stronger dollar.\nAdditionally, the trade remains attractive at current levels as\npricing has only been better 1% of the time in 5 years. Today,\n1.03 XLF calls could be bought for each QQQ call sold, whereas\nover the past 5 years, the average number of XLF calls that\ncould be purchased was only 0.80.\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research.

Nevertheless, implied vols across European indices remained\nmostly unchanged near 2 year lows.\n• European intra-sector correlation continues to decline while inter-sector\ncorrel has hit a floor: The average EU intra-sector 3m correlation is near a 10-\nyear low currently. In contrast, the average 3m inter-sector correlation reached a\n10-year low in Mar-17 driven by post US election reflation trades but is now\nrising off its lows likely driven by an unwind of reflation trades.\n• SX7E implied-realised correlation near 5-year highs: SX7E 6m implied\ncorrelation fell since Mar-17 but the implied-realised correlation spread remains\nin the 88 th 5-year percentile driven by even lower realised correlation.\n• ESTX50 3M put skew is near 5 year highs, in stark contrast to SXEP\n(European Oil & Gas equity) put skew which is close to 5 year lows.\n• The overall seasonality in ESTX50 realised volatility since 1987 has been one of\nrelatively lower vol during the summer months vs. autumn. In particular, May\nstands out as the lowest vol month across most 10 year horizons, and this\nalso appears to be the case so far this year.\nEU Intra-sector correl continues to decline while inter-sector correl is supported\nThe average European intra-sector 3m correlation is near a 10-year low, partly driven by\ndivergence within the personal & household goods, utilities, real-estate, autos and\ninsurance sectors (Chart 18 and Table 3). Interestingly, the average 3m inter-sector\ncorrelation reached a 10-year low on 14-Mar-17 (as the 8-Nov-16 US election led to the\noutperformance of sectors sensitive to inflation) but inter-sector correlation now seems\nsupported likely driven by the unwind of reflation trades (Chart 18).\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017 11\nChart 18: European intra-sector realised correlation is near a 10-year\nlow, which suggests that we are currently in a stock pickers\nenvironment\n100%\n80%\n60%\n40%\n20%\n0%\nJun-07\nFeb-08\nOct-08\nAverage SXXP 3m inter-sector correlation*\nAverage SXXP 3m intra-sector correlation**\n4th 10-yr\npercentile\nJun-09\nFeb-10\nOct-10\nJun-11\nFeb-12\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research. 3m correlations calculated using daily returns and\nassuming current weights.

Recently, BofAML analyst\nWinnie Wu turned very bearish on the sector as (1) leverage has rapidly increased—debt\nto GDP rose by 18% in 2016 and may go above 300% by 2019, (2) shadow banking has\nbecome too big, too complicated, and too levered to easily regulate—even at the\nhighest quality bank, China Merchants, off-balance sheet wealth management products\n(WMP) have grown to 40% the size of on-balance sheet assets from just 18% two years\nago, and (3) excessive home price inflation—low and middle-income households are late\nto the party and a correction in prices could have a systemic effect as property assets\nhave been used as collateral in WMPs.\nSPX: The Fed is now “collaring” the market\nSince the global financial crisis the Fed has been well known for providing a put option\nby its willingness to step in during periods of market stress. However, post the Fed\nmeeting last week, it appears the central bank has decided to cap its monetary support\nas some FOMC members seem worried that financial conditions are too loose.\nEffectively, the market is now “collared” (more so for the SPX compared to EM) as the\ndownside is protected by the Fed put (though with a lower strike price) while the upside\nis capped by log-jammed fiscal policy and positioning, where the risk of quant funds\nselling record equity positions meets cashed-up investors still accustomed to buyingthe-dip.\nThe depressed implied China vs. US risks should reverse\nWith the steep drop in global risk premium, the HSCEI-SPX 18-month variance swap\nspread has fallen back to the lower-end of its 5-year trading range. Since we believe the\nglobal synchronized monetary tightening will impact HSCEI volatility more than SPX\nvolatility, we recommend owning HSCEI-SPX 70/110% corridor variance at 5 vol points,\na 3 vol point discount to vanilla variance spreads. Investors will be exposed to the\nrealized vol spread between HSCEI and SPX as long as HSCEI stays within 70-110% of\nits initial level. Pricing of corridor variance is cheaper than vanilla variance as investors\ncan avoid paying for the rich HSCEI convexity below the 70% barrier. The trade has a\npositive carry and benefits during China risk-off events.\nNote that the potential HSCEI index enhancement will reduce the financial weightings in\nHSCEI from 70% to 50% and lower realized volatility by 1.8 vol points. However, the\nenhancement will be implemented in stages. It will probably start in Dec-17 at the\nearliest and will not be fully implemented by the end of 2018, in our view.\nIndicative pricing (As of 19-Jun-17)\nBuy HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 70/110% corridor variance swap: 5 vol points\n16 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017\nChart 24: The HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 (18-month) variance swap spread is\nback to the lower-end of its 5-year trading range\n20%\n18%\n16%\n14%\n12%\n10%\n8%\n6%\n4%\n2%\n0%\nJan-12\nMay-12\nSep-12\nJan-13\nMay-13\nSep-13\nJan-14\nMay-14\nSep-14\nJan-15\nMay-15\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research Data as of 2-Jan-12 to 16-Jun-17\n18-month constant maturity variance swap spread is used as a proxy of Dec18 variance swap spread\nSep-15\nJan-16\nMay-16\nDec18 HSCEI SPX Variance Spread\nSep-16\nJan-17\nMay-17\nChart 25: The long term HSCEI-SPX realized vol spread has been higher\nthan the current implied corridor variance spread (5%) 98% of the time\nsince 2007\n30%\n25%\n20%\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\nJul-07\nFeb-08\nSep-08\nApr-09\nNov-09\nJun-10\nJan-11\nAug-11\nMar-12\nOct-12\nMay-13\nDec-13\nJul-14\nFeb-15\nSep-15\nApr-16\nNov-16\nJun-17\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nHSCEI - SPX 18-month realized vol\nDec18 Variance Implied: 8%\nDec18 70/110% Corridor Variance Implied: 5%\nData as of 2-Jul-07 to 16-Jun-17\nChart 26: Historical payoff of buying HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 70/110%\ncorridor variance spread; higher payoffs during 2011-2012 and 2015\nsell-offs\n300,000\n250,000\n200,000\n150,000\n100,000\n50,000\n-\n-50,000\nJul-07\nJul-08\nJul-09\nJul-10\nJul-11\nJul-12\nJul-13\nJul-14\nJul-15\nJul-16\nTable 6: The HSCEI-SPX Dec-18 70/110% corridor variance trade\nhas a positive carry with realized vol across most tenors higher\nthan the current implied corridor variance swap spread\nHSCEI SPX Spread\n1M realized vol 12.1% 4.6% 7.5%\n3M realized vol 13.7% 6.8% 6.9%\n6M realized vol 14.0% 6.8% 7.2%\n12M realized vol 16.6% 9.7% 6.9%\n18M realized vol 20.8% 11.99% 8.8%\nHSCEI – SPX Dec18 70/110% corridor variance offer: 5.0%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nHSCEI-SPX Dec18 70/110% corridor historical payoff (10k\nvega)\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\nData as of 2-Jul-07 to 16-Jun-17\nGlobal Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017 17\nNotable trends and dislocations (Asia)\nMost regions in Asia reported modest declines last week, led by Hong Kong’s HSCEI,\nwhich lost 2.0% week-over-week. Much of the decline came on Thursday following the\nUS Fed’s decision to hike rates 25bps. Also in China, the People’s Bank of China (PBOC)\ninjected 410bn yuan (about $60bn) into the financial system via reverse-repos, the\nlargest cash boost since January. The central bank said the funds are meant to ease\nconcern amid a seasonal funding squeeze. The biggest contributors to the index’s loss\nwere financials names, including China Life Insurance (2628 HK), which fell 5.7%, Ping\nAn Insurance Group Co of China Ltd (2318 HK), which dropped 3.7%, Bank of China Ltd\n(3988 HK), which declined 1.8%, and China Merchants Bank Co Ltd (3968 HK), which fell\n5.7%. We saw a similar decline from Hong Kong’s HSI index, which lost 1.6% percent\nlast week.\nAfter the HSCEI and HSI, last week’s biggest losers were Korea’s KOSPI and India’s\nNIFTY, which each returned -0.8% week-over-week. In Japan, the Nikkei fell 0.3%. On\nFriday, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) left its monetary policy unchanged—it will continue to\ncontrol the yield curve via its negative benchmark rate and its asset purchasing program.\nThe final region to report a loss last week was Taiwan’s TWSE, which lost 0.4%.\nOn the other hand, the only region to see a gain last week was Australia, which saw its\nASX 200 benchmark increase 1.7% week-over-week. The biggest contributors to the\ngain were Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA AU), which gained 3.4%, Westpac\nBanking Corp (WBC AU), which increased 1.9%, and CSL Ltd (CSL AU), which added\n2.9%.\n10 day realized vol picked up in Asia last week, up 2.0 vol points to 9.6%\n• Asian 3m ATM volatility declined on average 0.1 vol point to 12.3% last week, while\n10 day realized vol increased on average 2.0 vol points to 9.6%. Notably, the HSI's\nrealized vol increased 5.4 vol points, the biggest increase in the region. On the\nother hand, the NKY was the only index to see a decline in 10 day realized vol—it\ndropped 4.3 vol points week-over-week to 7.2%.\n• On average, term structures among Asian indices steepened by 0.2 vol points to\n4.2% last week. The TWSE 12M-1M term structure steepened the most, increasing\n1.0 vol point to 2.9%. On the other hand, Hong Kong’s HSI saw the only flattening\nas its term structure flattened 0.1 vol point to 4.9%.\n• Asian 3M 90-110% skews widened 0.5 vol points on average to 3.8%. Taiwan’s\nTWSE widened the most, increasing 2.3 vol points to -0.2%.\nTable 7: Volatility measures of major Asian indices (data as of 16-Jun-17)\n3Mth ATM Implied Volatility 10D Realized Volatility 12Mth-1Mth ATM Vol Spread 3Mth 90-110 Skew Spread Equity Market\nWeekly 4Yr Weekly 4Yr Weekly 4Yr Weekly 4Yr Weekly\nCurrent change percentile Current change percentile Current change percentile Current change percentile return\nHSI 12.4% 0.2% 2.1% 10.2% 5.4% 20.6% 4.9% -0.1% 97.8% 3.3% 0.9% 41.4% -1.6%\nHSCEI 15.0% -0.4% 0.0% 10.7% 4.8% 7.8% 5.4% 0.2% 98.1% 1.4% 0.5% 36.5% -2.0%\nNKY 13.8% -0.2% 0.1% 7.2% -4.3% 1.8% 5.8% 0.5% 99.9% 5.8% 0.0% 73.9% -0.3%\nKOSPI 200 12.2% 0.2% 19.7% 11.1% 1.1% 53.1% 4.0% 0.2% 77.0% 3.8% 0.3% 43.7% -0.8%\nASX 200 11.8% -0.2% 17.7% 15.7% 5.1% 77.1% 2.7% 0.0% 59.5% 6.4% -0.1% 22.5% 1.7%\nNIFTY 10.7% 0.2% 2.2% 4.8% 1.0% 0.4% 4.0% 0.0% 76.1% 5.9% -0.1% 64.1% -0.8%\nTWSE 10.5% -0.6% 7.2% 7.8% 1.0% 20.3% 2.9% 1.0% 71.2% -0.2% 2.3% 3.9% -0.4%\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n18 Global Equity Volatility Insights | 20 June 2017\nChart 27: Both HSCEI and NKY term structures are near record steeps;\nwe favor calendar puts to hedge downside risks\n15%\n10%\n5%\n0%\n-5%\nJan-09\nJul-09\nJan-10\nJul-10\nJan-11\nJul-11\nJan-12\nJul-12\nNKY 3M-12M ATM Vol\nJan-13\nJul-13\nJan-14\nJul-14\nJan-15\nJul-15\nJan-16\nJul-16\nHSCEI 3M-12M ATM Vol\nJan-17\nCalendar puts are attractively priced given the steep term\nstructure\nWith the continuous low realized volatility environment, both\nNKY and HSCEI 3-month minus 12-month term structures\nsteepened to -3.7 vol points, which are near multi-year lows.\nAs our strategists think the Fed now appears concerned about\nsurging asset prices, investors should consider downside\nhedges.
