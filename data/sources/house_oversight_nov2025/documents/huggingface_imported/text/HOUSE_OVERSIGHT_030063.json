  "text": "That’s heresy enough for Wiesenfeld. This time, however, the counter-\nwave was powerful. J Street, an organization not around in 2003 that\nsupports Israel but opposes the settlements, issued a statement calling\nCUNY’s action “unacceptable.” Former mayor Ed Koch, of\nimpeccable pro-Israel credentials, weighed in. Within days CUNY\nreversed itself and approved Kushner’s degree.\n\nNow Wiesenfeld is under pressure to resign. He should: No\nuniversity is well served by a trustee who values taboo over debate\nand doubts an entire people’s humanity.\n\nKushner told me he believes “there is a very significant change\nunderway.” Americans are realizing there is “a terrible need for a\ndose of debate” on Israel and that “silent acquiescence” to those\n“whose politics are based substantially on fantasy and theological\nwishes” is dangerous.\n\nCriticism of Israel is not betrayal of Israel. The Kushner affair, like\nthe Judt affair before it, is important in that Israel’s political compass\nis guided to some degree by its sense of the American mood. That\nmood, beginning in the White House, is of growing impatience.\nBenjamin Netanyahu, the Israeli prime minister, will address\nCongress this month. He has responded to tumultuous events in the\nMiddle East with vapid tactical sound bites. The speech to Congress\nis his chance to lay out a strategy for two states. I doubt he’ll ever\nlocate his inner statesman — in which case the world’s irritation and\nfutile Palestinian unilateralism will harden.\n\nYitzhak Rabin did not stand on the White House lawn with Yasser\nArafat for a photo-op. The Israeli warrior understood the necessity of\na two-state peace. To get there at last, “It’s essential that we become\nmore sophisticated and braver in what we’re willing to say and\nthink,” Kushner said.\n\nAmen to that — and Tony Judt, great man, requiescat in pace.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030063",
