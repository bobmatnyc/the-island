What they do rely on is the assumption that, in the\nintelligence in question, the different components of memory are significantly but not wholly\ndistinct. That is, there are significant “family resemblances” between the memories of a single\ntype, yet there are also thoroughgoing connections between memories of different types.\n\nThe cognitive synergy principle, if correct, applies to any AI system demonstrating intelli-\ngence in the context of embodied, social communication. However, one may also take the theory\nas an explicit guide for constructing AGI systems; and of course, the bulk of this book describes\none AGI architecture, CogPrime, designed in such a way.\n\nIt is possible to cast these notions in mathematical form, and we make some efforts in this\ndirection in Appendix ??, using the languages of category theory and information geometry.\nHowever, this formalization has not yet led to any rigorous proof of the generality of cognitive\nsynergy nor any other exciting theorems; with luck this will come as the mathematics is further\ndeveloped. In this chapter the presentation is kept on the heuristic level, which is all that is\ncritically needed for motivating the CogPrime design.\n\n8.2 Cognitive Synergy\n\nThe essential idea of cognitive synergy, in the context of multi-cmemory systems, may be ex-\npressed in terms of the following points:\n\n1. Intelligence, relative to a certain set of environments, may be understood as the capability\nto achieve complex goals in these environments.\n\n2. With respect to certain classes of goals and environments (see Chapter 9 for a hypothe-\nsis in this regard), an intelligent system requires a “multi-memory” architecture, meaning\nthe possession of a number of specialized yet interconnected knowledge types, including:\ndeclarative, procedural, attentional, sensory, episodic and intentional (goal-related). These\nknowledge types may be viewed as different sorts of patterns that a system recognizes in\nitself and its environment. Knowledge of these various different types must be interlinked,\nand in some cases may represent differing views of the same content (see Figure ?7)\n\n3. Such a system must possess knowledge creation (i.e. pattern recognition / formation) mech-\nanisms corresponding to each of these memory types. These mechanisms are also called\n“cognitive processes.”\n\n4, Each of these cognitive processes, to be effective, must have the capability to recognize when\nit lacks the information to perform effectively on its own; and in this case, to dynamically\nand interactively draw information from knowledge creation mechanisms dealing with other\ntypes of knowledge\n\n5. This cross-mechanism interaction must have the result of enabling the knowledge creation\nmechanisms to perform much more effectively in combination than they would if operated\nnon-interactively. This is “cognitive synergy.”\n\nWhile these points are implicit in the theory of mind given in [GoeN6al], they are not articulated\nin this specific form there.\n\nInteractions as mentioned in Points 4 and 5 in the above list are the real conceptual meat\nof the cognitive synergy idea. One way to express the key idea here is that most AI algorithms\nsuffer from combinatorial explosions: the number of possible elements to be combined in a\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013060",
