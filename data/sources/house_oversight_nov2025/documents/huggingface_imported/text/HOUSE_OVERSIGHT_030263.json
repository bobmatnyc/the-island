  "text": "Office and staff would survive the Special Counsel's ouster and their\nwork preserved. And that actions taken by the Grand Jury would remain\nin effect.\n\nThis, however, would probably not be true if the Attorney General\nrefused the next Special Counsel's budget request—due on July 1. That\nwould shut down the whole operation—the Special Counsel staff and\ngrand juries. There might, however, according to research the team has\nprepared, be enough time between the order and the shuttering for the\nSpecial Counsel to share the grand jury evidence with other federal\nprosecutors, who might act on their own authority to pursue the\nPresident.\n\nThe President's constitutional pardon powers appear to be some\nof the most troubling and threatening issues for the Special Counsel. The\nCounsel's office believes the President will use his pardon power as an\ninstrument to undermine the investigation.\n\nAccording to present and former White House advisors, the\nPresident's recent spate of pardons are in part his way of taunting the\nSpecial Counsel. The White House, according to these sources, is aware\nthat the Special Counsel has concluded the President's pardon power is\nnear absolute: the President can certainly pardon himself, and others\ninvolved in the investigation.\n\nEarly in June, the Special Counsel, believing that a pardon for\nMichael Flynn was imminent, rushed to build a case that might form an\nexception to the President's pardon authority. The argument, perhaps a\nslim-thread one, tries to undermine what both the White House and\nmany outside legal authorities, and much of the Special Counsel's own\nresearch, believes to be one of the few unchallengeable powers granted\nthe President. In effect, the Special Counsel continues the theme of it’s\ncase: there is a level of obstruction of justice that all reasonable men\nmight know when they see it. If you pardon someone to get yourself off\nthe hook, that’s a \"corrupt\" action. The constitution is not a statute that\nyou might violate, but a larger covenant which you might offend (or,\nequally, that might protect you). Since the President is in charge of\nupholding the constitution and much of the constitution is about\npreventing corrupt acts or abuses of power, the pardon, in the case of\nMichael Flynn, is, the Mueller team is set to argue, unconstitutional.\nWhat's more, since there is an impeachment process in place—or there\nare impeachment resolutions before congress—and impeachment is the\nprovince of Congress, a pardon of a potential witness in this\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030263",
