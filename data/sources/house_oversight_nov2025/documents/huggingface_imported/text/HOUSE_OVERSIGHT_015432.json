  "text": "study to determine the feasibility of constructing a scientific/military base.\n\n“| was one of the lucky thirteen,” George remembers. “In fact, you\ndon’ t have to be a rocket scientist to be a rocket scientist. Von Braun told\nme that many of his ideas came from science-fiction magazines.\n\n“The project was so secret that the thirteen of us could not even\ntell our bosses--they didn’ t have what was called ‘need to know.’ |\nwould tell [my wife] Judith that | was going to Washington, D.C., and then |\nwould change planes to go to Huntsville, Alabama, where much of the\nwork was done. | made up stories about Washington for her, while | really\nwas in Huntsville, which also was the watercress capital of the world. I’ d\nmake up a story about the cherry blossoms, or seeing a senator in the\nstreet.\n\n“Unfortunately, when | left the government after nine years (two in\nthe army), | lost my own security rating and need-to-know, so | had no\nidea if the station was ever built on the moon, and | no longer got cheap\nwatercress.” According to Wikipedia, “The permanent outpost was\npredicted to cost $6 billion and become operational in December 1966. A\nlunar landing-and-return vehicle would have shuttled up to 16 astronauts\nat a time to the base and back. Horizon never progressed past the\n\nfeasibility stage in an official capacity.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015432",
