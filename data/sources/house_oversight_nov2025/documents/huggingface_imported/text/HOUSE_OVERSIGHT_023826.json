  "text": "80 Teaching Minds\n\nwithin a real and meaningful context works a whole lot better than\nshoving it down their throats and following that with a multiple\nchoice test. But for the vast majority of citizens, Algebra II is never\nused.\n\nThere is no evidence whatsoever that says that a nation that is\ntrailing in math test scores will somehow trail in GDP or whatever it\nis we really care about. This is just plain silly, but we keep repeating\nthe mantra that we are behind Korea in math as if it has been proven\nthat this matters in some way. Nothing of the sort has been proven.\nWhat is true is that there are a great many vested interests that need\nto keep teaching math: tutoring companies, testing companies, math\nteachers, book publishers, and many others who make lots of money\nwhen people are scared into thinking that their kid won’t get into col-\nlege because he or she is bad at Algebra II. Nearly every grownup has\nforgotten whatever algebra he or she ever learned to pass those silly\ntests, so it is clear that algebra is meaningless for adult life. Any college\nprofessor who is honest will tell you that algebra almost never comes\nup in any college course, and when it does come up it usually needn’t\nbe there in the first place.\n\nSo, math isn’t important and history isn’t important. What is\nimportant?\n\nTests. Tests are very important. Not to me, of course, but my vote\nisn’t being counted.\n\nThe past two presidents have been obsessed with raising test scores.\nI am assuming this is true because some political analysts somewhere\nhave determined that the general public believes in the significance of\nraising tests scores and will vote for politicians who are able to show\nthat they have done it. There can’t be any other reason. Try taking\nthose tests. Most of them are available online. See how well you can\ndo at them.\n\nBut what could really be wrong with testing and emphasizing test\nscores?\n\nTESTING TEACHES THAT THERE ARE RIGHT ANSWERS\nThe problem is that in real life, the important questions don’t have an-\n\nswers that are clearly right or wrong. “Knowing the answer” has made\nschool into Jeopardy. It is nice to win a game show, but important\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023826",
