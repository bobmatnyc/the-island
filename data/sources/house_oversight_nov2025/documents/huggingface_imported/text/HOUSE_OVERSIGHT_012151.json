  "text": "KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n\nsexual organ of another; anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object; or the\nhandling or fondling of the sexual organ of another for the purpose of masturbation.” Fla. Stat. §\n796.01(1)(d). Also, the Florida Supreme Court jury instructions define prostitution as involving\n\n“sexual intercourse.” As a result, topless massages—even ones for hire that include self-\nmasturbation—fall outside the ambit of the state-law definition of prostitution. Absent proof\nbeyond a reasonable doubt that, at the critical time of the communication, Mr. Epstein had a\nspecific intent to persuade another to engage in prostitution or “sexual activity,” as defined by\nFlorida law, he cannot be guilty of an offense under § 2422(b).\n\nAs important, the plain language of the phrase “for which any person can be charged”\nnecessarily excludes acts as to which the state’s statute of limitations has run. Under Florida\nlaw, prostitution and prostitution-related offenses are misdemeanors in the second degree for a\nfirst violation.” See Fla. Stat.. § 796. 07(4)(a). The limitations period for a misdemeanor in the\nsecond degree is one year, and there is no tolling provision based upon the victim’s age. See Fla.\nStat. § 775.15(b). Even as to allegations of third degree felonies, the statute of limitations is\nthree years. Thus, any conduct alleged to have occurred before mid-June 2005 cannot be\ncharged as a matter of state law and thus cannot be a predicate for a § 2422(b) offense—even if\nthe federal statute of limitations has not run on any given § 2422(b) offense because of the\nlengthier statute codified in 18 U.S.C. § 3282. Thus, no prosecution under § 2422(b) can be\nbrought based upon inducement of prostitution or sexual activity for which Florida’s statute of\nlimitation has run. Furthermore, in Florida, the statute of limitations does not simply give rise to\nan affirmative defense. On the contrary, statute of limitations “creates a substantive right which\nprevents prosecution and conviction of an individual after the statute has run.” See State v. King,\n282 So. 2d 162 (Fla. 1973); Tucker v. State, 417 So. 2d 1006 (Fla. 3d D.C.A. 1982) (citing\ncases).\n\nGiven the one-year statute of limitations, any conduct that might amount to prostitution\nor other chargeable sexual activity that occurred before one year from today is not conduct for\nwhich any person can be charged with a criminal offense. Also, given the three year statute of\nlimitations for third degree felonies, any allegations of illegal state criminal conduct that is\nclassified as a third degree felony cannot be charged in the state and, concomitantly, cannot be\nthe basis for a federal charge under § 2422(b), to the extent that it occurred—as did almost all of\nthe pivotal allegations (e.g., the [MM allegation which was made in March of 2005)\nprior to mid-June of 2005.\n\nZe 18 U.S.C. § 1591\n\n2 The offense is a felony of the third degree only for a third or subsequent violation. Fla. Stat. § 796.07(4)( c).\n\n10\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012151",
