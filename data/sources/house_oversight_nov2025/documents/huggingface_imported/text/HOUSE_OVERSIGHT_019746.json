Trust me, I’ve been there.\n\n—EDWARD SNOWDEN, Moscow, 2014\n\nWa WAITING to hear back from Kucherena’s office, I\narranged to meet with Victor Cherkashin, who had been one\nof the most successful KGB spy handlers in the Cold War. Cher-\nkashin, born in 1932, had served in the KGB’s espionage branch\nfrom 1952 until 1991 and now operated a private security firm in\nMoscow. I was particularly interested in his recruitment of three\ntop American intelligence officers: Aldrich Ames of the CIA, Robert\nHanssen of the FBI, and Ronald Pelton of the NSA. I hoped that see-\ning these intelligence coups through the eyes, and mind-set, of their\nKGB handler might provide some historical context for the Snowden\ndefection. So I invited Cherkashin to lunch at Gusto, a quiet Italian\nrestaurant, located near the Chekhov Theater in Moscow.\n\nCherkashin, a tall thin man with silver hair, showed up promptly\nat 1:00 p.m., wearing an elegant gray suit and dark tie.
