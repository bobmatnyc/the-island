  "text": "organic and fair-trade as I could be, mostly because of expense, but I try to do it when I\ncan.\n\nKickass Vegan Chocolate Chip Cookies\n\nThis is a modified version of a recipe that I originally found here, and some of the text\ncomes from that recipe.\n\n+ 1 and 1/2 cups of FLOUR\n\n+ | teaspoon BAKING SODA\n\n+ 1 teaspoon SALT\n\n+ 3/4 cup of OIL\n\n+ 2 tablespoons COCONUT MILK (or ALMOND MILK or SOY MILK)\n+ 1 & 1/3 cups of UNREFINED SUGAR\n\n+ HALF A BANANA\n\n+ 1 1/2 tablespoons VANILLA EXTRACT (I've occasionally used RUM as a\nreplacement; when I do that, I like to add some CINNAMON)\n\n+ 2 1/2 cups OATMEAL\n+ 12 oz. of DARK CHOCOLATE CHIPS\n\nHeat your oven to 350 degrees.\nMix FLOUR, BAKING SODA and SALT together. Set aside.\n\nMix together the OIL and SUGAR. Mix until creamy. Thoroughly mash the BANANA\ninto the mixture.\n\nAdd the COCONUT MILK.\n\nAdd the VANILLA.\n\nStir this mixture until it is a uniform color (this will not take long).\nSlowly stir in the FLOUR mixture. Mix this well.\n\nStir in OATMEAL and CHOCOLATE-CHIPS.\n\nPreheat oven to baking temperature (usually 350 F).\n\nPlace large tablespoons full of the batter onto an ungreased cookie sheet (an air filled\ncookie sheet works best, as the air between the two layers of the sheet keeps the bottom\nof baked items from burning).\n\nBake the cookies for about 9 to 13 minutes (ovens vary in temperature). Check them by\ngently pressing on the top of one of the cookies. If the inside looks moist, but not too wet,\nthey are probably done. It might take you a couple of tries to get the time down, so bake\nonly a few at a time when starting out. Do not, I repeat, do not expect to see them turn\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018599",
