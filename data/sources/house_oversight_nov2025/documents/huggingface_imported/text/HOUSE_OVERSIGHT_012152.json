  "text": "KIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\n\n18 U.S.C. § 1591, a sex trafficking statute, provides up to 40 years’ imprisonment for\nanyone (1) who recruits or obtains by any means a person in interstate commerce (ii) knowing\nthat the person is under 18 and (iii) knowing that the person will be caused to engage in a\ncommercial sex: act. The most heinous of crimes, described on the CEOS website, fall within\nthis statute and include the buying and selling of children and the forced servitude of third-world\nimmigrants brought to this country to be enslaved. Mr. Epstein’s behavior is nowhere near the\nheartland of this statute. This statute has also been previously reserved for prostitution rings\ninvolving violence, drugs and force. In stark contrast, there is no jurisdictional hook that brings\nMr. Epstein’s conduct within the ambit of the statute, and securing a prosecution on these facts\nwould require a court to set aside both reason and precedent to convict a local ‘John’ with a sex-\nslavery crime. It can not be said that Mr. Epstein engaged in trafficking and slavery nor did he\nknowingly recruit or obtain underage women with knowledge that they would be caused to\nengage in a commercial sex act. Thus, prosecuting him under this statute would expand the law\nfar beyond its scope.\n\nTo the extent there are cases where prosecutors think that Mr. Epstein should have known\nthat certain women were underage, there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein “caused [them] to\nengage in a commercial sex act.” The term “cause” naturally implies the application of some\nsort of force, coercion, or undue pressure, but there is no evidence that Mr. Epstein’s interactions\nwith the women were anything but consensual. Again, many of the women phoned Mr.\nEpstein’s assistant themselves in order to determine whether he wanted a massage. Nor can the\ncause requirement be proved simply by the fact that Mr. Epstein compensated the women. After\nall, the statute elsewhere requires that the women “engage in a commercial sex act,” which by\ndefinition means that they would have received something of value in exchange for sexual\nservices. Interpreting the statute to authorize prosecution whenever a commercial sex act results\nfrom solicitation thus would render the term “caused” superfluous, and would make every ‘John’\nwho interacts with an underage prostitute guilty of a federal crime—even where the transaction\nis entirely local. Read in context, then, there is no doubt that the statute targets pimps and sex-\ntraffickers who knowingly obtain underage girls and direct them to engage in prostitution. There\nis not a shred of evidence that Mr. Epstein (or his assistants) did any such thing, and he cannot be\nprosecuted under this statute.\n\nThe Cuellar and Santos decisions also foreclose a prosecution under § 1591. Just as the\nfederal money laundering statute did not come down to a proscription against transportation of\ncriminal proceeds that are hidden, the sex trafficking of children statute cannot be boiled down\n\nand expanded to a federal proscription of commercial sexual activity with persons who turn out\nto be below the age of 18.\n\n3. 18 U.S.C. § 2423\n\n1]\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012152",
