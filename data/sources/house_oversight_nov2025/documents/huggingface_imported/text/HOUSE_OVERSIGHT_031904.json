And looking at that in the long-\nrun, I would still bet on the West, with its rule of law and systems of\nchecks and balances on authority.\n\nSHAFFER: You’ve probably heard a lot of phony rebuttals based on\nmisreading of The End of History. So, | won’t attempt one — but\nyou’ve made oblique references to your own revisions and criticisms.\nHow does the rise of China and the current Arab unrest, for example,\nfit into the end of history?\n\nFUKUYAMA: If you understand the original thesis correctly, what I\nwas saying is that there was a theory of history among progressive\nintellectuals for most of the 20th century. That theory of history was\nMarxism. And according to the Marxists, the end of history was a\ncommunist utopia. My observation in the late 1980s is that we\nweren't going to get there. Liberal democracies seemed to be the\nhighest stage of political development, and I didn’t see any real\nalternatives.
