It matters a great deal and\nthe better you are at it, the easier your life will go. The same is true of\nthe third mental process: analysis of causation. Knowing why some-\nthing happened allows us to not do it again—if we didn’t like the end\nresult—or to try to do it again, if we did, and everything in between.\nDetermining causation is a mental process that is very similar to diag-\nnosis, of course.\n\nSo these three are all cognitive processes and they require constant\npractice. Getting better at them throughout one’s life is very impor-\ntant. I define learning as improvement in one’s cognitive processes.\nLifetime learning does not mean the continual acquisition of knowl-\nedge so much as it means the improvement in one’s ability to do these\nprocesses by means of the acquisition and analysis of experiences to\ndraw on.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023802",
