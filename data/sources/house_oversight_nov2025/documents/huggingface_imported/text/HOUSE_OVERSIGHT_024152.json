  "text": "Swiss equities\n\nSMI (27 June): 5,997 (last month: 5,818)\nUBS View SMI (6-month target): 6,200\n¢ Swiss listed companies generate a high share of profits in economies outside Switzerland. Consequently,\nthe Swiss equity market is affected by the recent weakening in global growth.\n¢ Swiss companies try to mitigate concerns on the global economic prospects by maintaining tight cost\ncontrols. This should allow to maintain relatively robust operating margins in 2012.\ne While the Swiss franc remains overvalued, we expect the currency impact to gradually become less of a\ndrag. In fact, at current exchange rates, Swiss companies' earnings would show some positive currency\ntranslation effects by end 2012, compared to the previous year.\ne Still, the PE-ratio of the market is relatively high compared to the global average, indicating less\nattractive value. The SMI is trading at about 12.8x realized earnings. We are thus more cautious on the\nability of the market to deliver further multiple expansion in a challenging market environment. As a\nresult, we maintain a small underweight stance on Swiss equities.\n\nA Positive scenario SMI (6-month target): 6,900\ne Eurozone economic growth reaccelerates meaningfully, providing relief to Swiss financials as well as\nSwiss exporters. Defensive sectors would likely be left behind in a relief rally. In this scenario, we would\nexpect the equity market P/E to re-rate to 14x and earnings to grow by 5% over the next six months.\n\n& Negative scenario SMI (6-month target): 5,075\n¢ The sovereign debt crisis re-escalates, leading to further downside for Swiss financials and the export-\nfocused Industrials and Materials sectors. In this scenario, corporate earnings could drop by 5-10% over\nthe next six months and we would expect the P/E to contract significantly, toward 11.5x.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nEconomic indicators Key announcement dates of domestic economic indicators: 2 July, PMI\nmanufacturing; 27 July, KOF Swiss leading indicator\n\nMonetary and economic\npolicy\n\nCorporate results\n\nKey Swiss/European monetary policy dates that can impact Swiss equities: 2 July,\nSNB meeting; 5 July, ECB Governing Council meeting\n\nKey corporate announcement dates that could move the market: 5 July, Barry\nCallebaut; 12 July, Partners Group; 16 July, Kuhne+Nagel; 17 July, Georg\nFischer & SGS; 19 July, Actelion; 20 July, Sulzer; 25 July, Rieter & Lonza; 26\nJuly, ABB, CS Group, Logitech & Sika\n\n36 UBS\n\nFor further information please contact CIO's asset class specialist Stefan Meyer, stefan-r.meyer@ubs.com\n\nPreference: underweight\n\nRecommendations\n\nTactical (6 months)\n\ne We favor companies with a strong and\nbroad foothold in emerging markets, as\nwell as innovative companies able to\nmarket their products and services\nefficiently and globally.\n\ne We continue to favor large caps.\n\nStrategic (1 to 2 years)\n\ne We like stocks paying high and\nsustainable dividends.\n\ne¢ Moreover, we favor leaders in regards\nto the two key Swiss success factors:\ninnovation and globalization.\n\nSwiss market trades at a P/E-premium\n(based on realized earnings)\n\n42\n\n—_\n\n2003 2005 2007 2009 2011\n\n—— MSCI Switzerland: realized P/E MSCI World: realized P/E\n\nSource: Thomsen Reuters, UBS CIO, as of 25 June 2012\n\nNote: Past performance is not an indication of future returns.\n\n17\n\nPlease see important disclaimer and disclosures at the end of the document.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024152",
