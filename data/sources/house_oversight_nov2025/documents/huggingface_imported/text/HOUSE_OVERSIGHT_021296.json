Berntson, Ph.D., a\nProfessor of Psychology, Psychiatry and\nPediatrics and a member of the Neurosciences\nGraduate Faculty at the Ohio State University.\nHe is a co-founder (with John Cacioppo) of the\nfield of social neuroscience, is a co-editor of the\nHandbook of Psychophysiology and the\nHandbook of Neuroscience for the Behavioral\nSciences, and 1s the President of the Society for\nPsychophysiological Research. Berntson’s\nresearch focuses on the evolutionary\ndevelopment of the neuraxis, with special regard\nto levels of organization in neurobehavioral\nsystems, affective processes and autonomic\nregulation. He has published over 200 articles in\nscientific outlets and six books.\n\nBerntson begins with the fact that\nknowledge, thoughts and beliefs can influence\nour behaviors. Behaviors, of course, are\nphysiological processes entailing neural\noperations and muscular actions. Here we see a\nclear intersection between the psychological\ndomain on the one hand (knowledge, thoughts\nand beliefs) and the physical domain\n(neuromuscular effector systems) on the other.\nBut mind-body relations extend beyond the\nobservable actions or skeletal muscles. The mind\nand its organ, the brain, also impact powerfully\non internal bodily functions associated with the\nautonomic nervous system, the endocrine\nsystem, and the immune system, to name just a\nfew. Through these interactions, psychological\nprocesses can be translated in outcomes that have\npowerful significance for adaptation and health.\nBerntson explores the processes by which\nthoughts can manifest in fundamental changes in\ninternal physiology and health.\n\nPage |50\n\nunderstanding. We consider the most\ncommon of these to be empirically\nacquired, learned facts, relations,\nassociations, and perceptual and motor\nskills. Such learned associations serve as\npowerful determinants of thought and\nbehavior. But other sources of\ninformation and knowledge also affect\nour interaction with the environment,\nincluding reflex-like (constitutionally\nendowed) circuits that are independent\nof explicit learning. Examples include\ncentral networks for pain withdrawal,\nhunger circuits for the ingestion of\nessential nutrients, social affiliation\nnetworks, and neural systems that\npromote maternal bonding. Each of\nthese sources of information or\nknowledge can impact thoughts and\nbeliefs, and thoughts and beliefs can\nimpact behaviors and other bodily\nfunctions.\n\n“_.a Maori woman who,\n\nhaving eaten some fruit, was told that it\nhad been taken\n\nfrom a tabooed place; she\nexclaimed that the sanctity of the chief\nhad been profaned\n\nand that his spirit would kill\nher ... the next day ... she was\ndead.”(1)\n\n“T have seen a strong young\nman die .... the same day he was tapued\n\n(tabooed); the victims die\nunder it as though their strength ran out\nas water. . .”(1)\n\nA superstition is a belief, based\nnot on reason or knowledge, but on\nlegend, magical thinking, or other non-\nrational basis. Beliefs color the way we\nperceive the world, they direct and shape\nour actions, and define our personalities.\nBeliefs are powerful determinants of\naction. A useful illustration of the power\nof beliefs comes from the parable of the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021296",
