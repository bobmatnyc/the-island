  "text": "in front of him, the first thing Johnson would do now is kill him.” She\nsmiled sardonically, adding, “Unless Bobby beat him to it.”\nPostscript:\n\nThe most significant thing about “The Parts Left Out of the\nKennedy Book” was its widespread acceptance--if only for a moment--by\nintelligent, literate people, from an ACLU official to a Peabody Award-\nwinning journalist to members of the intelligence community who knew\nthat sort of thing actually does go on. Daniel Ellsberg said, “Maybe it was\njust because | wanted to believe it so badly.”\n\nOne caller claimed that he could determine, by feeding the article\ninto a computer, whether Manchester had written the portions | published.\nSeveral individuals queried that final arbiter of truth, the Playboy Adviser.\nOne reader “went out and bought the original Death of a President just\nto see if your parts would fit into the book--they did. Amazing!”\n\n| also received a call from Ray Marcus, a critic of the Warren\nCommission Report, who had discovered a chronological flaw in my article.\nHow could William Manchester leave something out of his book that was\nitself a report of something that he’ d left out of his book?
