It was also the “classic\nattitude” that the CIA sought to exploit in its adversaries, accord-\ning to a former deputy director. “ You find someone working for the\nother side and tell him that he is not receiving the proper recogni-\ntion, pay, and honors due him,” Morell said, pointing out that the\nsame “psychological dynamic” could be used to motivate someone\nto “act alone” in gathering espionage material.\n\nI next turned to an even more important KGB coup with Cher-\nkashin: the Robert Hanssen case. From the KGB’s perspective, Hans-\nsen was an extraordinary espionage source. He was a walk-in who\n\n© never entered the Soviet embassy or met with KGB case officers, but ©\nin working as a KGB mole between 1979 and 2001, he had deliv-\nered even more documents to the Russian intelligence services than\nAmes. Cherkashin learned of this potential spy when he received an\nanonymous letter from him identifying an FBI source in the Soviet\nembassy. When that tip proved to be accurate, Cherkashin got the\nresources he needed from the KGB to develop this source. From the\nstart of his work for the KGB, Hanssen laid down his own rules.\nThe KGB would deliver cash from which all the fingerprints were\nremoved to locations, or “dead drops,” he specified. He would deliver\ndocuments exposing FBI, CIA, and NSA sources and methods in\nanother dead drop. The KGB would precisely follow his instructions.\n\nCherkashin told me that Hanssen’s “astounding self-recruitment”\nwas executed in such a way that the KGB never actually controlled\nhim. “He was our most important mole and we didn’t ever know his\nidentity, where he worked, or how he had access to FBI, CIA, and\nNSA files.” Even so, the KGB (and later the SVR) paid him $600,000\nin cash. In return, the anonymous spy delivered twenty-seven com-\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.indd 260 ® 9/30/16 8:13AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019748",
