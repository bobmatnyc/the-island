  "text": "Biggest 1Q issues/risks:\n¢ Commentary on US customer trends, particularly repeat rates and unit economics\n(customer acquisition costs).\n\n« AOV trends given street concerns that some customer metrics are benefitting from\npurchase of lower value items.\n\n¢ Progress with International investments, especially early results from ad spending in\nUK, Canada, and Germany.\n\n1Q data points indicate mixed traffic trends\n\nUS data indicates that Wayfair PC minutes growth increased 17% y/y in 1Q through\nFebruary vs. 14% y/y growth in 4Q’16. Wayfair mobile minutes have decreased 24% y/y\nthrough February in 1Q vs. up 3% y/y in 4Q’16. US PC user growth decreased 16% y/y in\n1Q through February, vs. 4Q at -25% y/y. Wayfair mobile user growth increased 2% y/y\nin 1Q through February vs. 16% y/y in 4Q.\n\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Expect revenue and EPS upside vs. the Street\n\nFor 1Q, we expect revenue/EBITDA of $944mn/($22mn) vs. the Street at\n$933mn/($32mn). Total revenue guidance of $905-930mn implies 2-year stacked\ngrowth of 97-101% vs. 121% in 2016, which seems conservative. We expect the\ncompany’s revenue to come in above the high end of the sales outlook as Direct\nRevenue sales were up 30% quarter to date (through nearly 2 months of 1Q’17). Our\n1Q revenue growth forecast is based on 48% y/y customer growth (up 9% q/q) and 42%\norder growth (down 10% q/q}. Wayfair expects EBITDA margin of (3.5%)-(3.8%)} due to a\nlower opex absorption in the quarter on seasonally lower sales. The company continues\nto expect little to no ad spend leverage given increase International ad spend.\n\nTable 28: Wayfair Estimate Summary\n\n1Q17 2017 2017 2018 2019\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $944 $980 $4,169 $5,019 $5,872\nGrowth Y/Y% 26% 25% 23% 20% 17%\nStreet $933 $987 $4,237 $5,258 $6,585\nBofAML vs. Street Above Below Below Below Below\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. -$22 -$19 -$48 $10 $64\nStreet -$32 -$20 -$59 $23 $134\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Below Below\nEPS\nBofAML est.

We continue to focus on EV/Sales given\nWayfair’s lack of profitability due to US fulfilment investment and Intl. expansion. Our\n0.7x target multiple is a discount to Wayfair’s eCommerce comp group at 1.3x and at a\nmodest discount to a retail peer comp group at 0.8x. We think the multiple is\nappropriate given strong revenue growth vs. peers, balanced by lower profitability.\n\n42 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 Bankof America <2\nMerrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014928",
