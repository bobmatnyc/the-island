  "text": "were underage; prostitution charges in Florida (as in\nmost places) have no age limits and the Palm Beach\ngrand jury proposed solely a solicitation charge. But\nEpstein’s flamboyance and his friendship with Clinton\ninvited the scrutiny of the Bush FBI, and ultimately\nEpstein and his legal team decided to go for a plea deal.\nThe result was a baroque set of agreements with both\nthe Feds and Palm Beach county, which mandated jail\ntime (Epstein was sentenced to 18 months, of which he\nserved 13—nearly all Florida prisoners serve only 70%\nof their officially sentenced time) and sex offender\nstatus. The deal also provided for an unusual, if not\nunprecedented, arrangement by which he agreed to pay\nthe legal fees for 40 girls specified by the FBI in civil\nsuits against him and not to oppose their claims,\nresulting in an overall settlement costs that may be as\nhigh as $20 million. (A bit more baroqueness: one of the\nlawyers representing some of the plaintiffs, Scott\nRothstein, would also go to jail for recruiting investors\nto pay for these suits on the fraudulent basis that\nsettlements had already been reached and that many of\nthe listed women had agreed to take reduced immediate\ncash payments. )\n\nIt is in part this impossible-to-explain weird-justice\noutcome that has made some people think Epstein was\ncovering for someone, or something, else—perhaps his\nmost high-profile friend?\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022920",
