  "text": "16 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nof these skills were lost in the Dark Ages but, once the Renaissance was\nunderway in the 16\" and 17\" centuries, complex mechanical clocks were\ndevised that were capable of predicting the motions of the planets to a\nhigh degree of precision. Mechanical, hand-cranked calculators appeared\nin the mid-18\" century, and in 1886 Charles Babbage conceived the\nfirst programmable computing machine, The Analytical Engine. It was\ndesigned to read programs from cards, and used cogs and wheels to\nperform the calculations. His first machine - The Difference Engine —\nwas designed to help the Admiralty calculate tide tables, but Babbage\nrealized he could generalize it to compute almost any function. He ran\nout of money to complete any of his machines, but in the 20th century a\ndedicated band of enthusiasts built a working model of Difference Engine\nNo.2. One copy sits in the London Science Museum and another in the\nComputer History Museum in California. These difference machines are\nnot Turing complete and his Analytical Engine has never been built.\n\n19\" Century Calculators\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015706",
