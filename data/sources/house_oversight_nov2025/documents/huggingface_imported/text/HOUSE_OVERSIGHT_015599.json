The Defendant is abusing the subpoena power in an effort to\nintimidate, harass and cause undue burden to a non-party. Indeed, Defendant - just days ago -\npublicly admitted that his goal of deposing Jane Doe No. 3 has nothing to do with this Florida\nDefamation Action; rather, he is trying to find a way to send this victim of sexual trafficking to\n\n“Jail.” “She was hiding in Colorado...but we found her and she will have to be deposed. The end\n\n* For the limited purpose of the Motion to Quash or for Protective Order and resolving the scope of the\nsubpoena and any enforcement issues, Jane Doe No. 3 voluntarily submits herself to this Court’s\njurisdiction.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015599",
