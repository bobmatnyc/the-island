  "text": "were winners once before. Their cost on the bench, or on the taxi squad, is good\n\ninsurance.\n\nMy version of Hamilton’s parasite theory patched in some of Trivers’ ideas. One was\nthat mothers intuiting self-health and good prospects should tend to breed higher\nprimary sex ratios and conversely. Their male offspring can then find willing mates\nif health carries reliable signs as Hamilton proposed. Also the investment of\ninsurance cost by winners in maintaining losers on the bench can be interpreted as\n\nTrivers’ reciprocal altruism to be recovered when winners now become losers later.\n\nMy discussion of grandparental investment let still more worms out of the can. It is\nclear that humans in advanced economies today normally live to nearly three\ngeneration lengths. I proposed that we are replenishing a total capital reserve,\nmeaning mainly a human capital one, when recovering from hard times in the world\n\nwars and world depression. No one really knows.\n\nChapter 7 Petty’s Idea 2/3/16 30\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011089",
