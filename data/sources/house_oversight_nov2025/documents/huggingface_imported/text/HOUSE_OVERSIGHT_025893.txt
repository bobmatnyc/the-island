Hi Jeff

I really find it amusing. I don't agree with everything he says. But it is fascinating. BB is making "historic
mistakes"(as he likes to blame others) both vis-a-vis Obama as well as in regard to the American Jewry. And
causes a direct damage to IL.

Noam is so sharp and focused. Really impressive.

I did not fully understand how the fallacy he sees in the attitude to the Ants example is related to Big Data
illusions. An area (deep learning) I spent some time recently trying to better penetrate.

Btw, the series of cubic differences should look 7,19,37,61 (not 21).

We greatly enjoyed staying in 62nd.

We plan to be back in the last week of Aug. for several weeks (having some speeches to make)

will you still be in NM?

If positive we might come over for few days.

Pl let us know.

Best

From Nili as well.
