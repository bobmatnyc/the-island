  "text": "wife and belonging to a husband like Robbie. Marriage was bliss for the\nduration of our honeymoon until we had to ride coach on our way to\nBangkok Airport to fly out to Australia. Chatting away with always so\nmuch to say to each other we watched a movie and finally got\ncomfortable leaning up against each other as pillows. We both fell asleep\non the long ride and when we woke up to the sound of the buses brakes\ncoming to a halt we initially realized my purse and Robbie’s wallet with\nall of our money and cards in it was missing. Stranded in the city of\nBangkok was frightening enough as it was but too make matters worse a\nlady looking in her mid-seventies, scrawny and hunched over from an\nobvious lack of nutrition lifted up her skirt to a passer-byer with a she-\nmale hanging off his arm and began smacking her vagina blaring out\n“Look! No cock...Pussy, pussy! Only five baht” repeating herself many\ntimes over the man just walked on past as she sat back down on the curb\nwaiting for the next alluring customer. Robbie and I shook our heads in\ndisgust and disbelief, things could really be that bad for someone, | would\nknow best as it wasn’t far off the life Jeffrey had been training me up for.\n\nCompletely broke at two o’clock in the morning and with no one to call\nfor help, I panicked right away. Robbie rubbed my back and his tired eyes\ntrying to make the situation better. Luckily we had made friends with\nsome really nice people from the resort on the island who gave us about\ntwo thousand baht when they saw how devastated Robbie and I were.\nWith just enough money to rent a really. cheap room for the night at a\nbackpackers hoste! and pay for a taxi to the airport the following day, we\nwere saved.\n\nEarly the next morning we were off in separate planes, since Robbie’s\nticket was pre-booked and no available seats left for me to join him meant\nwe would be landing in Australia separately. Fortunately we had found a\ncorresponding flight that arrived within the same hour of each other but I\nwould have to make a stop over to the Philippines. The lengthy hours of\nthe duration on the flight seemed to stretch on with only the thoughts of\nthe journey ahead of me I couldn’t wait to get back to my husbands\nloving arms. The trip was going well, sleeping the majority of the flight\nuntil I had to change planes in the Philippines.\n\nAfter the plane landed and before any passenger was allowed to get off\nwe were handed a declaration statement that informed us that if we were\ncarrying any drugs or weaponry, we would be arrested and face charges\nwith death as the ultimate penalty. Not that I had anything to worry about,\nbut what a thought to willingly sign over your life. I got the chills\nhanding over my signed declaration and traveling documents to the\ncustoms officer. Obtaining my passport he additionally asked to see my\ndeparting ticket. No problem | thought, just I had done many of times,\nand | handed over the requested information. The officer looked me over\n\n133\n\n£1 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004266\n\nand got on the phone immediately which sounded like a phone call to his\nsuperiors but | couldn’t tell since it was in another language. A brief\nconversation but long enough to get me thinking, he then called over two\nguards who took me by the arms and brought me into an empty room but\nfor a desk and three chairs to be interrogated. No one would tell me what\nwas going on they all just scattered around in frenzy, ignoring all of my\nhysterical inquisitions. Leaving me by myself and alone with my thoughts\nI couldn’t help but panic even worse now.\n\nThis was a total bombshell of confusion on my part, what had | done\nwrong? Minute’s later a large-framed women in a green uniform entered\nthe room with the guards from before and sat down across from me with\na stern look in her eyes. She placed my documents on the desk in between\nus. Not saying a word to me she was waiting for me to give her an\nexplanation for something. “Can you please tell me what this is about,\nhave I done something wrong?” L asked her politely, trying to restraint\nany animosity towards her. Her reply sounded as grim as she looked.\n“You have been in Thailand for three months and now you have only a\none way ticket booked to Australia with no visa. What exactly are your\nplans once you get there, Ms. Roberts?” To myself 1 wondered what\nbusiness it was to her, don’t people travel with one-way tickets all the\ntime? Knowing I was in no position to be able to say anything like that or\neven at all I just gave in nicely and told her my intentions to travel over\nthere. Crying through my entire explanation | wasn’t sure if | was going ~\nto even make my flight now. She had to think about everything | had told\nher fora moment, deciding whether or not she would grant me\npermission to meet my husband in Australia or send me back alone to\nBangkok. With only time on my side she had to make a hasty verdict\nnow. One more question had to be answered before | was let go, she\nwanted some proof. “If you have just got married can you show me your\nmarriage certificate then?” This didn’t help my stories credibility at all\nseeing that we were married in a Buddhist temple and given woven\nbracelets instead of certificates. Explaining to her that I didn’t have one to\nshow her yet but was already aware that I would have to obtain a legal\nmarriage certificate through a courthouse upon my arrival in Australia to\nstay there legally, it was only because of my husbands beliefs we wanted\nto get married in a Buddhist ceremony. She must have shared a common\ninterest in religion or something like that as she finally cracked a smile\nupon the photos of the wedding day that 1 showed her and carrying in my\npurse since getting them developed, if she wanted proof, well this is all I\nreally had.\n\nHanding me back my documents and ticket I was now free to leave but\nshe wasn’t leaving me much time to run through the airports terminal to\nget to my departing plane. Expeditiously bolting through the busy airport\n\n0 Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUTEREO04267\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021211",
