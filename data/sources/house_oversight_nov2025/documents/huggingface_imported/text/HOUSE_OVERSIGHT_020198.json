  "text": "46\n\nInstead of seeking a job in Japan, Snowden sought to join the Special Forces through the 18X\nprogram. It was an Army Reserve program created in 2003 that allowed individuals who had not\nserved in the military or completed their education, to train to be a Special Forces recruit. He\nlisted his religion on the application as “Buddhist” because, as he explained in a sardonic post on\nArs Technica, “Agnostic is strangely absent” from the form.”\n\nHe enlisted in the army reserves on May 7, 2004, according to U.S. Army records. He\nreported for a 10 week basic training at Fort Benning, Georgia. That was standard course for all\nenlistees in the infantry. In August, he began a three-week course in of parachute jumping but did\nnot complete that training. US Army records show he did not complete the training requirements\nand received no commendations. As Snowden put it in his Internet postings, he “washed out.”\nHe was discharged on September 29, 2004, ending his 19 week military career. Snowden would\nlater claim on the Internet that he returned to civilian life because he had injured himself by\nbreaking both legs. An Army spokesman said, however, that he could not confirm that Snowden\ninjured his legs or that he was in fact dropped from the program for medical reasons. Under his\nalias TheTrueHooHa he wrote that “they [the Army] held on to me until the doctors cleared me\nto be discharged, and then after being cleared they held onto me for another month just for shits\nand giggles.” He attributed this treatment in the Army, as he would later attribute his problems in\nthe CIA and NSA, to the inferior intelligence of his superiors, He wrote in his post “Psych\nproblems = dishonorable discharge depending on how much they hate you. Lots of alleged homos\nwere in the hold unit, too, but they only got a general discharge at best.” It is not entirely clear\nwhether or not Snowden actually injured himself. If he had broken his legs, it was not evident to\nJoyce Kinsey, his next door neighbor, who told me that she never saw Snowden on crutches when\nhe returned to his mother’s condominium in September 2004. Whether or not he broke his legs,\nArmy records show that he did not receive a medical discharge. He received an “administrative\ndischarge.” Unlike a medical discharge which is given because a soldier has sustained injuries\nthat prevent him from performing his duties, an administrative discharge is a “morally-neutral”\nform of separation given to a soldier when her or she is deemed for non-medical reasons\ninappropriate for military service. Snowden himself preferred to voice a medical explanation for\nhis severance, just as he had claimed a medical reason for dropping out of high school (and would\nlater claim he needed medical treatment for epilepsy at the NSA.)\n\nWhen he returned home from Fort Benning, Georgia on September 28, 2004, he was 21.\nHaving failed in his attempt to join the Special Forces, he returned to his mother’s condominium\nin Elliott City, where he remained unemployed for several months. He took a job as a security\nguard at the University of Maryland’s Center for Advanced Study of Language. According to his\nArs Technica postings, he worked the night shift from six in the evening to six in the morning.\nBecause intelligence officers took its language courses, Snowden had to take a polygraph exam to\nget the job. After he passed it, he was hired and given his first security clearance But he had\nhigher ambitions than being a campus security guard, It was only a temporary stop gap for him.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020198",
