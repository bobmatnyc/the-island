The depth of the financial\ncrisis and the lackluster pace of the recovery have\nallowed the US to avoid the imbalances that would\ntypically be evident this far into an expansion (see\nSection I of this year’s Outlook). If anything, there\nis scope for spending in cyclical parts of the US\neconomy relative to overall GDP to move toward\nits long-term average (see Exhibit 31).\n\nThere is also less risk of disruptive Federal\nReserve tightening, given how few signs we see\nof economic overheating. Headline inflation\nremains below the Federal Reserve’s 2.0% target,\nand though we expect it to move higher this year,\nnormalizing energy prices are a key driver (see\nExhibit 32). Further, while the November 2016\nunemployment rate of 4.6% suggests the economy\nis near full employment, broader measures of labor\nslack, as well as today’s depressed labor force\nparticipation rate, argue that the central bank is\nnot “behind the curve” (see Exhibit 33). Lastly,\nour expectation for continued modest gains for the\nUS dollar and a rebound in productivity growth\nfrom generational lows (see Exhibit 34) provides a\nnatural offset to inflation pressures, even as wages\ncontinue to rise.\n\nExhibit 33: US Unemployment Indicators\nThere are still signs of slack in the labor market.\n\n% %\n\n14 Overall Employment Population Ratio (Right, Inverted) r 55\n== Unemployment Rate\n\n? 4 Natural Rate of Unemployment*\n\n+ 57\n\n1985 1988 1991 1994 1997 2000 2003 2006 2009 2012 2015\n\nData through November 2016.\nSource: Investment Strategy Group, Federal Reserve Economic Data, Datastream.\n* Long-term rate.\n\nOf equal importance, the Federal Reserve is\nacutely aware of the risks that tighter monetary\npolicy poses to the business cycle, which is\napparent in both its willingness to step back\nfrom planned rate hikes last year as well as\nChair Yellen’s acknowledgment that an “abrupt\ntightening would risk disrupting financial markets\nand perhaps even inadvertently push the economy\ninto recession.”!*!
