At this point, she knew she was entering into a dangerous\nliaison with an unknown party in pursuit of NSA secrets. She won-\ndered if he might be part of a plan to entrap her or her contacts like\nAssange and Appelbaum, as she noted in her diary. “Is C4 a trap?”\nshe asked herself, referring to her Citizen Four source. “Will he put\nme in prison?”\n\nTo elude this “adversary,” Snowden stressed to Poitras that she\nwould have to adopt a conspiratorial frame of mind. “If the device\nyou store the private key and enter your pass phrase on has been\n\n© hacked, it is trivial to decrypt our communications,” he explained. “If ©\nyou publish the source material, I will likely be immediately impli-\ncated.” If her correspondent could be “immediately implicated,” it\nmeant that he was a person authorized to handle these secrets. So\nPoitras knew, as early as January 2013, that she was creating an\nencrypted channel for someone with access to NSA secrets who\nwould be incriminated by providing them to her.\n\nThe key source for Poitras’s previously referred to short video\nwas Binney. Like her new source, he had been authorized to handle\nNSA secrets. Binney had been an NSA technical director until he\nhad retired in 2001. The NSA‘s domestic surveillance program that\nBinney told the press about years before being interviewed in Poi-\ntras’s film was called Stellarwind. It involved data mining domestic\ncommunications and financial transactions that had been authorized\nby President George W. Bush in 2001 after 9/11 as commander-in-\nchief under the war powers given to him following the attacks. It\nindeed led to a major exposé on domestic spying by The New York\nTimes in December 2005.\n\nBinney had never provided Poitras with any NSA documents\n\n| | Epst_9780451494566_2p_all_r1.z.indd 66 ® 9/30/16 11:09 AM | |\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019554",
