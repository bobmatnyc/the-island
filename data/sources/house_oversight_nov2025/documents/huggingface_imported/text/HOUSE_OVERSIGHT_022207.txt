This is the latest screenshot. Mike managed to knock out daily beast again. She is a pain and very very persistent. We
managed to push Huffington post down near bottom and is about to be pushed off, but it would take a bit more
work, and again, you have your active detractors out there. Just the way it is.

On the second page, we have replaced 8 toxic references with good ones, and there are four toxic ones left, which
were pushed off the first page.

The science and org sites would have been placed higher if there was new content created and added.
Mike, however, is stopping work now on the project.
We need to talk about island asap, as they are bugging me for logistics.

‘Thanks.
