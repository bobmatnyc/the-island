  "text": "this perspective, people believe in God\nbecause it is so easy to believe in\ninvisible supernatural presence, and the\ngreat religions are elaborations around\nthis basic core. !\n\nBelief in the Invisible\n\nYet it is also true that in many\nways it is hard for people to believe in\nthe invisible, intentional being of God, at\nleast in some ways and at some times. It\nis one thing to believe in the abstract that\nthere is a good and loving God; it is\nanother thing to believe that this God\nloves you in particular this very\nafternoon when your car has broken\ndown in the rain. Many Christians\nstruggle at some point with whether God\nexists or with whether they understand\nGod’s nature. A young man may come\nto university as a devout Christian, take\na course on religion, and begin to\nwonder whether Christ as well as\nKrishna are cultural constructions. A\ndepressed woman may understand\nherself as devout, but find that when she\nsits down to pray she feels that no one is\nlistening to her prayers. And always\nthere are times when terrible things\nhappen to good and faithful people who\noften continued to believe in God in the\nabstract, but who find that they can not\nlonger pray at all. The struggle between\nespoused religion (the religion one\nasserts; the Nicene creed) and lived\nreligion (the way in which one\nexperiences God from moment to\nmoment) is central to the life of the\nChristian, and perhaps to the lives of\nmost believers.\n\nThe problem for believers is that\nto experience the Christian God as\npresent, one must override three basic\nfeatures of human psychology, features\nthat are also part of our evolutionary\ninheritance. A person must override the\n\n112\n\nPage\n\nexpectation that our minds are private,\nan expectation so substantial that\nresearchers have shown that it develops\naround the world at a more or less\nsimilar age and can be found even in\nnon-human primates. A person must\noverride the expectation that persons are\nvisible. And finally, a person must\noverride the expectation that love is\nconditional, as it is for all social beings\nbeyond a certain age, when right\nbehavior is expected as a condition of\nhuman interaction. At least, some\nversions of Christianity expect\nunconditional love.\n\nThe deep puzzle of faith is not\nwhy but how. How is it possible that\npeople are able to violate such\nfundamental expectations of presence?\nThe answer, in part, is that they do not.\nFor most Christians, it will be a lifelong\nprocess to believe in all times and in all\nways that their God is real for them in\nthe way that their church tells them that\nGod is real. As the psalmist laments:\n“how long wilt thou forget me, Oh Lord?\nFor ever? How long wilt thou hide thy\nface from me?” (Psalm 13: 1). What they\ndo to make God plausible for them\ndepends upon their understanding of\nGod and on what the social world of a\nfaith teaches about how to experience\ntheir minds and bodies to find evidence\nfor God’s presence.\n\nLearning to Sense the Presence of God\n\nIn 2004 I set out to study\nethnographically the way God becomes\nreal for people in a church that would\nexacerbate the cognitive burden of\nbelief. I chose an example of the new\nProtestant church that grew up after the\n1960s. * Those churches set out as an\ninvitation to experience God as\nconcretely and as vividly as God had\nbeen experienced by the earliest\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021358",
