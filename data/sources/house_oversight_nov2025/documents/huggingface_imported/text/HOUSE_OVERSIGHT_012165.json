  "text": "2a\n\n26.\n\nKIRKLAND & ELLIS LLP\nTab 18, December 13, 2007 Letter from M. Villafana (admitting that the notification\noccurred “shortly after the signing”).\n\nAUSA Villafana Misleads Mr. Epstein In An Attempt To Refer Plaintiffs to Her\nBoyfriend’s Close Friend\n\nOn September 25, Ms. Villafana recommended a local products-liability defense\nattomey, Humberto “Bert” Ocariz, Esq., for the highly lucrative post of attorney\nrepresentative for the government’s list of as-yet-undisclosed “victims.”\n\n(a) Ms. Villafana wrote to the defense, “I have never met Bert, but a good friend in\nour appellate section and one of the district judges in Miami are good friends\nwith him and recommended him.” See Tab 28, September 25, 2007 Email from\nM. Villafana to J. Lefkowitz (bottom email) (emphasis added).\n\n(b) Ms, Villafana failed to disclose that this “good friend in our appellate section”\nwas her live-in boyfriend. See Tab 18, December 13, 2007 Letter from M.\nVillafana (conceding the “relationship” with “my boyfriend’).\n\n(c) Beyond her clear conflict-of-interest and affirmative effort to conceal it, it is\nunimaginable that AUSA Villafana would have engaged in an ex-parte\ncommunication with a United States District Judge in the same district about the\ndetails of a pending grand-jury investigation without prior disclosure and\nsupervisory approval.\n\n(d) Later, it became clear that Ms. Villafana also had at least one other ex-parte\ncommunication with that same United States District Judge about the grand jury’s\ninvestigation. See Tab 29, October 5, 2007 Email from M. Villafana to J.\nLefkowitz (stating that “one of the District Judges in Miami mentioned [retired\nJudge Joseph Hatchett] as a good choice” to decide any fee disputes concerning\nEpstein’s paying for a lawyer to represent the unnamed women in claims against\nEpstein).\n\nThe next day, AUSA Villafana advised the defense that she was removing one of the\nalternatives to Mr. Ocariz from our consideration, on the basis that “one of his partners is\nmarried to an AUSA here,” and explained that, because of that personal relationship,\n\nThese actions were improper. As you know, the Department prohibits employees from using any nonpublic\ninformation to secure private benefits of any kind: “An employee shall not ... allow the improper use of\nnonpublic information to further his own private interest or that of another, whether through advice or\nrecommendation, or by knowing unauthorized disclosure.” 5 C.F.R. § 2635.703 (emphasis added). Among\nthe examples of prohibited disclosure specifically illustrated by this regulation is the disclosure of nonpublic\ninformation to “friends” to further their financial interests, id., at Example 1, and the disclosure of nonpublic\ninformation to a newspaper reporter, id., at Example 5 (see allegations below regarding the leak to the New York\nTimes). Furthermore, the Justice Department prohibits its employees from using their position to benefit friends\nor relatives. See 5. C.F.R. § 2635.702; see also 5. C.F.R. § 2535.502.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_012165",
