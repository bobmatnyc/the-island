A “foreign state” is\nstatutorily defined:\n(a) A “foreign state” ... includes a po-\nlitical subdivision of a foreign state or an\nagency or instrumentality of a foreign\nstate as defined in subsection (b).\n(b) An “agency or instrumentality of a\nforeign state” means any entity -\n(1) which is a separate legal person,\ncorporate or otherwise, and\n(2) which is an organ of a foreign\nstate or political subdivision thereof,\nor a majority of whose shares or other\nownership interest is owned by a for-\neign state or political subdivision\nthereof, and\n(8) which is neither a citizen of a\nState of the United States ... nor\ncreated under the laws of any third\ncountry.\n28 U.S.C. § 1603. There is no dispute\nthat the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is a\nforeign state. The status of each of the\nPrinces and NCB are discussed below.\n\n1. Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\n\nSeveral courts have recognized that\n“Cilmmunity under the FSIA extends also\nto agents of a foreign state acting in their\nofficial capacities [since] ‘i]t is generally\nrecognized that a suit against an individual\nacting in his official capacity is the prac-\ntical equivalent of a suit against the sover-\neign directly’”™ Bryks v. Canadian\nBroad. Corp. 906 F.Supp. 204, 210\n(S.D.N.Y.1995) (quoting Chuidian v. Phil-\nippine Natl Bank, 912 F.2d 1095, 1101\n(9th Cir.1990) (“Nowhere in the text or\nlegislative history does Congress state that\nindividuals are not encompassed within 28\nU.S.C. § 1603(b).”)); see also Velasco v.\nGov't of Indonesia, 370 F.8d 392, 398-99\n(4th Cir.2004) (collecting cases extending\n\n23. The FSIA is silent on the subject. Neither\nthe Supreme Court nor the Second Circuit\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nFSIA immunity to individuals sued in their\nofficial capacities); Byrd v. Corporacion\nForestal y Industrial de Olancho S.A., 182\nF.3d 380, 388 (th Cir.1999) (acknowl-\nedging the FSIA protects individuals to\nthe extent they act within their official\nduties); El-Fadl v. Cent. Bank of Jordan,\n75 F.3d 668, 671 (D.C.Cir.1996) (dismissing\nclaims against government officials since\nthey were sued in their official capacities);\nLeutwyler, 184 F.Supp.2d at 286-87 [I]t\nhas been generally recognized that individ-\nuals employed by a foreign state’s agencies\nor instrumentalities are deemed ‘foreign\nstates’ when they are sued for actions un-\ndertaken within the scope of their official\ncapacities.”) (citing Bryks, 906 F.Supp. at\n210); Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran,\n999 F.Supp. 1, 11 n. 3 (D.D.C.1998) (noting\nfavorable practice of applying FSIA to in-\ndividuals). Thus, this Court finds that im-\nmunity may be available to Prince Sultan,\nas the third-highest ranking member of\nthe Saudi government, and to Prince\nTurki, as the Director of Saudi Arabia’s\nDepartment of General Intelligence, to the\nextent their alleged actions were per-\nformed in their official capacities.\n\n[10] The Federal Plaintiffs argue that\nthe FSIA cannot apply to Prince Turki\nbecause, as of September 10, 2003 when\nthe complaint was filed, Prince Turki was\nthe Saudi ambassador to the United King-\ndom, a position the Federal Plaintiffs al-\nlege is not entitled to immunity under the\nFSIA. In support of this argument, the\nFederal Plaintiffs cite Dole Food Co. v.\nPatrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 480, 123 S.Ct.\n1655, 155 L.Ed.2d 643 (2003), in which the\nSupreme Court held that instrumentality\nstatus is determined at the time of the\nfiling of the complaint.\n\nhas specifically addressed the issue.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017853",
