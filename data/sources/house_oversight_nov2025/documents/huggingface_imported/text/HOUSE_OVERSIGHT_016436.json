  "text": "in 2008, witnesses and alleged victims testified in civil court that there were\n\nhundreds of girls who were brought to Epstein’s homes, including girls from\n\nEurope, Latin America and former Soviet Republic countries.\n\nBut Acosta and Epstein’s armada of attorneys — Harvard professor Alan\nDershowitz, Jay Lefkowitz, Gerald Lefcourt, Jack Goldberger, Roy Black, Guy\nLewis and former Whitewater special prosecutor Kenneth Starr — reached a\nconsensus: Epstein would never serve time in a federal or state prison.\n\nREAD NEXT\n\nLOCAL |\n\nSex abuser Jeffrey Epstein was surrounded by powerful people. Here’s a sampling\n\nNOVEMBER 28, 2018 8:00 AM\n\nPOLICE UNDER PRESSURE\n\nThere were really just two people willing to risk their careers to go after Epstein:\nPalm Beach Police Chief Michael Reiter and Detective Joseph Recarey.\n\nFor Reiter, business tycoon Jeffrey Epstein wasn’t any more formidable than any\nof the other 8,000 or so wealthy and powerful people living on the island. Police\nhad handled sensational cases involving wealthy residents before — from the\nmurders of heiresses to the rape case involving William Kennedy Smith, of the\nKennedy family.\n\nThe easternmost town in Florida, Palm Beach is a 10.4-square-mile barrier island\nbetween the Intracoastal Waterway and the Atlantic Ocean populated by some of\nthe richest people in the country. President Trump has his “winter White House”\nin Palm Beach, and the town makes news as much for its glitz as it does for its\nunusual efforts to preserve its well-mannered image, like banning shirtless\n\njoggers.\n\nBut it was a little surprising, even to Reiter, to learn that one of its residents had a\nrevolving door of middle and high school girls coming to his gated compound\nthroughout the day and night.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016436",
