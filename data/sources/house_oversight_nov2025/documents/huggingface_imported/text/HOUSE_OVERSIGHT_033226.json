VIX so low, etc. \nYou must get a lot of this in talking to clients -- people freaking out about headlines as markets hit \nnew highs. How do you spin this to them? One hedgie Trump supporter told me that Trump is the \nhighest beta prez ever -- ie the highs will be high but so will be the lows. \nQuestion: how closely does DJT track market moves? I know he tweets about Dow 20,000 but how \naware do you think he is about how market really betting big on him. Does he talk to Barrack about \nthis? Cohn? \nLandon Thomas, Jr. \nFinancial Reporter \nNew York Times \nhttp://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/landon jr thomas/index.h  \ntml \nHOUSE OVERSIGHT 033226",
