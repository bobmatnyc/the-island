It failed to recognize the\npossibility that countries like Japan and China might take roads to\nmodernity that would look very different from the ones pioneered by\nBritain and the United States. But even if one agreed that the end\npoint of development should be some form of industrialized liberal\ndemocracy, Huntington made it clear that arriving at the desired\ndestination was far more elusive and complicated than modernization\ntheorists believed.\n\nThe central piece of policy advice that emerged out of Huntington’s\nwork was the concept of the “authoritarian transition.” If political\nsystems opened up to democratic contestation too early, before the\ndevelopment of political parties, labor unions, professional\nassociations and other organizations that could structure\nparticipation, the result could be chaotic. Authoritarian regimes that\ncould maintain order and promote economic growth, Huntington\nargued, might oversee a more gradual institutionalization of society,\nand make a transition to democracy only when broad participation\ncould be peacefully accommodated. This form of sequencing, in\nwhich economic development was promoted before a democratic\nopening, was the path followed by Asian countries like South Korea\nand Taiwan, which made democratic transitions in the late 1980s only\nafter they had succeeded in turning themselves into industrialized\npowerhouses.
