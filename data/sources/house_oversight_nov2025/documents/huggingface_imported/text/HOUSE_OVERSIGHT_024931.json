  "text": "This is the second time that I have responded to your questions online; the first time was eight years ago, when\nInternet communications were still in the nascent stage -- although, I must say, Dubai and the United Arab\nEmirates had already made noteworthy progress in this field. During that initial online interview, my objective\nwas to stimulate the interest of the Emirati community in the Internet when the use of the online\ncommunications was relatively limited.\n\nToday the usage of the Internet across the UAE has come to be taken for granted; in fact, the Web has been\nadopted so extensively in both the public and private sectors that e-communications are the norm rather than the\nexception. We see that a large segment of our society, especially young people, believe that the Internet is the\nmost important source of information, education and entertainment.\n\nThe UAE continues to lead the Arab world in adoption of information and communication technology\naccording to the annual global infor mation technology report released before yesterday.\n\nLittle wonder, then, that I get inundated with questions from citizens and media alike. That’s why I have chosen\nto meet with you via my Web site. I think hosting this encounter online will allow all of you to ask as many\nquestions as you wish. In the last few days alone, I have received hundreds of questions from several local and\nregional newspapers. Naturally, there was some overlapping of questions since they came from so many\ndifferent sources. Hence, I have tried to consolidate my answers in such a manner that I do not come across as\nrepetitious.\n\nThis “interview,” of course, relates to questions from the media, whose work I consider especially significant in\ntelling the story of how Dubai and the UAE are coping successfully with the global financial crisis, and how our\ndevelopment plans are being advanced with the resilience and determination that has always characterized\nEmirati society.\n\nI have also received many questions from everyday Emiratis, and these will be answered in a subsequent\ncommunication.\n\nIn the meantime, I hope my responses will generate positive discussion about the issues and values that Dubai\nand the UAE care about — the strengthening ofa society that’s anchored in unique Emirati traditions, and the\ncontinued building of a global city to which all are welcome, a city that is well integrated in the fast changing\nglobal commons that we all must share. Dubai is not only a catalyst of change; it is an exemplar of change. And\nI am proud of that, just as Iam proud of the economic and social contributions that Emiratis and their well-\nwishers have made over these years to furthering the Dubai Vision.\n\nAl Hayat Newspaper - Shafiq Al Asadi\n\nYour Highness, Dubai, the famous city known for its outstanding experience on both\nregional and international levels, has been recently criticized for its development\nstrategy in the light of the global financial crisis. How do you perceive this campaign and\nhow are you dealing with it?\n\nCriticism and negative statements do not really disturb me. We do not mind receiving objective criticism that\nhelps us improving our services and methods. If there were negative aspects, then we will address them and\nwork toward revamping them. But following the global financial crisis, what we read and heard was not in\nreference to the negative aspects. In fact it was a \"media bombardment\" targeted at the UAE as a model for a\nfederal state, a successful and prosperous Arab country. And Dubai, the city that has set up a successful\neconomic model at a global level, was under a daily attack by some Western media, as if they were in a race\nagainst time to harm the UAE.\n\nAs for the motives of the campaign, God Almighty knows. But it seems that the success of the Arab, whether\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024931",
