  "text": "Page 36 of 52\n2005 B.Y.U.L. Rev. 835, *896\n\nto full and timely restitution as provided in law.\" 7°? As a practical matter, many of the calculations supporting a restitution\naward will rest on information in the presentence report. While the restitution statutes have their own detailed procedural\n\nprovisions, 7°4\n\nthe presentence report is clearly a central part of the restitution process. If a presentence report fails to\naccurately recount restitution figures, crime victims may be short-changed. For all these reasons, the CVRA should be\nunderstood as giving victims the right to review relevant parts of the presentence report and to be heard before a court makes\nany final conclusions about Guidelines calculations and other sentencing issues. Many states follow a similar approach and\ngive victims access to the presentence report. 7>°\n\nIn February 2005, I testified before the Sentencing Commission to recommend a change in the U.S. Sentencing Commission\nGuidelines Manual along the lines of the proposals contained in this [*897] Article. *°° In particular, I suggested that the\nCommission change its current rule, which allows only the parties to see the presentence report. 7°’ The Practitioners’\n\nAdvisory Group to the Sentencing Commission later disputed my proposal. In a letter to the Commission, 7*8\n\nthey argued that\n\"nothing in the CVRA or its legislative history states that crime victims should be permitted to review portions of the\npresentence report, dispute guidelines calculations, raise grounds for departure, or, as such rights would seem to imply, appeal a\nsentence on factual or legal grounds.\" 7°? The Practitioners’ Group also cited the drafting history of the proposed constitutional\namendment protecting victims’ rights, which they thought was limited to giving a victim merely the right to \"allocute\" at\nsentencing - that is, merely to provide victim impact information. 7°°\n\nThe Practitioners' Group's arguments are flawed for several reasons. First, the Group too narrowly views the relevant legislative\nhistory of the CVRA. As explained above, Congress intended for victims to have broad rights in the sentencing process,\nincluding rights to be reasonably heard in a meaningful manner. 7°! It is not reasonable to deprive victims of the critical\ninformation in the presentence report. Second, the Practioners' Group inaccurately describes the relevant history of the Victims’\nRights Amendment. It is true that the proposed constitutional amendment contained a right to be \"reasonably heard,\" just as the\nCVRA does. However, the Practitioner's Group fails to recognize that the legislative history of the amendment suggests that\n\n253 18 ULS.C.A. 3771(a)(6) (West 2004 & Supp. 2005).\n254 18 U.S.C. 3664.\n\n25 Ala.
