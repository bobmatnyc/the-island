I was the Island’s\n\nmanager\n\n> from 1999 through 2007 and lived on the Island with my\nwife\n\n> during that entire period. Regarding President\n\n> Clinton, I will sign a sworn affidavit that I never met\nthe\n\n>man. As far as I know President Clinton was never on\n> the Island. He was never there while I was present\n\non\n\n>the Island. If he had come to the Island while I was\n\n> on holiday, my staff would have told me that President\n> Clinton was on the Island while I was away. While I\n\n> worked on Little St. James, I had been called back\nfrom\n\n> holiday many times to help when any guests visited the\n> Island. So, if President Clinton had come to the\n\n> Island while I was away, I would have been called back\nto\n\n> the Island for such a visit, and J never was.\n\n> The same is true for Vice President Gore and his wife\n> Tipper. I never met them and as far as I am\n\n> aware were never on Little St. James during the entire\n> period that I was the Island manager.\n\n>\n\n> Sincerely,\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_026358",
