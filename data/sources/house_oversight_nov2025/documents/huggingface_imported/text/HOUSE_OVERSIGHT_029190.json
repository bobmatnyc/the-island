It is Oct 19th. I was previously invited to give a\nmajor lecture in Heidelberg Oct 14 but they had to cancel it after the university determination re australia was\npublicized by the bitch. That air ticket, which they had paid fo, was about 5250 euros. There is a $900\ncancellation fee, and they have agreed to let me keep the ticket if I pay them 4500 euros. I offered that to the\nother place but they only have $5K USD total, which includes the $4K fee they originally offered me. Iam\ngoing to check other tickets now, but wanted to know if you might be flying to europe around then and could\ntake a hitchhiker. :)\n\nLawrence M.
