  "text": "Paul Keating explains as never before\n\ne BY:PAUL KELLY, EDITOR-AT-LARGE\n° From:The Australian\ne October 22, 2011 12:00AM\n\nWITH his panoramic view of world affairs sharper than ever, Paul Keating blames the current global crisis\non blunders by European and US leaders and warns that Australia must rediscover the keys to national\nsuccess.\n\nInterviewed in his Sydney office, furnished in a style he calls \"the last gasp of revolutionary classicism\", Keating's\nnew 600-plus page book sits atop his desk, an insight into his intellectual, aesthetic and political obsessions.\n\nWhat has Keating been doing since he left office in 1996? He has been travelling, speaking and analysing the world\nand Australia with undiminished intensity suggesting a man operating as prime minister-in-exile.\n\nHis idea of leadership is more philosophical than ever, more distant from Bob Hawke or John Howard. His focus is\nthe synthesis between beauty and reason and his book encompasses China's currency, the world malaise, Mahler's\nSymphony No2 and broaching the republic with the Queen.\n\nDuring the interview Keating talks, as never before, about his leadership concept. But he is doing something else:\nexplaining himself to a still puzzled nation.\n\n\"The great changes in civilisation and society have been wrought by deeply held beliefs and passion rather than by\na process of rational deduction,\" Keating tells me. In retirement, his political inspiration comes from music and\nbeauty, not opinion polls.\n\nThere are signs he has mellowed. While ruthless with his judgments Keating is keen to support a struggling Labor\nParty while addressing the source of its strategic demise.\n\n\"The failure of the Rudd and Gillard administrations is the lack of an over-arching story, the lack of a compelling\nstory,\" he says when interviewed last week.\n\n\"I'm happy that Labor took us through this dreadful financial crisis so competently. But they are not in the business\nof teaching. And governments, to succeed with change, must be in the business of educating the community.\n\n“Our Labor governments have failed to conceptualise the changes. We need a framework.\n\n\"What is the framework? It is ‘Australia in Transition’ strategically and economically. That's the story we have to\npresent.\n\n\"| think the Australian people are very conscientious. During the 1980s and 1990s we proved they will respond\nconscientiously to necessary reforms. They mighin't like them but they'll accept them. But reforms have to be\npresented in a digestible format.\n\n\"| know that in the age of the internet, opinion and perpetual static it is difficult to get the message over. | accept\nthat. But the big messages have their own momentum. If we get the story of transition right then other things will find\n\ntheir place.\n\n“Our problem is what | call shooting-star policies. We have a policy on carbon pricing, on minerals, on boatpeople,\nbut they are not connected up to the big picture about Australia's direction and its transition.\"\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029560",
