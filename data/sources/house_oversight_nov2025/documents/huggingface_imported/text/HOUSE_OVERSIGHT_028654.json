Jeffrey and Thomas\nPickering addressed a Policy Forum at The Washington Institute.\nAmbassador Jeffrey, a former assistant to the president and deputy\nnational security advisor, is author of the new Institute study Moving to\nDecision: U.S. Policy toward Iran. Ambassador Pickering served in\nnumerous key posts at home and abroad over a five-decade career,\nincluding undersecretary of state for political affairs. The following is a\nrapporteur's summary of their remarks.\n\nJAMES F. JEFFREY\n\nThe move to decision on Iran is the most pressing and dangerous issue on\nthe U.S. and international agenda in 2013. The year ahead will largely\ndefine the longstanding struggle between Washington and Tehran, and the\nconsiderable stakes involved make it absolutely crucial that a swift and\ndecisive resolution be achieved. Regardless of the outcome of the nuclear\nissue, however, Iran will continue to present a long-term challenge to the\nUnited States because of clashing ideologies, conflicting foreign policy\ngoals, and Iran's claim to regional hegemony.\n\nThere are four likely outcomes to the nuclear issue: a unilateral Iranian\ndecision to halt or dramatically slow its progress toward a nuclear weapon;\na negotiated outcome, whether through the P5+1 (1.e., the five permanent\nmembers of the UN Security Council plus Germany) or bilateral\nnegotiations; a military strike, as threatened by President Obama and\nIsraeli prime minister Binyamin Netanyahu; and an explicit or implicit\nshift to containment, indicating that Washington would be prepared to\ncoexist with a nuclear-armed Iran.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028654",
