Initially she intended to sign the contract, but later on she came across that article in internet about\nyou involved in illegal activities with young models. This information somehow changed her intentions\ncompletely. she is ready to be a model and consider contracts with other agencies, but she has\nsuspicions that you will force her to illegal activities and she made the decision to don't put her self in risk.\n\nLets keep in touch. | will be happy to work with you next time if we have another right model for you. Im\nupset that it didn't work out with Liza\n\nSincerely,\nVladimir\n\nEXHIBIT C\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011960",
