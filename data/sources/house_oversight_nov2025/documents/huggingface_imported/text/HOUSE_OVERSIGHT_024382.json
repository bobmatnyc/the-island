One was\nsingled out and placed under arrest. But before you could say\nnonviolent demonstration, the police car was surrounded, its\ncaptors reaching as many as 3,000 students. During the late\nevening, bored fraternity men gathered and tossed lighted\ncigarettes and eggs on those sitting in the plaza. The\n\ndemonstrators responded with silence.\n\nNext day, 450 police assembled on campus to remove the\ncop car and its arrested inhabitant, but an agreement to\nnegotiate was reached and the demonstrators dispersed. One of\nthe folk songs to come out of the Free Soeech Movement was /f\n/ Negotiate With You to the tune of the Beatles’ /f/Fe// in Love\nWith You.\n\nOver the next couple of months there was a series of sit-ins\nand attempted negotiations, and then, on December 2, the\n\ninfamous Sproul Hall sit-in. It took twelve hours for 800 students\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024382",
