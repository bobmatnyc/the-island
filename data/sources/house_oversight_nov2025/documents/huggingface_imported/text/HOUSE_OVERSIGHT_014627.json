  "text": "Catalysts: Stable Aerospace earnings & US defense spending\n\nOperating weakness for Bombardier’s Global family, which competes with the\nGulfstream family, has weighed down investor sentiment for large cabin business jets\nand General Dynamics. However, Gulfstrear’s more conservative production rates,\nattractive product positioning, higher quality backlog, and better operating performance\ncompared to Bombardier lower Gulfstream’s near- and medium-term earnings risks, in\nour view. The key catalyst for General Dynamics is the upcoming earnings result that\ndemonstrates how EBIT in the Aerospace segment remains stable despite a more tepid\nmarket outlook from Bombardier.\n\nWe continue to view GD as a beneficiary of positive inflection in US defense spending.\nWe expect the recent Republican victory in the White House and the Senate to be seen\nas incrementally positive for defense. Political control is a key driver of defense\nspending, and defense stock valuations are tied to changes in defense spending related\nto the modernization accounts. Our Political Control Model (PCM) analysis highlights a\nRepublican President and Republican Senate is the best case for Budget Authority in\ndefense modernization accounts. Our PCM analysis suggests that the Republican sweep\ncould increase the Budget Authority for defense investment accounts by a CAGR of 12-\n13% (FY17E-21E). This compares to the BofAML forecast of a 5% CAGR and the FY17\nGreen Book forecast of a 1% CAGR.\n\nAdditionally, GD’s Marine Systems segment is a direct beneficiary of the US pivot to the\nPacific. The Pacific is a hotbed of maritime activity particularly as China expands its\nterritorial waters. As the US focus on naval superiority strengthens, we might see upside\nto shipbuilding spending.\n\nLatest report: General Dynamics: Gulfstream still undervalued; raise PO to\n$200 and reiterate Buy 30 November 2016\n\n1Q risks: large cabin business jets market deterioration and US defense spending\nThere is risk of market deterioration in large cabin business jets that could increase\nearnings risks for Gulfstream. Additionally, delays in government contracting or lower\nthan expected increase in US defense spending could provide downside risks to our\nestimates.\n\nCompany Description\n\nGeneral Dynamics is a major US government contractor engaged in combat vehicles and\nsystems, armaments, munitions, ordnance, shipbuilding and information systems and\ntechnologies. It is also the parent company of Gulfstream in its Aerospace segment,\nwhich is the most profitable airplane manufacturing company in the world.\n\nConsolidated Edison (ED)\n\nBrian Chin +1 646 855 5855\nResearch Analyst, MLPF&S\n\nUnderperform, PO $59\n\n1Q17 investment thesis\n\nSince the November elections, utility valuations have not adequately adjusted to the\nrapid shift towards a rising-rate environment and have decoupled from historically\npredicative valuation patterns. Looking at studies of 10yr Yields v. Utility PEs, BBB\nYields v. Utility PEs, and Utility Div. Yields v.
