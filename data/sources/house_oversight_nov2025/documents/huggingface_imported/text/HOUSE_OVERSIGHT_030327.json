  "text": "Political experts told The Oregonian on Tuesday that Roberts’ reply completely railroaded\nhis chances of unseating Walden in a race that was already said to be a longshot.\n\n“If he wins, Pll sell my house and donate to charity,” joked Jim Moore, political science\nprofessor at Pacific University.\n\nRoberts is apparently known for making crude and outlandish remarks on Twitter, most of\nwhich have been aimed at politicians.\n\n“#NikkiHaley very hot,” he once tweeted, in reference to a TV appearance she made last\nyear.\n\n“Important stuff,” Roberts added.\n\nDescribing Illinois Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris, the independent candidate tweeted:\n“Hot, tough & smart!”\n\nCommenting on a video featuring President Trump, he said: “It looks like he’s morphing\ninto a woman, get that man a haircut and non fat chocolate cake!”\n\nIn response to the social media backlash he’s been receiving, Roberts refused to apologize\nand instead cited the Constitution.\n\n“It’s that whole 1st amendment thing,” he tweeted on Tuesday, along with an official\nexplanation from Twitter as to why his tweet about Melania hasn’t been taken down.\n\n“We have investigated the reported content and could not identify any violations,” a\nspokesperson said. “Accordingly, we have not taken any action at this time.”\n\nRichard Kahn\n\nHBRK Associates Inc.\n\n575 Lexington Avenue, 4th Floor\nNew York, NY 10022\n\nPhone\n\na\nCl\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030327",
