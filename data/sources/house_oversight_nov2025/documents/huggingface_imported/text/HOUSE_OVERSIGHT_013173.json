  "text": "13.4 Knowledge Representation via Attractor Neural Networks 257\n\nN\nhg = S WikPk\nk=1,kAi,j\n\n1\nAw = — (pips — hisps — hyivi)\n\n13.4.2 Knowledge Representation via Cell Assemblies\n\nHopfield nets and their ilk play a dual role: as computational algorithms, and as conceptual\nmodels of brain function. In CogPrime they are used as inspiration for slightly different, artificial\neconomics based computational algorithms; but their hypothesized relevance to brain function\nis nevertheless of interest in a CogPrime context, as it gives some hints about the potential\nconnection between low-level neural net mechanics and higher-level cognitive dynamics.\n\nHopfield nets lead naturally to a hypothesis about neural knowledge representation, which\nholds that a distinct mental concept is represented in the brain as either:\n\n1. a set of “cell assemblies”, where each assembly is a network of neurons that are interlinked\nin such a way as to fire in a (perhaps nonlinearly) synchronized manner\n\n2. adistinct temporal activation pattern, which may occur in any one (or more) of a particular\nset of cell assemblies\n\nFor instance, this hypothesis is perfectly coherent if one interprets a “mental concept” as a\nSMEPH (defined in Chapter 14) ConceptNode, i.e. a fuzzy set of perceptual stimuli to which\nthe organism systematically reacts in different ways. Also, although we will focus mainly on\ndeclarative knowledge here, we note that the same basic representational ideas can be applied\nto procedural and episodic knowledge: these may be hypothesized to correspond to temporal\nactivation patterns as characterized above.\n\nIn the biology literature, perhaps the best-articulated modern theories championing the cell\nassembly view are those of Gunther Palm [Pal&82, HAGO7] and Susan Greenfield [SF05, CSGO7].\nPalm focuses on the dynamics of the formation and interaction assemblies of cortical columns.\nGreenfield argues that each concept has a core cell assembly, and that when the concept rises\nto the focus of attention, it recruits a number of other neurons beyond its core characteristic\nassembly into a “transient ensemble.”!\n\nIt’s worth noting that there may be multiple redundant assemblies representing the same\nconcept — and potentially recruiting similar transient assemblies when highly activated. The\nimportance of repeated, slightly varied copies of the same subnetwork has been emphasized by\nEdelman [Ede93] among other neural theorists.\n\n1 The larger an ensemble is, she suggests, the more vivid it is as a conscious experience; an hypothesis that\naccords well with the hypothesis made in [Goe06b] that a more informationally intense pattern corresponds to\na more intensely conscious quale — but we don’t need to digress extensively onto matters of consciousness for\nthe present purposes.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013173",
