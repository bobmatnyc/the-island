Hi Richard -

I certainly will. But perhaps you can clarify something for me before I put all this together for the donation.
Jeffrey Epstein had asked to submit the letter and invoice to Peggy Siegal instead, and she had supplied
different information than below.

Please advice how best to proceed.

Best,
Steven
