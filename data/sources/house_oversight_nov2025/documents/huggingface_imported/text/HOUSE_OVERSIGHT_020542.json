According to sources close to the deal, Phoenix structured the offer to avoid a\nUS law that limits foreign ownership of US radio stations to 25 percent. In filings with\nthe Federal Communications Commission, Phoenix was listed as owning 20 percent of\nthe US-based investor, RBC, while the remaining 80 percent was owned by an editor\n\nat Phoenix who is also a US citizen.’ Under such a setup, no FCC regulations would\nhave been broken. To be extra sure that the deal would go through, however, advisors\nto Phoenix convinced the Hong Kong company to seek approval from the Committee\non Foreign Investment in the United States (CFIUS), a Treasury Department bureau\nthat monitors foreign investments in the United States on national security grounds.\nIn a ruling that surprised the potential investors, CFIUS declined to approve the deal,\nreferring it to then-president Obama. Sources close to the deal noted that the fact that a\nPhoenix employee in the United States had pleaded guilty to espionage-related charges\ndid not help Phoenix’s case.'* RBC pulled out of the deal on September 25, 2013.\n\nBut the efforts to break into the L.A. radio market did not end there.

In addition, through its\nmarketing arm, China Watch, the paper began distributing English-language content\ndirectly as advertising inserts in the Wall Street Journal, the Des Moines Register, and the\nWashington Post, among other leading US newspapers. Often, it’s hard to tell that China\nWatch’s material is an ad, as was the case highlighted by President Donald Trump with\nan advertising insert in the Sunday Des Moines Register—an insert that the president\nsuggested was aimed at undermining political support both for the president and the\n\nRepublican party.’” Rough estimates from newspaper executives indicate that China\n\nSection 6\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020542",
