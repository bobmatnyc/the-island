He accused Ransome’s attorney, powerhouse lawyer David Boies, of inventing the\nstory and using her and another woman, Virginia Roberts, to frame him. Roberts asserted in a\nfederal court affidavit in 2015 that Epstein forced her to have sex with Dershowitz when she was\n16 years old.\n\n“T am the victim. David Boies and these women are the perpetrators,” Dershowitz said. “They\nhave willfully and deliberately concocted stories in order to make money — millions and\nmillions of dollars. And I will not rest until the entire story comes out,” said Dershowitz, a\nprofessor at Harvard Law School and frequent Fox news guest commentator.\n\nNowhere in the court case or the transcript does Ransome or anyone else allege that Ransome\nhad sex with Dershowitz — only that she was directed to.\n\nThe Ransome settlement, which is confidential, comes two weeks after Epstein settled another\nlawsuit in Palm Beach, filed by an attorney who represented several women who said they were\ncoerced into sex acts with Epstein when they were underage. As part of the settlement, Epstein,\n65, issued an apology to Fort Lauderdale attorney Bradley Edwards, admitting that he leveled\nfalse claims in a lawsuit as part of an effort to intimidate Edwards into abandoning his\naggressive advocacy for the women, who are now in their late 20s and early 30s.\n\nThe developments follow a series of stories published by the Miami Herald in late November\nthat detailed how state and federal prosecutors worked with Epstein’s lawyers to conceal the\nextent of Epstein’s crimes, and secretly negotiated an unusual plea agreement that allowed him\nto escape federal sex trafficking charges that could have sent him to prison for life. The\nagreement, by design, was kept from his victims so that they could not appear at his sentencing.\n\nLast week, more than two dozen lawmakers in Washington demanded a federal investigation\ninto that plea deal, which was negotiated, signed and sealed by former Miami U.S. Attorney\nAlexander Acosta, now President Donald Trump’s secretary of labor.\n\nAcosta has not commented on the Herald story or on the calls\nfor a probe into how he handled the Epstein case.\n\nThis week, a decade after defending Epstein, Dershowitz once\nagain found himself in the spotlight amid the new allegations,\nmentioned briefly in a court filing on Nov. 28, and first\nreported on Tuesday by the New York Daily News.\n\nDuring a Nov. 7 hearing, Maxwell’s lawyer, Laura Menninger,\nmentioned Dershowitz’s name as among those “third parties”\nthat Ransome claims she was instructed to have sex with,\naccording to a transcript of the hearing obtained by the Herald.\n\nOn Tuesday, after the Daily News published its story,\nDershowitz lashed out in dozens of posts on Twitter,\ndenouncing Ransome as “delusional” and claiming that her\n\nAlan Dershowitz says he has never met\nlawyer, Boies, was retaliating against him because Dershowitz the woman who alleges in a lawsuit she\nhad filed a bar complaint against him. was ordered to have sex with influential\nmen, including the famous lawyer.
