Further, most large\nprivate companies maintain their books and records to facilitate the\npreparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP to comply\nwith financial institutions’ lending requirements.\n\n247 See SEC v.

Congress added the language in sub-\nsection 78m(b)(6) to the FCPA in 1988, recognizing that “it is\nunrealistic to expect a minority owner to exert a disproportionate degree\nof influence over the accounting practices ofa subsidiary.” H.R. Rep.\n\nNo. 100-576, at 917. The Conference Report noted that, with respect\n\nto minority owners, “the amount of influence which an issuer may\nexercise necessarily varies from case to case. While the relative degree of\nownership is obviously one factor, other factors may also be important in\ndetermining whether an issuer has demonstrated good-faith efforts to use\nits influence.” Jd; see also S. Rep. No. 100-85, at 50.\n\n*5° Section 20(e) of the Exchange Act, titled “Prosecution of Persons\nWho Aid and Abet Violations,’ explicitly provides that for purposes of\n\na civil action seeking injunctive relief or a civil penalty, “any person that\nknowingly or recklessly provides substantial assistance to another person\nin violation of a provision of this title, or of any rule or regulation issued\nunder this title, shall be deemed to be in violation of such provision to\nthe same extent as the person to whom such assistance is provided.” See\nSection 20(e) of the Exchange Act, 15 US.C. § 78t(e).\n\n251 See Complaint at 11-12, SEC».
