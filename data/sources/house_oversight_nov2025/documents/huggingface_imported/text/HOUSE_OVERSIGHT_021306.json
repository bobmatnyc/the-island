  "text": "understanding the behavior of others. If\nyour brain mirrors the neural activity in\nthe brain of someone you see acting, this\ncould provide a basis for understanding\nthe motivation for the action. If your\nbrain resonates to the observed action as\nif you were acting, this could call to\nmind previous experiences acting that\nway providing a memory for why you\nacted that way. That is, our social brain\nmay directly resonate to the actions of\nothers without reasoning explicitly about\nthose actions. This kind of mechanism,\nthrough which intentions might be\ninferred, could then prepare responses\nquickly to facilitate the smooth flow of\nsocial interactions whether in a game or\na dialogue. Of course, a critical aspect\nof such a mechanism is to differentiate\nour resonance to other people’s actions\nand the control of our own. This kind\nof neural system for mapping the actions\nand intentions of others has been\nidentified with a network of regions\ncalled the mirror neuron system °, and\nthis system may help to induce a degree\nof reflexive similarity or identification\nbetween self and other. The mirror\nneuron system appears to be\ncontinuously engaged unless it is\nactively suppressed by inhibition, so that\nthis system may continuous monitor the\nbehavior of ‘others’ in our social\nenvironment.\n\nOf course, mapping the\nmovements of the opponent is useful,\nbut certainly not sufficient to defend our\nposition, score a point, or win a match.\nOne needs to execute countermoves.\nThis is the domain of the motor system\nin the brain, which includes regions\ninvolved in the preparation and\nexecution of motor action. The motor\nsystem is responsible for the\nimplementation of one’s goals and\nintentions to perform an action®. Thus,\n\nPage | 60\n\nthe social brain includes monitoring and\nmotor systems that function in parallel.\nThe mirror system puts the player in the\nopponent’s shoes and monitors the\nopponent’s actions in an anticipatory\nmanner. Other parts of the social brain\nmaintain the distinction between player\nand opponent by shaping the\nimplementation of one’s actions, namely\nby engaging a counteraction.\n\nIn sum, a tennis game or any\nsocial interaction depends on a complex\nnetwork of brain regions that mediate\nperception and action, and the\nrelationship between observed action\nand one’s own behavior. The overlap in\nbrain regions responsible for these two\nimportant social functions suggests how\ntightly coupled and coordinated social\ninteractions can be. However, these two\nsystems cannot operate in isolation from\nour knowledge of the context in which\nbehavior occurs. We, therefore, turn to\nthis topic next.\n\nThe Social Context\n\nIn a tennis game or any social\ninteraction (e.g., dancing, conversation),\nthe behavior of one individual\nconstitutes a stimulus for others. If a\nbehavior is meaningful, then neural\nmechanisms responsible for social\nperception and social interaction are\nlikely to be activated to engage in\ncomplementary action. In a competitive\ncontext, such as the tennis game, the\nmotor system is engaged in the\npreparation and execution of\ncomplementary actions to those\nobserved and anticipated based on the\ninferred goals and intentions of the\ncompetitor. However, if everyone shares\nthe same goal, for example, as in an\naudience clapping, the neural systems\nfor monitoring the actions of others and\nexecuting one’s own actions can be\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021306",
