The 67-year-old American\nis seen by many as one of the few\nfigures outside the world’s second-\nlargest economy who actually does.\n\nHe is regarded as a knowledgeable\ninsider, having been an adviser to\na number of leading Chinese bod-\nies since the late-1980s and knowing\nmany of the country’s top political\nfigures personally.\n\n“There is rarely alignment between\nwhat topics China’s leaders think are\nimportant about China and what\nthe world thinks,” says Kuhn, also\nan international corporate strate-\ngist and investment banker. “Under-\nstanding China requires knowing the\ndifference.”\n\nHe was speaking recently in the\nfive-star Grand Hyatt hotel in central\nBeijing, which is his home for 90 days\na year. The rest of the time he divides\nbetween his three homes in the Unit-\ned States and traveling elsewhere.\n\n“They treat me very well here.\nEven when I travel around China, I\nkeep a room here,” he says.\n\nThe hotel is well placed near to\nChina’s seat of government around\nTian’anmen Square where he has an\nextensive network of contacts.\n\nHis latest book, How China’s Lead-\ners Think: The Inside Story of China’s\nPast, Current and Future Leaders,\nwhich is now out in paperback and\nmore than 500 pages, goes into\nextensive detail about those who\nhave the responsibility for shaping\nmodern China.\n\nKuhn, who cuts a dapper figure,\nsays many in the West often have an\noutdated view about modern Chi-\nnese leaders.\n\n“The reality is that China’s leaders\nare meritocratic,” he says.\n\n“Many have strong academic back-\ngrounds from top universities and\nall have significant experience, often\nhaving run two or more provinces or\nmajor municipalities as Party secre-\ntary, governor or mayor.”\n\nKuhn, who is also a new China\nDaily columnist, is much in demand\nfrom major news organizations\naround the world, including TV\nappearances on BBC, CNBC, Eurone-\nws and Bloomberg TV, and says he\nhas had complete freedom to express\nhis opinions.\n\n“T have written three books about\nChina, dozens of articles and col-\numns; I’ve produced two major TV\ndocumentaries about China and\ngiven scores of media interviews —\nand never has anyone in China even\nrequested to censor anything I’ve\npublished or broadcast outside of\nChina,” he says.\n\nSome in the West, however, have\naccused him of being too much of an\ninsider and not giving the full picture\nabout China because he was too close\nto the leadership.\n\nRobert Lawrence Kuhn says China's growth is good for the world, but it cannot save the world.\n\n“T deem it vital, considering Chi-\nna’s importance in the world, that\nChina’s leaders become more known\nto the world, and known not just via\nsound-bites and photo ops, but by\nseeing them up-close as real people\n— hearing their own words, listen-\ning to their stories, getting their ways\nof thinking. I’m pleased to facilitate\nsome of this,” he says.\n\n“T also offer my own analysis. As\nfor my accuracy and understand-\ning, readers or viewers can judge for\nthemselves.”\n\nKuhn, who was born in New York,\nbegan his career as a scientist. After\nstudying biology at John Hopkins\nUniversity, he did a doctorate in\nanatomy and brain research at the\nUniversity of California at Los Ange-\nles in the 1960s. Brain science and\nconsciousness remain major inter-\nests of his.\n\nHis first involvement in China was\nthrough the scientific community in\nthe late-1980s when he worked with\nscientists reforming China’s research\nand technology base. He received an\ninvitation from Song Jian, then a\nState councilor and chairman of the\nState Science and Technology Com-\nmission.\n\nAt the time he was developing a\nparallel business career and became\npresident of The Geneva Companies,\na leading US mergers and acquisi-\ntions company, which he eventually\n\nsold to Citigroup in 2000.\n\nAt the same time he was cement-\ning links with leading business and\npolitical figures in China.\n\nHis organization, The Kuhn Foun-\ndation, with CCTV (China Central\nTelevision), produced the documen-\ntary In Search of China for PBS in the\nUS, which was broadcast in 2000.\n\nHe is now working on a new five-\npart series China’s Challenges, which\nwill be broadcast in China in the\nautumn and syndicated to PBS sta-\ntions in the US next year.\n\nPerhaps Kuhn’s most significant\nproject was writing a biography of\nformer president Jiang Zemin, which\nwas the best-selling book in China\nin 2005.\n\nHow China’s Leaders Think was\nbased on interviews with more than\n100 leading Chinese political figures,\nsome of whom he has known for\nmore than a decade.\n\n“I know many personally and have\nworked with several for a number of\nyears. When you hear them speak\nover a period of time, it gives you\na sense of their personalities and\ncharacter as well as their intellec-\ntual capabilities, leadership style and\npolitical progress,” he says.\n\nKuhn sometimes likes to invoke\nhumor to explain why there is some-\ntimes friction between Chinese and\nAmerican leaders.\n\n“Some people think it is because\n\nFENG YONGBIN / CHINA DAILY\n\nof ideological, historical or cultural\nreasons that we have communica-\ntion problems. As I once pointed out,\nperhaps it’s because China’s leaders,\nthe members of the Politburo Stand-\ning Committee, were trained as engi-\nneers, and most American politicians\nwere trained as lawyers. Maybe the\nproblem is that lawyers and engi-\nneers can’t talk to one another!”\n\nKuhn says the main focus in the\nWest is often the Chinese economy\nand whether it will continue to\nmotor ahead.\n\n“China should have 10 to 20 more\nyears of what we should still call rela-\ntively high growth, driven by con-\ntinuing the country’s unprecedented\nurbanization and modernization.\n\n“Growth rates will naturally ease\nfrom reform’s historic averages —\nprobably to 6 to 8 percent per annum\n— which is less than we are used to,\nbut which may be optimal because\nChina can more effectively deal with\nits most severe problems, particu-\nlarly economic and social imbalances\nand sustainable development.\n\n“However, China’s economy is frag-\nile, vulnerable to exogenous shock.\nChina’s growth is good for the world,\nbut it cannot ‘save the world?” he\nsays.\n\nKuhn says there is often a dan-\nger of China being misrepresented\nbecause it is seen through a narrow\nperspective.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023702\n\nROBERT LAWRENCE\nKUHN\n\nInternational corporate strategist,\ninvestment banker, senior adviser\nto multinational corporations and\nauthor\n\nAge: 67\n\nEducation:\n\n* Bachelor's degree in human biology,\nJohns Hopkins University, 1964\n\n* PhD in anatomy and brain research,\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles,\n1968\n\n* Master of sciences in management,\nMIT Sloan School of Management,\n1980\n\nCareer:\n\n+ President and co-owner of The Ge-\nneva Companies, a US leading mergers\nand acquisitions company (sold to\nCitigroup in 2001)\n\n* Chairman, The Kuhn Foundation,\nwhich produces documentaries on\nscientific and philosophical questions\nas well as on China issues\n\n+ Author of The Man Who Changed\nChina: The Life and Legacy of Jiang Ze-\nminand How China's Leaders Think, as\nwell as 25 books on business strategy,\nfinance and investment banking\n\nBooks: The Inflationary Universe: The\nQuest for a New Theory of Cosmic\nOrigins by Alan H.
