DERSHOWITZ\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 2 of 34\nJANE DOE #1 and JANE DOE #2\nv.\nUNITED STATES\n__________________________/\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\nSOUTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA\nCase No. 9:08-80736-Civ-Marra/Johnson\nJANE DOE NO. 1 AND JANE DOE NO. 2’S RESPONSE TO SUPPLEMENT IN\nSUPPORT OF MOTION FOR LMITED INTERVENTION BY ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ\nCOME NOW Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 (the “current victims”), by and through\nundersigned counsel, to file this response to the Supplement to Reply in Support of Motion for\nLimited Intervention by Alan Dershowitz (DE 317-1). Dershowitz claims that an affidavit\nsubmitted by Jane Doe No. 3 in support of an unrelated pleading proves that she is “lying with\nrespect to her claims against [him].” DE 317-1 at 1. The affidavit proves nothing of the sort.\nIndeed, if recent pleadings show anything, it is that Dershowitz continues to hide the truth about\nhis activities.\nBefore turning to the specifics of what Dershowitz argues in his supplement, it is even\nmore important to consider what he fails to argue. In neither his original reply (DE 306) nor his\nrecent supplement (DE 317-1) has Dershowitz provided specific evidence to contest Jane Doe\nNo. 3’s allegations that he sexually molested her. This omission is revealing, because\nDershowitz has repeatedly claimed in the media that he has irrefutable proof that her allegations\nare false. For example, on January 7, 2015, on the Fox Business (Lou Dobbs) program,\nDershowitz stated: “I did the investigation in a day and was able to prove through all kinds of\n1\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 3 of 34\nrecords that I couldn’t have been in these places. The woman is a serial liar. If [Cassell and\nEdwards] had done that investigation, they would have come to the same conclusion.” 1\nSimilarly, on January 8, 2015, on the Greta van Susteren show on FOX, Dershowitz claimed:\n“Now I can prove through documentary evidence that I was never at the times and places she\n[Jane Doe No. 3] alleges she had sex with me.” 2\nYet despite having publicly claimed to have\n“all kinds of records” and “documentary evidence” that “prove” Jane Doe No. 3 is lying,\nDershowitz has yet to produce a single document to this Court. Dershowitz’s intransigence is\nnot limited to this case, as he has also refused to comply with discovery requests in a parallel\ndefamation action in state court. His refusal has led to a pending motion to compel. See\nPlaintiff’s Motion to Compel Production of Documents, Edwards v. Dershowitz, No. CACE 15-\n000072 (Feb. 23, 2015) (attached as Exhibit 1) (“despite having had 45 days to gather materials\nthat allegedly provide ‘absolute proof’ than he has never even met Jane Doe No. 3 – and despite\nhaving told numerous media sources that he had already collected such information –\nDershowitz has provided none of these documents . . . .”). 3\nThe Court should draw the obvious\ninference that Dershowitz, despite making broad claims to the media, has no such evidence to\nproduce – because Jane Doe No. 3’s allegations are true.\n1 http://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3976630676001/alan-dershowitz-the-woman-is-a-serialliar/?\n- sp=show-clips.\n2 http://radio.foxnews.com/2015/01/08/greta-alan-dershowitz-this-time-its-personal/.\n3 Jane Doe No. 3 explained in her earlier response that the Court should not allow\nDershowitz to intervene here because he can protect his (alleged) reputational interests in the\npending defamation action. DE 291 at 11-12). The Court may be interested to learn that\nDershowitz has recently filed a counterclaim against Edwards and Cassell for defaming him in\nthat action – suggesting he can litigate his reputational interests there, and thus has no need to do\nso here.\n2\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 4 of 34\nIn his most recent supplemental filing with this court (DE 317-1), Dershowitz twists the\nfacts and jumps to conclusions in service of his crusade against Jane Doe No. 3. For example,\nDershowitz notes that Jane Doe No. 3 told attorney Edwards before April 2011 that Dershowitz\nhad abused her, but then says “she and Edwards sat on this highly charged accusation for three\nyears and eight months before first using it in their [sic] pleading filed on December 30, 2014.\nThis constitutes laches that prejudiced . . . Dershowitz . . . .” DE 317-1 at 2. Dershowitz ignores\nthe key fact that in April 2011, attorney Edwards did not represent Jane Doe No. 3. Accordingly,\nhe could not “sit” on her claims against Dershowitz because he was not empowered, at that time,\nto pursue them. 4\nWith regard to the claim of laches, Dershowitz argues that he has been prejudiced\nbecause if the allegations had been filed earlier, “he would have been in a far better position to\nsecure travel and other records needed to disprove these charges.” DE 317-1 at 2. But, as noted\nabove, Dershowitz has already told worldwide news media that he has already collected all of the\nrecords and can provide irrefutable, documentary proof that Jane Doe No. 3 is lying. For\nexample, Dershowitz has told the Boston Globe that “he will use his travel and credit card\nrecords, which he said he has fastidiously saved, to refute the allegations against him.” 5\n4 Nor did Jane Doe No. 3 sit on any claims against Dershowitz, notably claims relating to\nthe CVRA case. In 2011, Jane Doe No. 3 lacked legal counsel regarding the CVRA claim. It\nwas not until her recent return from Australia to the United States that she understood the claims\ninvolved in the CVRA action and obtained legal counsel to pursue them. See DE 310-1 at 8, ¶\n57.\n5 “Dershowitz ‘thrilled’ to be sued for defamation,” Boston Globe (Jan. 7, 2015),\navailable at, http://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2015/01/06/sued-for-defamation-dershowitzthrilled-chance-question-lawyers-sex-crime-accuser/21QibSrwNC343eKMadWNeL/story.html.\n3\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 5 of 34\nDershowitz can’t have it both ways – simultaneously claiming he has the records and that he is\nharmed in collecting them – and the Court should not credit his conflicting positions.\nCONCLUSION\nThe Court should deny Dershowitz’s motion to intervene.\nDATED: March 24, 2015\nRespectfully Submitted,\n/s/ Bradley J.

EDWARDS and PAUL G.\nCAS SELL,\nvs.\nPlaintiff(s),\nALAN M. DERSHOWITZ,\nDefendant(s).\nPLAINTIFFS' MOTION TO COMPEL PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS\nPlaintiffs, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G. Cassell, by through their undersigned\nattorneys, move to compel production of documents relevant to this action that defendant Alan\nM. Dershowitz has refused to produce.\nDershowitz has told numerous media sources that he has collected documents that\nprovide \"absolute proof\" that he has not sexually abused a minor woman known as \"Jane Doe\nNo. 3.\" And yet despite having received a valid discovery request for these and other related\ndocuments more than 45 days ago, Dershowitz has refused to produce these documents to\nEdwards and Cassell. Indeed, he has refused to produce any documents to them. Accordingly,\nthe Court should direct Dershowitz to produce these materials forthwith, as well as order him to\npay reasonable costs and attorneys' fees necessitated by his refusal to make any appropriate\ndocument production.\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 9 of 34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nFACTUAL BACKGROUND\nOn December 30, 2014, Jane Doe No. 3 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion)\nseeking to join a case in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, Jane Doe\nNos. 1 and 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736. She was represented by two attorneys who\nspecialize in (among other things) representing crime victims, Bradley J. Edwards and Paul G.\nCassell. The case involved an attempt to rescind a non-prosecution agreement (NPA) barring the\nprosecution of Jeffrey Epstein and his criminal associates on grounds that the victims' rights\nunder the Crime Victims Rights Act (CVRA) had been violated.\nIn her corrected motion, Docket Entry (DE) 280, Jane Doe No. 3 briefly proffered the\ncircumstances that would qualify her as a \"victim\" eligible to assert rights under the CVRA. See\n18 U.S.C. 3771(e) (defining a CVRA \"victim\"). Jane Doe No. 3 briefly explained that when she\nwas a minor, Jeffrey Epstein had trafficked her to Prince Andrew and Alan Dershowitz (among\nothers) for sexual purposes. The motion also provided specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3's\nparticipation was relevant to the case, including the pending discovery issues regarding Prince\nAndrew and Dershowitz. See DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining several reasons participation of new\nvictims was relevant to existing issues).\nAfter the motion was filed, Dershowitz made numerous media statements about the filing\n— and defamatory statements about Edwards and Cassell. For example, on CNN on January 5,\n2015, Dershowitz stated that Edwards and Cassell are \"prepared to lie, cheat, and steal. These\nare unethical lawyers.\"\n2\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 10 of\n34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nhttp://www. cnn.com/videos/world/20 1 5/0 1 /0 5 /wrn-uk-sex-abuse- al legations-alan-dershowitzintv.\ncnn\nIn the course of defaming Edwards and Cassell, Dershowitz also made numerous\nrepresentations that he had collected documents proving that he had never even met Jane Doe\nNo. 3, much less sexually abused her. For example, on the same CNN program on January 5,\nDershowitz stated: \"No, never met her [Jane Doe No. 3], I didn't know what she looked like until\nI saw her photograph. . . . I have a superb memory. I have a memory of not having met her. I\ndid not meet her. And believe me, I remember everybody I've ever had sex with. . . . I can prove\nit by flight records. I can prove it by my travel records.\" Id. (emphasis added). Dershowitz\nwent on to say that disproving Jane Doe No. 3's allegations was a simple task requiring about\none hour of work: \"If they [Edwards and Cassell] had just done an hours' worth of work, they\nwould have seen she is lying through her teeth.\" Id.\nThat same day, on NBC's Today Show, Dershowitz repeated his claim that it was a\nsimple matter to collect documents disproving allegations made by Jane Doe No. 3:\nHer lawyers Paul Cassell, a former Federal judge and Brad Edwards, deliberately\nand willfully filed this pleading which they knew I had no opportunity to respond\nto in court, without doing any investigation, if they had simply investigated the\nmanifests of the airplanes, if they had checked my travel records, if they had\nasked me and I could have given the names of these people who are witnesses,\nthey would know the stories, totally, completely false.\nhttps://www.voutube.com/watch?v—ZXePKTwsOf0\n3\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 11 of\n34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nTwo days later, Dershowitz told Lou Dobbs on Fox Business, that he had already\ncompleted his investigation and had \"all kinds of records\" proving that Jane Doe No. 3 was a\nliar:\nThey [Edwards and Cassell] did it for crass financial and political reasons. More\nto the point is [what] they didn't do... I did the investigation in a day and was able\nto prove through all kinds of records that I couldn't have been in these places.\nThe woman is a serial liar. If they had done that investigation, they would have\ncome to the same conclusion.\nhttp://video.foxbusiness.com/v/3976630676001/alan-dershowitz-the-woman-is-a-serial-liar/?\nsp=show-clips.\nIn response to the CVRA motion that Edwards and Cassell had made for Jane Doe No. 3,\non January 5, 2015, Dershowitz filed a motion to intervene in the case to respond, along with an\naffidavit claiming that he had not sexually abused Jane Doe No. 3. In that affidavit, Dershowitz\nstated that \"[i]f [Edwards and Cassell] had done any reasonable investigation of their client's\nfalse allegations, they would have found absolute proof that I did not [sexually abuse her] ...\neven the most minimal of investigation would have proven conclusively that I could not have\nhad sex with their client on Mr Epstein's island, in New Mexico or on the airplanes; and that I\ndid not have sex with her in his New York or Palm Beach homes.\" DE 282-1 at ¶ 8.\nOn January 6, 2015, plaintiffs Edwards and Cassell filed their complaint in this action,\nalleging a massive public assault on their character by defendant Dershowitz. On January 9,\n2015, Edwards and Cassell filed their Initial Request for Production to Defendant Alan M.\nDershowitz. They requested production of documents along the lines that Dershowitz suggested\nhe had already collected. For example, Request for Production (RFP) No. 9 sought \"[copies of\n4\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 12 of\n34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nany and all 'absolute proof as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn declaration of Alan M.\nDershowitz.\"\nOn February 11, 2015, counsel for Edwards and Cassell sent an email to counsel for\nDershowitz, noting that discovery production was past due and inquiring as to whether a motion\nto compel would be necessary. That same day, a paralegal for Cole, Scott & Kissane confirmed\nthat appropriate production would be made by the end of the week. Shortly after, an attorney for\nDershowitz disavowed that commitment, and indicated that Dershowitz would make his\nproductions by February 23, 2015.\nOn February 23, 2015 — 45 days after the discovery requests had been served —\nDershowitz responded. With regard to the request for production of documents, Dershowitz\nproduced no documents whatsoever. Instead, he made a vague commitment to produce\nunspecified documents at some unspecified time in the future. Illustrative of Dershowitz's\nfailure to make any substantive production is the following request for production and\nDershowitz's answer:\n9. Copies of any and all \"absolute proof' as described in paragraph 8 of\nthe sworn Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz.\nRESPONSE: Defendant objects to this Document Request to the extent\nthat Plaintiffs seek to alter or shift any burdens of proof as a matter of law in this\naction. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific objections and\nGeneral Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce all responsive, nonprivileged\ndocuments currently in his possession, custody or control.\nDershowitz made the same evasive response — \"Defendant responds that he will produce\"\nunspecified \"non-privileged documents\" — to multiple discovery requests. See Dershowitz\n5\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 13 of\n34\nEdwards, Bradley vs. Dershowitz\nCase No.: CACE 15-000072\nPlaintiffs' Motion to Compel Production of Documents\nResponse to Requests for Production 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 13, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22, and 23.\nTo permit the Court to review the extent of Dershowitz's evasions, a copy of his responses is\nattached to this pleading as Exhibit A.\nIn short, despite having had 45 days to gather materials that allegedly provide \"absolute\nproof' that he has never even met Jane Doe No. 3 — and despite having told numerous media\nsources that he had already collected such information — Dershowitz has produced none of these\ndocuments to Edwards and Cassell. He has also made blanket assertions of a variety of\nprivileges, but has produced no privilege logs.\nCONCLUSION\nAccordingly, Edwards and Cassell request:\n1. That Dershowitz be directed to produce all materials covered by the discovery\nrequests forthwith;\n2. That Dershowitz be held to have waived any and all otherwise applicable privileges as\na consequence of his failure to timely file a privilege log; and\n3. That Dershowitz be ordered to pay reasonable costs and attorneys' fees associated\nwith the need to file this motion to compel.\nCERTIFICATE OF GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO RESOLVE\nPlaintiffs have attempted in good faith to resolve the discovery issues presented in this\nmotion (and others) as evidenced by the letter attached as Exhibit B.

Dershowitz.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request as overly broad because Jane Doe #3 alleges in the\nfiling titled \"Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4's Motion Pursuant to Rule 21 For Joinder In Action\"\n(Doc. No. 279) (the \"Joinder Motion\") in the civil action captioned Jane Doe #1, et al. v. United\nStates, Case No. 08-80736 (S.D. Fla.) (the \"Federal Action\") that she was \"kept as [Jeffrey\nEpstein's] sex slave from about 1999 through 2002.\" Jane Doe #3 further alleges in the Joinder\nMotion that she \"escape[d]\" from Mr. Epstein and moved to Australia in 2002. Paragraph 5 of\nthe sworn Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz refers to plane travel by members of Mr. Epstein's\nlegal team after 2002 and therefore Defendant further objects because this Document Request\ndoes not seek documents relevant to this action or documents reasonably calculated to lead to the\ndiscovery of admissible evidence.\n8. Copies of any and all flight manifests reflecting your presence or the presence of any\nmember of your family on any aircraft on which Jeffrey Epstein was also a passenger during the\nsame flight.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant responds that he has no responsive, non-privileged documents.\n9.

Dershowitz.\n5\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 21 of\n34\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request to the extent that Plaintiffs seek to alter or shift any\nburdens of proof as a matter of law in this action. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing\nspecific objections and General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce all\nresponsive, non-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.\n10. Copies of any and all documents supporting the allegation that \"Jane Doe #3 is a serial\nliar\" as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz.\nRESPONSE:\nSubject to and without waiving the General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce\nall responsive, non-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.\n11. Copies of any and all documents tending to establish that President Clinton has never\nvisited Jeffrey Epstein's island, Little Saint James, as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn\nDeclaration of Alan M. Dershowitz.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request because it misstates paragraph 8 of the sworn\nDeclaration of Alan M. Dershowitz, which expressly states that \"on information and belief I\nhave been advised that Secret Service records would confirm that President Clinton has never set\nfoot on that island.\" (Emphasis added). Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific\nobjections and the General Objections, Defendant responds that he has no responsive, nonprivileged\ndocuments.\n6\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 22 of\n34\n12. Copies of any and all documents evidencing that Jane Doe #3 \"has also told lies about\nmany world leaders\" as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn Declaration of Alan M.\nDershowitz.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request because it misstates paragraph 8 of the sworn\nDeclaration of Alan M. Dershowitz, which expressly states that \"on information and belief [Jane\nDoe #3] has also told lies about many world leaders.\" (Emphasis added). Defendant further\nobjects to this Document Request because it seeks documents already in Plaintiffs' possession\nand/or that are publicly available. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific\nobjections and the General Objections, Defendant responds by reference to statements by Jane\nDoe #3 reflected in the media, which are equally available to Plaintiffs.\n13. Copies of any and all documents evidencing that \"the State Attorney in Palm Beach\nCounty dropped a case that she sought to bring based on an assessment by the investigating\ndetective regarding the 'victim's lack of credibility'\" including a copy of the letter reflecting this\ndecision as described in paragraph 8 of the sworn Declaration of Alan M. Dershowitz.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request because it misstates paragraph 8 of the sworn\nDeclaration of Alan M. Dershowitz, which expressly states that \"on information and belief the\nState Attorney in Palm Beach County dropped a case that she sought to bring based on an\nassessment by the investigating detective regarding the 'victim's lack of credibility.' A copy of\nthe letter reflecting this decision was forwarded to central records.\" (Emphasis added). Subject\nto and without waiving the foregoing specific objections and the General Objections, Defendant\nresponds that he will produce all responsive, non-privileged documents currently in his\npossession, custody or control.\n7\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 23 of\n34\n14. Copies of any and all documents evidencing that the attorneys for the Jane Does acted \"in\nbad faith in an effort to have the media report it as described in paragraph 9 of the sworn\nDeclaration of Alan M.

Copies of any and all documents reflecting that Jane Doe #3 has charged President Bill\nClinton with having sex with her on Jeffrey Epstein's Little Saint James Island.\nRESPONSE:\nSubject to and without waiving the General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce\nall responsive, non-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.\n16. Copies of any and all documents reflecting that Jane Doe #3 has alleged that President\nBill Clinton had sex or engaged in any inappropriate contact with her on the Island owned by\nJeffrey Epstein.\nRESPONSE:\nSubject to and without waiving the General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce\nall responsive, non-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.\n17. Copies of all pages of Passports held by you at any time during the past 12 years.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request as seeking sensitive personal information and\ndocuments that are not relevant to the subject matter of the pending action.\n8\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 24 of\n34\n18. Copies of any and all documents reflecting that Jane Doe #3 has ever willfully engaged in\nprostitution.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request as vague because Defendant is not in a position to\ndetermine the willful nature of Jane Doe #3's prostitution. Defendant further objects to this\nDocument Request because Jane Doe #3 has repeatedly and publicly asserted that she gave her\nbody for sexual activity for hire after the age of 18 and agreed to secure other persons for the\npurpose of prostitution or for any other lewd or indecent act and therefore the Document Request\nis unduly burdensome.\n19. Copies of any and all documents reflecting that Jane Doe #3 is either a liar or has\nperjured herself in any way.\nRESPONSE:\nSubject to and without waiving the General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce\nall responsive, non-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.\n20.

Copies of any and all documents tending to support your assertion that Paul G. Cassell:\na. has a reputation of being sleazy;\nb. has acted in a sleazy manner;\nc. has engaged in unethical conduct;\nd. has knowingly relied upon false statements in any legal document filed by him;\ne. has engaged in any form of unethical conduct;\nf. has engaged in any form of conduct tending to demonstrate a lack of fitness to engage\nin the practice of law;\ng. has engaged in any form of conduct warranting the loss of his license to practice law or\nthe imposition of any professional disciplinary action against him;\nh. has acted in a corrupt manner;\ni. failed to conduct any investigation of the allegations of Jane Doe #3 relating to you\nbefore referring to those allegations in a legal filing.\nRESPONSE:\nSubject to and without waiving the General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce\nall responsive, non-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.\n10\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 26 of\n34\n22.

Therefore Defendant objects to this Document Request to the extent that it\npurports to seek documents relating to any time before 1999 or after 2002. Defendant further\nobjects to this Document Request as overly broad and premature because Jane Doe #3 has not\nspecified the dates on which she alleges Defendant engaged in misconduct on Mr. Epstein's\nplane, which are the sole relevant allegations by Jane Doe #3 or her counsel concerning travel on\nMr. Epstein's plane that Defendant refutes and asserts are false. Subject to and without waiving\nthe General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce all responsive, non-privileged\ndocuments currently in his possession, custody or control relating to any occasions that may be\nspecifically identified by Jane Doe #3 on which she contends that Defendant travelled on Jeffrey\nEpstein's plane between 1999 and 2002.\n23. Copies of any and all records, including emails and text messages, between you and\nJeffrey Epstein between December 29, 2014 and today, regarding allegations made by Jane Doe\n#3 of sexual misconduct by either of you.\nRESPONSE:\nDefendant objects to this Document Request to the extent that it seeks documents regarding\nallegations made by Jane Doe #3 of sexual misconduct by Jeffrey Epstein because such\ndocuments are not relevant to the subject matter of this action and would be attorney-client\nprivileged communications in any event. Subject to and without waiving the foregoing specific\n11\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 27 of\n34\nobjections and the General Objections, Defendant responds that he will produce any responsive,\nnon-privileged documents currently in his possession, custody or control.\nRespectfully submitted,\nOf Counsel.•\nAshley E.

When this occurs, even if responsive information is\nforthcoming, we have no guarantee that you have not unilaterally withheld information\nsubject to the stated objections or claims of privilege; in other words, it shields the very\nexistence of responsive matters from discovery without any ability to assess the merits\nof the objection or claim of privilege as applied to the ostensibly protected matters. A\nfederal court described the problem:\nThis Court has on several occasions \"disapproved [of] the practice of\nasserting a general objection 'to the extent' it may apply to particular\nrequests for discovery.\" This Court has characterized these types of\nobjections as \"worthless for anything beyond delay of the discovery.\" Such\nobjections are considered mere \"hypothetical or contingent possibilities,\"\nwhere the objecting party makes '\"no meaningful effort to show the\napplication of any such theoretical objection' to any request for discovery.\"\nc-reac\nEXHIBIT B\n111■\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 30 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 2\nThus, this Court has deemed such \"ostensible\" objections waived or [has]\ndeclined to consider them as objections.\nSonnino v. Univ. of Kan. Hosp. Auth., 221 F.R.D. 661, 666-67 (D. Kan. 2004) (citations\nomitted).\nOf course, where claims of privilege are involved, the response must include a privilege\nlog enabling us (and the court, if necessary) to assess the applicability of the privilege\nclaimed. See Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(b)(5). Under Florida law, \"the burden is upon the\nparty asserting a privilege to establish the existence of each element of the privilege in\nquestion.\" Fla. Sheriff's Self-Ins. Fund v. Escambia County, 585 So.2d 461, 463 (Fla. 1'1\nDCA 1991).\nGeneral or blanket objections are inappropriate in and of themselves: \"A 'blanket'\nobjection to interrogatories consisting of many, separate questions is insufficient.\nObjections in such a case should be addressed 'to a particular interrogatory or class of\ninterrogatories, not to the interrogatories in general.\" Twadell v. Twadell, 199 So. 2d\n501 (Fla. 4th DCA 1967) (quoting Carson v. City of Ft. Lauderdale, 173 So.2d 743 (Fla.\n2d DCA 1965)).\nThe same principles apply to the general objections you have raised to our production\nrequests.\nBoilerplate Objections\nA boilerplate objection such as \"overbroad, burdensome, and not reasonably calculated\nto lead to the discovery of admissible evidence,\" baldly asserted, is \"patently without\nmerit.\" Such \"stonewalling tactics\" constitute discovery abuse. First Healthcare Corp.\nv. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1193 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999); see also First City Devs. Of\nFla., Inc. v. Hallmark of Holly Condo. Ass in, 545 So.2d 502, 503 (Fla. 41h DCA 1985)\n(noting that conclusory objections such as \"burdensome\" and \"not reasonably calculated\n...\" are \"words of the art [that] have little meaning without substantive support, ..\").\nEvery burdensome objection you have raised is required to be supported by an affidavit\ndetailing the extent of the burden claimed to preclude a substantive response.\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 31 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 3\nAsserting Privilege for Non-Existent Documents\nIt is inappropriate to assert a claim of privilege or immunity for non-existent materials.\nGreenleaf v. Amerada Hess Corp., 626 So.2d 263, 264 n.1 (Fla. 4th DCA 1993). We\nmust assume that the privilege is asserted for a reason, i.e., that responsive and\nostensibly privileged information in fact exists, else the privilege would not have been\nasserted. It follows that a privilege log must accompany all such responses.\nClaiming Undue Burden for Non-Existent Materials\nLikewise, objecting on basis of burdensomeness and later conceding an opponent's right\nto materials or later claiming materials do not exist constitute abusive discovery\npractices. First Healthcare Corp. v. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1194 (Fla. 4th DCA\n1999).\nCustody, Possession & Control\nFla. R. Civ. P. reaches all documents (broadly defined and specifically including\nelectronic data) in your client's \"custody, possession, or control.\" Custody and\npossession are self-explanatory. \"Control\" is broader; it \"means the legal right to obtain,\neven from nonparties. The concept of 'control' generally has been held to mean the legal\nright to obtain the requested documents. Parties thus can be requested to produce\ndocuments in the hands of their attorney, insurer, subsidiary, or another person outside\nthe jurisdiction of the court.\" Lawrence M. Watson, Jr. & Michael S. Orfinger, Fla.\nCivil Practice Before Trial , 16.60 (1993 ed) (citing 8 Wright & Miller, Fed. Practice\n& Procedure £16-10 (1998 ed.). A recent federal court case construing Fed. R. Civ. P.\n41 (on which Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.350 is patterned), explained:\nThe term \"control\" comprehends not only possession but also the right,\nauthority, or ability to obtain the documents. Accordingly, Rule 34(a)\nallows a party seeking discovery to require production of documents\nbeyond the actual possession of the opposing party if such party has\nretained \"any right or ability to influence the person in whose possession\nthe documents lie.\" [A] party is deemed to have control over documents\nheld on its behalf by its attorneys. A party is also deemed to have control\nover financial records of the party that are in the possession of the party's\naccountant.\nMGP Ingredients, Inc. v. Mars, Inc., 2007 WL 3353401 (D. Kan. 2007) (citation\nomitted); see also In Re Ski Train Fire of November 11, 2000 Kaprun Austria, 2006\nsiSistas,\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 32 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 4\nWL 1328259, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2006) (\"Courts have long construed the term 'control' as\nmeaning more than simple 'possession.' Control has been construed broadly by the\ncourts as the legal right, authority, or practical ability to obtain the materials sought\nupon demand.'\"). See also Frantz v. Golebiewski, 407 So.2d 283, 285 n.4 (Fla. 3 DCA\n1981) (\"Interpretations of the federal rule are persuasive in considering its Florida\nequivalent.\").\nWhile your responses purport to recognize the obligation to produce documents subject\nto Mr. Dershowitz's \"contra', there are qualifications in the responses that would\nappear to contradict that recognition. Your objection to the production of metadata has\nno legal foundation.\nWord Play and Gamesmanship\nYou will note that we do not include page after page of definitions. I believe that any\nlawyer reasonably fluent in English can carry out his or her duty to construe\ninterrogatories and requests for production in the broad and liberal manner intended by\nthe rules. Florida courts frown on parsing and gamesmanship. See, e.g. First Healthcare\nCorp. v. Hamilton, 740 So.2d 1189, 1194 (Fla. 4th DCA 1999) (chastising counsel who\ndid not turn over \"event\" reports because plaintiff requested \"incident\" reports as\nengaged in \"little more than a semantic shell game.\").\nRepeated assertions that statements were made by Mr. Dershowitz \"upon information\nand belief' is an example of prohibited \"word play.\" That qualification has no bearing\non the Defendant's discovery obligations.\n\"Will Produce\"\nThe Rules of Civil Procedure require production and not just a commitment of\nproduction at some unspecified future date. If the documents you intend to produce are\navailable for inspection and copying now as they are required to be, we are prepared to\npick them up immediately. If they are not immediately available, when will they be?\nTimeframe Objections\nYour repeated attempts to restrict discovery to a narrow timeframe, fail to account for\nthe fact that this is a defamation action arising out of broad defamatory statements made\nby Mr. Dershowitz impugning the honesty and integrity of the Plaintiffs without any\nlimitations as to a specific time or circumstance. Mr. Dershowitz has also made broad\npublic denials of misconduct unrestricted to any specific timeframe. We are entitled to\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 33 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 5\ntest the accuracy of those statements and to explore the full extent of the personal\nrelationship he has had with Jeffrey Epstein.\nEvasive Answers\nThe response to Interrogatory #2 is a typical example of an evasive response. Rather\nthan address the substance of the questions posed, the Defendant engages in a four page\ndiatribe about the alleged impropriety of naming him in a CVRA filing on behalf of\nJane Doe #3. If that is the only improper conduct in which the Defendant contends\nBradley Edwards has engaged, then the Defendant is obliged to say so.\nInterrogatory #3 asks for the specific content of statements and the names of every\nwitness to the making of the statements. We get a vague reference to \"such comments\"\nand references to the inability to \"recall all of the people.\" Not a single witness' name\nis disclosed. If the Defendant is unable to identify a single person he is obliged to\nunequivocally say so.\nRefusing to Provide Substantive Responses Until Jane Doe #3 is Deposed\nThis objection has absolutely no legal basis and fails to recognize that this is a\ndefamation action against Dershowitz and not Mr. Dershowitz's defamation action\nagainst Jane Doe #3. This action is absolutely not dependent on the accuracy of the\nstatements made by Jane Doe #3, although the Plaintiffs were and are confident of the\naccuracy of those statements.\nObjecting Because You Think We Already Know the Answers\nSee for example the Response to Interrogatory #13. There is no legal basis for refusing\nto provide information because the Defendant believes the Plaintiff already knows the\nanswer or has alternative sources to ascertain some or all of the information requested.\nAn admission from an opposing party carries legal significance that other evidence does\nnot have. We are entitled to Dershowitz's sworn responses regardless of what flight\nlogs purport to show.\nIncomplete Answers\nSee, for example, Interrogatory #15. A question that asks for names, addresses, and\ntelephone numbers, is not properly responded to if all we get is, \"Thomas and Joanne\nAshe, as well as Defendant's wife and daughter.\"\nCase 9:08-cv-80736-KAM Document 319-1 Entered on FLSD Docket 03/24/2015 Page 34 of\n34\nThomas E. Scott, Jr., Esq.\nRe: Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz\nFebruary 25, 2015\nPage 6\nand we will file an appropriate motion to compel. I would like to focus on substantive\ndisagreements, obtain quick and fair rulings on them, and move on.\n/JACK SCAROLA\n/mep\ncc: Bradley Edwards, Esq.\nPaul G. Cassell, Esq.",
