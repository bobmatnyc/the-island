  "text": "26 Teaching Minds\n\nI most certainly taught the lessons this writer describes. I hated it\nwhen students couldn’t get to the point and I frequently interrupted\nthem when they were speaking. In business, I make a point of saying\nthings that are very simple, which tends to upset people. I find this a\ngood way to start a conversation that addresses complex issues.\n\nOf course, I never actually say any of this. I simply do it. The real\nissue in teaching, by parents or by teachers or by anyone else, is the\nmodel you present to the students. That model is presented by what\nthey see you do and how they see you act. They can choose to emulate\nyou or not. But a good teacher makes students think about how to\nbehave and about what works and what doesn’t.\n\n| believe that effective teaching makes .. .\n\nstudents think about how the teacher is behaving and causes\nthe students to wonder about whether copying this behavior\nwould be a good idea\n\nstudents think about what works and what doesn’t in the adult\nworld\n\nThis next writer is a professor at a major university. I hired him to be\non the faculty at Yale, which was his first academic job.\n\nI teach by telling stories that are meaningful to me. I let them\nsee who I am and how I live. I let them see what is important\nto me and why. To be a real teacher you have to let yourself be\nvulnerable. The student needs to see that you are a human with\nfeelings and fears and goals. You are saying to students: This is\nthe way I do it; it fits with who I am; it helps me be successful;\nand don’t let anyone tell you that you can’t do something.\nEveryone wants to control you, but in the end, you have to be\nyou, for better or worse. So, don’t let anyone tell you that you\ncan’t do something.\n\nI tell that story over and over and over again in different\nways. About my research, about my company, about my family. I\nwalk the talk.\n\nAnd, the students have to see that there are consequences\nof breaking the rules; that it costs; and the costs can be high\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_023772",
