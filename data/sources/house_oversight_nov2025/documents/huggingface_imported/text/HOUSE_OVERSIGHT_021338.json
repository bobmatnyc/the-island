The possession of empathic\ncapacity is not sufficient to determine\nthe precise nature of the response toward\nothers, however. As Decety points out,\nwhether an individual attends to and\nresponds empathically upon observing\nemotion in another individual depends\non, among other things, dispositional\ntendencies, the relationship between the\nindividuals, and contextual constraints.\nMotivation to help another is also\ninfluenced by the amount of cognitive\neffort we are willing and able to exert to\ntake the perspective of the other.\n\nPerspective-taking is essentially\nan attempt to see into the invisible mind\nof another. What we can’t see, we model\nbased on our own mind and like-minded\nindividuals. Nick Epley shows that\nseeing into and connecting with other\nminds is such a frequent operation of the\nsocial brain that the absence of others\ninclines people to see human minds in\nnonhuman entities. Whether it’s a tree, a\npet, or God, ascribing mind to others\nendows them with the capacity to\nexperience the same affective states we\nexperience. This shared capacity evokes\nin us a tendency to feel and express\nempathic concern for their well-being.\nUnfortunately, humans do not grant all\nindividuals, much less non-human\nentities, an equivalent degree of mind.\nEpley articulates how differences in the\ncapacity to see mind in others have\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021338",
