  "text": "The City of San Francisco was sued for $4.3 million by a man who\nhad been a peaceful observer at the riot following the verdict. He was\nwalking away from the Civic Center area when a cop yelled, “We’ re\ngonna kill all you faggots!” --and beat him on the head with his\nnightstick. He was awarded $125,000.\n\n| had wanted to sue the city, but an attorney requested $75 for a\nfiling fee, and | didn’ t have it. | was too foolish not to borrow it, and |\n\ndecided to forego the lawsuit. | must’ ve been crazy.\n\n3. In 1985, after living in San Francisco for sixteen years, | moved to a\nwalk street in Venice, a block-and-a-half walk to the beach. | rented a top-\nfloor tiny two-room apartment consisting of a kitchen/office where | could\nsee the ocean and a living-room/bedroom which came with a convertible\nsofa. The bathroom had a bathtub/shower.\n\nOne afternoon, | took a bus to Santa Monica to eat at a little soul-\nfood restaurant in a food court and to see a Woody Allen movie. When |\nreturned home, | walked up the steps to the top floor, and when | opened\nthe door to my “penthouse” apartment, it was filled with smoke. | had\nstupidly, utterly recklessly, left a candle burning in a glass ashtray on the\n\narm of the sofa. | didn’ t forgetto do that. | chose to leave it that way.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015447",
