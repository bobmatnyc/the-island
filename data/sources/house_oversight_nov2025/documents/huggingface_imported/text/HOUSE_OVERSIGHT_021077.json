It has been\ndescribed as \"a middle ground\" between\nfee-for-service reimbursement (in which\nproviders are paid for each service rendered\nto a patient) and capitation (in which\nproviders are paid a \"lump sum\" per patient\nregardless of how many services the patient\nreceives).\n\nBusiness Cycle - Fluctuations in overall\nbusiness activity accompanied by swings in\nthe unemployment rate, interest rates, and\ncorporate profits. Over a business cycle, real\n(inflation-adjusted) activity rises to a peak\n(its highest level during the cycle) and then\nfalls until it reaches a trough (its lowest level\nfollowing the peak), whereupon it starts to\nrise again, defining a new cycle. Business\ncycles are irregular, varying in frequency,\nmagnitude, and duration. (NBER) See real\nand unemployment rate.\n\nCash Accounting - A system of accounting\nin which revenues are recorded when they\nare actually received and outlays are\nrecorded when payment is made.
