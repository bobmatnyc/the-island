  "text": "individuals that make up societies. On\nthis view, the social level of organization\narises out of the interaction of lower-\nlevel entities. But invisible forces\noperate in both directions; one’s degree\nof social integration or isolation (at the\nhigher level) can have profound\ninfluence on one’s mental and physical\nhealth (at the lower level). Just how\nthese forces operate—in both\ndirections—is one of the main themes of\nthis book.\n\nA recurring theme is the human\nneed for connection. As we have\nexplored this fundamental need, it has\nbecome clear that it can be satisfied in\npart by connections not necessarily to\nother human persons, but to other minds.\nSince the minds of others are in part of\nour own construction, connections to a\nhigher being, or to our pets, or even to a\ntranscendent order underlying the world,\ncan fulfill part of what we strive to\nattain. Indeed, such non-human\nattachments can share the character of\nhuman connection: we can feel valued\nby our pet (just as we can feel validated\nin a social relationship), we can have an\nintimate dyadic relationship with God\n(just as we can be intimate with a close\nfriend), and we can feel a sense of\nbelonging to the universe (just as we can\nfeel that we belong to social group).\nThis explains how different, even\ncontradictory, notions of a relationship\nto God, for instance, can lead different\npeople each to find meaning in such a\nrelationship: finding God on the\ndowntown bus versus encountering God\nin the purposeful unfolding of the natural\norder.\n\nThe ideas of symmetry,\ncomplementarity, coordination, and co-\nregulation also run through several of\nour essays. Regulation of biological\nsystems is often maintained through\n\n150\n\nPage\n\npaired systems of biological checks and\nbalances; when one system is activated,\nthe other tends to restore equilibrium.\nFor instance, one set of muscles flexes\nthe arm, and an opposing set extends it.\nWe have seen that the sympathetic and\nparasympathetic components of the\nautonomic nervous system—the system\nthat makes us breathe and that makes our\nheart pump—operate in this way, and\nthat chronic stimulation of some\nsystems, like overstretched elastic bands,\nlose their ability to spring back. The\nnotions of observing a behavior and\nperforming that behavior not only are\nconceptually similar, they may be rooted\nin a common set of neurological\nstructures which may, in turn, help us to\nunderstand how we can perceive another\nhuman being as being /ike us, but not us.\nAnthropomorphism is the belief that\nother minds mirror our own; this colors\nthe way we perceive the world and the\nother actors in it, a mechanism that\nallows us to simulate getting under the\nskin of the other person.\n\nHappiness and loneliness are\nperceptions about our place in the world\nthat profoundly affect our physical\nbodies and our social relationships.\nReligious beliefs, too, can have profound\neffects on health and physical well-\nbeing, working through the same\nbiological mechanisms that in health\nmaintain equilibrium.\n\nUnseen, yet powerful, forces\nregulate social behavior. Empathy, for\ninstance, contributes to the regulation of\nsocial interactions. Synchronous\nbehavior points to a phenomenon that\nmakes the individual feel subsumed by\nthe group, feeling part of a larger,\norganic whole. These behaviors can be\nas disparate as “the wave” at a sports\nstadium or congregational prayer at a\nchurch service. Shared feelings of\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021396",
