  "text": "This should be built around the common\nchallenges of radical Islamist terror, border\nsecurity, missile defense... and of course, Iran.\n\nAnd being led by the United States, it could\nprovide a variety of synergies for all its regional\nparticipants.\n\nSecondly, we need a daring peace initiative vis-\na-vis the Palestinians.\n\nA two-state solution is the only viable long-\nterm solution.\n\nIt is a compelling imperative for us, in order to\nsecure our identity and our future as a Jewish\nand democratic state; it’s not a favor for the\nPalestinians...\n\nBelieve me, I tried hard as Prime Minister,\ntogether with President Clinton. So | know,\nfrom personal experience, that the Palestinians\nare not easy partners for peace.\n\nPrime Minister Netanyahu has taken\ncourageous steps, to renew the process\nincluding an unprecedented settlement freeze.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_027017",
