  "text": "Key financial market driver 2 - US economic outlook\n\nKey questions\n\ne Is the nascent growth recovery sustainable? Will the Fed stimulus boost growth?\n\ne How will the election result change fiscal policy deliberations?\n\n® Can politicians find an agreement to avoid a sharp fiscal contraction in early 2013 (i.e. the \"fiscal cliff\")?\n\nCIO View (Probability: 70%*) Moderate expansion\n¢ The economy stays on a moderate growth path but the unemployment rate comes down only very gradually - the\nSeptember report exaggerated the pace of improvement. Core personal consumption expenditure (PCE) inflation stays\nslightly below or close to the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. UBS forecasts real GDP growth of 2.0% in 3Q 2012\n(consensus: 1.8%) and 1.6% in 4Q 2012 (consensus: 1.9%). The Fed has added considerable stimulus: it extended\nOperation Twist and its interest rate forward guidance, indicated that it will stay highly accommodative even after the\nrecovery strengthens, launched an open-ended agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) purchase program of USD\n40bn per month, and shows a strong easing bias tied to the state of the labor market. The Fed actions effectively\nmitigate downside growth risks, but they are unlikely to dramatically boost growth.\n\n¢ In the elections, Republicans will likely lose seats in the House on a net basis but retain a majority; we expect them\nto be even with Democrats in the Senate. Obama will likely retain the White House. Such an electoral outcome would\nprolong the existing gridlock between Republicans and Democrats.\n\n¢ Due to the ongoing political gridlock, we expect modest fiscal tightening. The government will likely let\nunemployment benefits phase out and payroll tax cuts expire, but postpone income tax hikes and sequester spending\ncuts. Such a decision would lower the federal deficit by 0.7% of GDP, with a likely lower real GDP growth impact as\nhouseholds could buffer the income loss with lower savings.\n\nA Positive scenario (Probability: 10%*) Strong expansion\n¢ Propelled by expansive monetary policy and a fading Eurozone crisis, growth accelerates persistently above 3.0%.\nThis leads to higher inflation and the Fed responds by halting QE3 and raising rates sooner.\n\n¢ The better economic outlook raises the odds of an Obama reelection and makes it harder for Republicans to gain\nseats in Congress. Faster-rising tax collection and a Democratic stronghold leads to some tax hikes and limited\nspending cuts. Fiscal policy tightens by about 1.2% of GDP in 2013.\n\n& Negative scenario (Probability: 20%*) Growth recession\n¢ US fiscal deleveraging and an escalating Eurozone crisis weigh on the cyclical recovery. Falling profit margins weigh\non business capital expenditures. Real GDP growth deteriorates much further. The Fed massively purchases agency\nMBS and Treasuries under its QE3 program.\n\n¢ The debt limit is reached earlier and the Treasury runs out of money before year-end. Political gridlock becomes\ndysfunctional, thus sending the country over the \"fiscal cliff,\" with fiscal policy tightening by\n\nUSD 607 billion (3.7% of UBS estimate of 2013 GDP) in 2013.
