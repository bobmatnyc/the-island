The fact that\nmany churches, as well as conservative and reform Judaism, support equality has muted the\nimpact of the religious right somewhat on this issue. Before long, I predict, it will not be an issue\nfor most Americans.\n\nIn 2003, during the beginning of the presidential election season, the Supreme Judicial Court of\nMassachusetts rendered the first-in-the-nation decision declaring it unconstitutional to limit\nmarriage to heterosexual couples. This decision was truly a knife that cut both ways: it was a\nMagna Carta for gay and lesbian couples, but it was also a boon to social conservative candidates\nwho could use it as an important part of their appeal to the majority of Americans who then\nbelieved that marriage should be reserved for heterosexual couples.\n\nI decided to write an op ed that would seek to eliminate gay marriage as “a wedge issue” in the\nupcoming political campaign. In it, I argued that if marriage is indeed sacreda divine, a blessed\nsacrament between man and woman as ordained in the Bible, it would follow that the entire\nconcept of marriage has no place in our civil society, which recognizes the separation between the\nsacred and the secular, between church and state. Just as the state has no role in baptisms,\ncircumcisions or other religious rituals, it should play no role in sacred marriages.\n\nThe state is, of course, concerned with the secular rights and responsibilities that are currently\nassociated with the sacrament of marriage (as it is with the safety of baptisms and circumcisions):\nthe financial consequences of divorce, the custody of children, Social Security and hospital\nbenefits, etc.\n\nThe solution I proposed is to unlink the religious institution of marriage -- as distinguished from\nthe secular institution of civil union -- from the state. Under this proposal, any couple, regardless\nof gender, could register for civil union, recognized by the state, with all its rights and\nresponsibilities.\n\nReligious couples could then go to the church, synagogue, mosque or other sacred institution of\ntheir choice in order to be married. These religious institutions would have total decision-making\nauthority over which marriages to recognize. Catholic churches would not have to perform or\nrecognize gay marriages. Orthodox Jewish synagogues would not perform or recognize a\nmarriage between a Jew and a non-Jew who did not wish to convert to Judaism. And those\nreligious institutions that chose to perform or recognize gay marriages could do so. It would be\nentirely a religious decision beyond the scope of the state.\n\nUnder this new arrangement, marriage would remain a sacrament, as ordained by the Bible and as\ninterpreted by each individual church. No secular consequences would flow from marriage, only\nfrom civil union.\n\nIn this way, gay couples would win exactly the same civil rights as heterosexual couples in\nrelationship to the state. They would still have to persuade individual churches of their point of\nview, but that is not the concern of the secular state.\n\nNot only would this solution be good for gays and for those who oppose gay marriage on\nreligious grounds, it would also strengthen the wall of separation between church and state by\n\n311\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017398",
