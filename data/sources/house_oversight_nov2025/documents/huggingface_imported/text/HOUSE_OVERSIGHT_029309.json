AGI thresholds are also used in taxing\ninvestment-type income:\n\na Net Capital Gains are taxed at the 20\npercent maximum rate at levels beyond\nwhich income would otherwise be\n\npushed into the 39.6 percent bracket\n\n(for 2013, that applicable threshold\namount is $450,000 AGI for married\nindividuals filing joint returns and sur-\nviving spouses, $425,000 for heads of\nhouseholds, $400,000 for single indi-\nviduals, and $225,000 for married in-\ndividuals filing separate returns. (The\n“regular” 15 percent capital gains rate\nis likewise reduced to zero percent for\ntaxpayers in the 10 percent bracket—\na benefit that can be used by same-sex\ncouples where one partner has very\nlittle income).\n\na Net Investment Income, as defined un-\nder new Code Section 1411, is taxed\nstarting in 2013 at 3.8 percent, keyed\nto a modified AGI threshold based on\nfiling status ($250,000 for joint filers;\n$125,000 for married, filing separately;\nand $200,000 for all others).\n\nDeduction!Credit Thresholds.

Jn dealing with threshold\namounts, a benefits/drawbacks analysis gen-\nerally depends upon the extent to which that\nportion of any tax benefit below a thresh-\nold amount would otherwise go unused by\none of the partners if filing separately. With\ncertain deductions, credits or contribution\nlevels, however, electing “married filing sep-\narately” status may relegate each spouse to\n$0 benefit depending upon circumstances.\n\nOTHER SAME-SEX COUPLE\nINCOME TAX ISSUES\n\nBeing married for federal tax purposes—ex-\nclusive of the right to any particular filing\n\nstatus—can also give rise to additional tax\nbenefits and restrictions. The following sit-\nuations may be particularly relevant in the\ncase of married same-sex couples after the\nSupreme Court’s Windsor decision:\n\nDependency Exemptions. \\n 2012, the\nIRS explained on its website that if a child\nis a qualifying child under Code Sec. 152(c)\nand both parents are same-sex partners,\neither parent, but not both, may claim a\ndependency deduction for the qualifying\nchild if separate returns are filed. If both\nparents can otherwise claim a dependency\ndeduction for the child on their income tax\nreturns, the IRS will treat the child as the\nqualifying child of the parent with whom\n\n“Same-sex couples may\nfind that the benefits of\n\nfiling a joint return may\nnot always be greater than\nfiling separately...”\n\nthe child resides for the longer period of\ntime. If the child resides with each parent\nfor the same amount of time during the tax\nyear, the IRS will treat the child as the quali-\nfying child of the parent with the higher ad-\n\njusted gross income.\n\nCCH Tax Briefing\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029309",
