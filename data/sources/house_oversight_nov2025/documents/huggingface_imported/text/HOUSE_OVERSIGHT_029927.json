The King wasn’t buying it,\nhowever, and he asked a commission of\nthe French Academy of Sciences to\nlook into the claims. (The members in-\ncluded Franklin, the chemist Antoine\nLavoisier, and Joseph Guillotin—who\ninvented the device that would eventu-\nally separate the King’s head from his\nbody.) The commission replicated some\nof Mesmer’s sessions, and, in one case,\nasked a young boy to hug magnetized\ntrees that were presumed to contain the\nhealing powers invoked by Mesmer. He\ndid as directed and responded as ex-\npected: he shook, convulsed, and\nswooned. The trees, though, were not\nmagnetic, and Mesmer was denounced\nas a fraud. Placebos and lies were inter-\ntwined in the public mind.\n\nIt was another hundred and fifty years\nbefore scientists began to focus on the\nrole that emotions can play in healing.\nDuring the Second World War, Lieu-\ntenant Colonel Henry Beecher—who\nwent on to become the first chairman of\nthe anesthesia department at Massachu-\nsetts General Hospital—attempted to\nassess the degree to which the severity\nof a soldier's injuries corresponded to\nthe amount of pain he felt. In Europe,\nBeecher met with more than two hun-\ndred soldiers, gravely wounded but still\ncoherent enough to talk; he asked each\nman if he wanted morphine. Seventy-\nfive per cent declined.\n\nBeecher was astounded. He knew\nfrom his experience before the war that\ncivilians with similar injuries would have\nbegged for morphine, and he had seen\nhealthy soldiers complain loudly about\nthe pain associated with minor inconve-\nniences, like receiving vaccinations. He\nconcluded that the difference had to do\nwith expectations; a soldier who survived\na terrible attack often had a positive out-\nlook simply because he was still alive.\nBeecher made a simple but powerful ob-\nservation: our expectations can have a\nprofound impact on how we heal.\n\nArmed with this information, and\nwith his conviction that the placebo\neffect could be harnessed to help relieve\nsuffering, Beecher returned to the United\nStates and continued his research. In\n\n1955, he published an article called “The\n\n32 THE NEW YORKER, DECEMBER 12, 2011\n\nPowerful Placebo,” in which he wrote\nthat “placebos have a high degree of ther-\napeutic effectiveness in treating subjec-\ntive responses.” The paper has been cited\nmore than a thousand times by other sci-\nentists, and Beecher’s conclusion—that\nthe placebo effect plays a critical role\nin almost any medical intervention—\ninfluenced much of what has followed in\nclinical research. His basic supposition\nwas correct: emotions and expectations\ncan affect our perception of pain.\n\nBefore Beecher’s work, new drugs\nwere tested in a haphazard manner; since\nthen, they have always been compared\nwith a placebo or with another drug. But\nBeecher’s methodology was deeply\nflawed. Although he reported that place-\nbos were effective more than a third of\nthe time, he shrugged off a phenomenon\nknown as “regression to the mean.” Over\ntime, the condition of most patients\nimproves, with or without treatment.\nA person who enrolls in a clinical study\nwhen he is feeling particularly bad is\nlikely to improve solely as a result of the\nnatural course of the illness, not because\nhe was given a placebo. (And people\noften enroll in such studies when they are\nsickest.) A patient who knows that he is\nin a study also may expect a better thera-\npeutic result than one who doesn’t. Ifyou\nbelieve that doctors are particularly atten-\ntive, you can get better more rapidly, even\nif they aren't. This is known as the Haw-\nthorne effect. (There is also a “nocebo\neffect.” Expecting a placebo to do harm\nor cause pain makes people sicker, not\nbetter. When subjects in one notable\nstudy were told that headaches are a side\neffect of lumbar puncture, the number of\nheadaches they reported after the study\nwas finished increased sharply.)\n\nFor years, researchers could do little\nbut guess at the complex biology of the\nplacebo response. A meaningful picture\nbegan to emerge only in the nineteen-\nseventies, with the discovery of endor-\nphins: substances secreted in the brain\nthat are chemically similar to opiates like\nmorphine and heroin. The discovery led\nto the novel idea that, in effect, the brain\nproduces its own pharmacy. In 1978,\nthree scientists from the University of\nCalifornia at San Francisco—Jon Levine,\nNewton Gordon, and Howard Fields—\ndecided to investigate whether endor-\nphins might explain why patients who\nreceived placebos often reported a\n\nsignificant reduction in pain. People re-\ncovering from dental surgery were told\nthat they were about to receive a dose of\nmorphine, saline, or a drug that might\nincrease their pain. By then, researchers\nhad learned not only about the nocebo\neffect but that a suggestion of relief will\noften trigger the production of endor-\nphins, so they were not surprised that pa-\ntients receiving saline reported reduced\npain.\n\nWhat came next, however, funda-\nmentally reshaped the field. The re-\nsearchers dismissed the subjects who re-\nceived morphine and then divided the\nremaining participants into those who\nresponded to the placebo and those who\ndidn’t. Then they introduced Naloxone\ninto patients’ 1.V. drips. Naloxone was\ndeveloped to counteract overdoses of\nheroin and morphine. It works essen-\ntially by latching onto, and thus locking\nup, key opioid receptors in the central\nnervous system. The endorphins that we\nsecrete attach themselves to the same re-\nceptors in the same way, so Naloxone\nblocks them, too. The researchers theo-\nrized that, if endorphins had caused the\nplacebo effect, Naloxone would negate\ntheir impact, and it did. The Naloxone\ncaused those who responded positively to\nthe placebos to experience a sharp in-\ncrease in pain; the drug had no effect on\nthe people who did not respond to the\nplacebo. The study was the first to pro-\nvide solid evidence that the chemistry be-\nhind the placebo effect could be under-\nstood—and altered.\n\n“Tt was one of those studies that make\nthe scales fall from your eyes,” Kaptchuk\ntold me. “T had just started to think about\nthe placebo eftect—scientifically and his-\ntorically. And here comes this paper that\nsays that, even if it’s all in your head, there\nis still a biological mechanism driving\nthese reactions. It was very exciting.”\n\naptchuk assumed that the results\n\nwould add legitimacy to the field.\nHe was wrong. “Things are better than\nthey were,” he said. “But even now, you\nknow, people at Harvard talk about pla-\ncebos the way the Popes used to talk\nabout medicine. They declared that Jews\nwere not allowed to treat Christians—\nnot because they were not good doctors\nbut because it would have been ethically\nwrong. These are ethical judgments mas-\nquerading as science. Because from the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029927",
