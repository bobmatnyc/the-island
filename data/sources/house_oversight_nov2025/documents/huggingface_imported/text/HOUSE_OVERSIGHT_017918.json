  "text": "In re Terrorist Attacks on September 11, 2001, 392 F.Supp.2d 539 (2005)\n\n10 A.L.R. Fed. 2d 789\n\nemployees are civil servants, it is an organ of the\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia. See Filler, 378 F.3d at 217.\nFurther, the Court finds SHC has not waived its sovereign\nimmunity. The representations to the contrary on which\nPlaintiffs rely were made before this lawsuit was\ncontemplated and cannot be read as a waiver of immunity\nfrom this court’s jurisdiction. The Second Circuit has\nmade clear that the waiver of FSIA immunity must be\nexplicit. See Banco de Seguros del Estado v. Mutual\nMarine Office, Inc., 344 F.3d 255, 261 (2d Cir.2003)\n(requiring wavier that unambiguously waives claims of\nimmunity from legal proceedings in this country). Finally,\nPlaintiffs have not identified a factual dispute that would\nrequire jurisdictional discovery. See Filetech S.A. v.\nFrance Telecom S.A., 304 F.3d 180, 183 (2d Cir.2002)\n(finding no abuse of discretion where district court\nresolved jurisdictional issue without holding evidentiary\nhearing because factual disputes were “readily\nascertainable” from the record). Accordingly, Plaintiffs\nmust demonstrate that an exception under the FSIA\napplies to their claims against SHC. See Virtual\nCountries, 300 F.3d at 241.\n\n2. Prince Salman and Prince Naif\n\n(1 Aside from allegations regarding personal contributions\nto charities that were fronts for terrorists, the Plaintiffs’\nclaims against Prince Salman and Prince Naif concern\ntheir official functions. The allegations against Prince\nSalman, for example, center on his role as President of\nSHC, (see, e.g., Ashton Compl. J 457; Burnett Compl. J\n406; Federal Compl. J 456) or as Governor of Riyadh,\n(see Ashton Compl. § 291; Burnett Compl. § 402).\nSimilarly, the allegations against Prince Naif center on his\nrole as Minister of Interior of the Kingdom. (See Ashton\nCompl. J 286; Burnett Compl. J 382; Federal Compl. J\n435.) To the extent the allegations concern actions\nundertaken in their government positions, the Court finds\nthat Prince Salman and Prince Naif are foreign states for\nFSIA purposes. See Leutwyler, 184 F.Supp.2d at 286-87\n(recognizing that “individuals employed by a foreign\nstate’s agencies or instrumentalities are deemed ‘foreign\nstates’ when they are sued for actions undertaken within\nthe scope of their official capacities”). Thus, Plaintiffs\nmust also show that an FSIA exception applies to Princes\nSalman and Naif. Virtual Countries, 300 F.3d at 241.\n\nC. Application of FSIA Torts Exception\nWESTLAW\n\nPlaintiffs claim any immunity enjoyed by SHC, Prince\nSalman, and Prince Naif is overcome by the FSIA’s torts\nexception. The Federal Plaintiffs also argue that the\ncommercial activities exception should lift *554 the\nsovereigns’ immunity. For the reasons explained in its\nprevious opinion, the Court concludes that the torts\nexception is the only exception relevant to the allegations\ncontained in the Ashton, Burnett, and Federal complaints\nagainst SHC, Prince Salman, and Prince Naif. See\nTerrorist Attacks [, 349 F.Supp.2d at 793-94 (explaining\nthat the Federal Plaintiffs’ reliance on the commercial\nactivities exception is inappropriate because the alleged\nacts by Defendants were not the type of actions “by which\na private party engages in trade and traffic or commerce,”\nand explaining the state sponsor of terrorism exception\napplies only to designated state sponsors of terror, of\nwhich the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is not).\n\n(1 1 The torts exception lifts immunity for “personal\ninjury or death, or damage to or loss of property,\noccurring in the United States and caused by the tortious\nact or omission of that foreign state or any official ... of\nthat foreign state while acting in the scope of his office.”\n28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5). For jurisdiction to be proper\nunder the torts exception, Plaintiffs will have to show,\nfirst, that the Defendants’ tortious acts caused Plaintiffs’\ninjuries. Robinson v. Gov't of Malaysia, 269 F.3d 133,\n142 (2d Cir.2001) (“If those activities could not render the\nMalaysian government liable for a tort under New York\nlaw, then it remained immune under § 1605(a)(5).”).\nSecond, Plaintiffs must show that Defendants’ actions\nwere not discretionary, ie., not grounded in the social,\neconomic, or political policies of the Kingdom of Saudi\nArabia. Terrorist Attacks [. 349 F.Supp.2d at 794-97; see\nalso 28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(5)(A) (providing that the torts\nexception is not applicable to “any claim based upon the\nexercise or performance or the failure to exercise or\nperform a discretionary function regardless of whether the\ndiscretion be abused’). “Under the FSIA’s ‘discretionary\nfunction’ exception, ‘acts which are performed at the\nplanning level of government, as opposed to those at the\noperational level, are protected by the immunity.’ ”\nMarchisella v. Gov't of Japan, No. 02 Civ. 10023(DC),\n2004 WL 307248, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Feb.17, 2004) (quoting\nNapolitano vy. Tishman Constr. Corp., No. 96 Civ.\n4402(SJ), 1998 WL 102789, at *4 (E.D.N.Y. Feb.26,\n1998)).\n\nHere, since SHC, Prince Salman, and Prince Naif are not\nalleged to have been the actual perpetrators of the attacks,\nPlaintiffs rely on theories of conspiracy and aiding and\nabetting.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017918",
