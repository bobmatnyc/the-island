We estimate that the 2017 U.S. state-legal cannabis market was $8.0\nbillion, with more than four million consumers. While the overall state-legal market has grown sig-\nnificantly, the addressable market has been constrained due to the lack of access to purely recreational\nconsumers and the sometimes-narrow scope of medical conditions that qualify a patient for access to\n\nmedical cannabis. The breakdown of this market estimate by state is shown in the following chart.\n\n2017 U.S. State-Legal Cannabis Market Estimate\n\nOther States\n$1.9B\n\nCalifornia\n$3.2B\n\nColorado\n$1.5B\nOregon Washington\n$470M $929M\nSource: Ackrell Capital\nU.S. Federal Law\n\nCurrent federal law effectively prohibits all cannabis use and all commercial cannabis activity in the\nUnited States. Producing, selling and possessing cannabis are federal crimes. No cannabis-derived drug\nhas ever been federally approved for use in treating any medical condition. Otherwise legitimate busi-\nness transactions conducted by cannabis companies—and their banks, for those who can access bank-\ning services—are legally suspect. Certain intellectual property and bankruptcy protections critical to\nmany U.S. businesses are not available to cannabis companies. Cannabis companies pay federal income\ntax at effective rates significantly higher than other businesses.\n\nDespite official prohibition, however, federal policies and laws recently passed by Congress have\ncarved out a limited space in which the state-legal cannabis industry has managed to thrive. Enforce-\nment policies published by the U.S. Department of Justice have unofficially invited cannabis business\nto proceed if certain conditions are respected. The U.S. Department of the Treasury established report-\ning policies that create room for banks to service the cannabis industry.
