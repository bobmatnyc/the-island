I’m flexible after Tuesday. (Doing CNBC on Trump-China Tues morning)

I forgot to congratulate you on winning your loooooong-odds bet on Trump with Woody. Everyone I know,
including me, would have bet against you. Quite extraordinary.

Dear Jeffrey:

Attached, as promised, is our proposal for Closer To Truth to produce the definitive television series on “The
Science of Sleep and Dreams” - 13 episodes, a full season, on ~200 PBS stations, plus extensive web videos.
Contemporary advances in sleep/dream research makes timing propitious.

Three documents:

1) Proposal (12 pages)

2) Budget (line item)

3) Schedule (weekly)

Please confirm receipt.

I'll be in New York from January 19 until about February 8. Love to meet - on Sleep/Dreams and all sorts of
fun stuff to cheer our 2017.
