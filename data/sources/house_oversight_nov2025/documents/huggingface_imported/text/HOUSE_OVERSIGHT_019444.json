The meeting was pretty much what you would \nexpect until its conclusion, when the congress declared: \"As a matter of urgency, \nfacilities for controlled, ecosystem-scale experiments are required now.\" With-\nout a better toolbox to study how the natural world responds to global climate \nchange, \"sustained human habitability of Earth\" would be at risk. \nFortunately, just such a toolbox was already being designed by Norman \nWiner, a Canadian biochemist and plant biologist. Htiner had begun work on his Biotron Institute for \nExperimental Climate Change Research in 1999. In early 2008 it will open its doors, the first facility in the \n• \nAtebtionsumm,..iii* \nper capita water consumption in the United States: 660,430 gallons. In China: 184,920 gallons \nWINTER 2008 \nPeace in \nThe Garden \nLAST FALL IN THE GERMAN \ncity of Kassel.. a group of \nabout 15 women harvested \na bumper crop of pumpkins, \nsquash, and wine grapes \nfrom a small community gar-\nden. Nothing unusual there, \nperhaps—except that the \nwomen were from Morocco, \nAfghanistan, Somalia, and \nthe former Yugoslavia. \nThe \"intercultural garden\" \nin Kassel is one of about 100 \nin Germany, but the only one \nrun entirely by women. (And \nafter the gardeners had long \ndiscussions about the haz-\nards of pesticides, its produce \nwill be totally organic.) The \ngardens began in 1495, after \na group of Bosnian women \nin Gottingen, waiting out the \nBalkan conflict, told social \nworkers how much they \nmissed the famous plum and \napple orchards of Bosnia's \nDrina Valley. \nThere has been adversity \nalong the way. A garden in \nBerlin had to be placed under \npolice protection after it was \ntargeted by neo-Nazi protest-\ners. In Cologne the gates of \nanother garden have been \ndestroyed three times. And it \nisn't always easy to coax tra-\nditional crops such as Afghan \nmint, coriander, and Iranian \nleeks from the mineral-rich \nGerman soil. Yet the gardens \nthrive. Says Behoumi, a \n31-year-old from Morocco, \n\"Without the beauty of the \ngarden I could not survive.\" \n—ANGELA BOSKOVICH \nWINTER 2008 onearth 13 \n\fFRONTLINES \nworld that will allow researchers \nto re-create and study how a com-\nplete ecosystem, such as Arctic \ntundra or boreal forest, responds \nto climate change. The Biotron, \nHiiner says, is \"as close as you \ncan get to nature [in a lab].\" \nThe Biotron will help integrate \nbiology into the scientific study of \nglobal warming. Existing climate \nchange models, says Hillier, are \nmore about physics than biology; \nmoreover, they describe changes \nthat are happening to the planet \nrather than to particular habitats, \nspecies, or individuals. Scientists \nhaven't been able to create pre-\ndictive models, for example, \nof how changes in rainfall and \nresearchers tested in two sepa-\nrate \"missions\" whether humans \ncould live sustainably in a sealed, \nself-contained environment as \na precursor to colonizing outer \nspace. The Biotron, scientifically \nspeaking, is in a different league. \nThe superlaboratory is a \njoint project of the University of \nWestern Ontario, the University \nof Guelph, Ontario, and Agricul-\nture and Agri-Food Canada, a \nfederal agency. The nondescript \nfive-story building, located in the \nagricultural heartland of south-\nwestern Ontario, is an engineer-\ning marvel, yet a bargain at just \nU.S. $28 million. \nInside are state-of-the-art fa-\ncilities that support research into \nmicroorganisms, insects, and \nplants, all of which can be geneti-\ncally modified to suit research-\ners' needs. Temperature in the \nResearchers will vie for access to \nthe Biotron much as physicists compete \nto use the world's few particle _ \naccelerators or astronomers the latest and \nbiggest optical telescopes \ntemperature will affect soybean \nyields in the U.S. grain belt or \nbutterflies in the Amazon basin, \nbecause, with a few exceptions, \nthey haven't had the tools to \nmeasure the impact of climate \nchange on living organisms. \nNow there's a place where \nwhole ecosystems can be scrupu-\nlously re-created and organisms \nscrutinized, from their DNA to \ntheir interaction with other organ-\nisms. With more complete data, \nscientists will be able to make \nbetter predictions—and (heir ex-\nperimental findings could better \ninform policy makers, who might, \nfor example, provide subsidies for \ncrops that respond well to emerg-\ning climate patterns. \nThe Biotron may call to mind \nBiosphere 2, the large artificial \nhabitat plopped down 20 years \nago in the Arizona desert, where \nBiotron's climate chambers can \nbe varied from —40 degrees Fahr-\nenheit to 122 degrees, to simulate \nanything from the Arctic winter to \na tropical rainforest On the roof of \nthe building are six \"biomes\"—air-\nlocked, greenhouse-like structures \nthat have been custom designed \nto precisely control environmental \nfactors such as temperature, UV \nradiation, light intensity, wind, pre-\ncipitation, and CO2. Each biome is \nlarge enough to house bees more \nthan 30 feet tall and to allow for \nthere-creation of complex biologi-\ncal communities that can extend \nfrom the highest tree canopies to \nunderground soil layers. \nIf the possibilities seem end-\nless, they nearly are. The plan is \nfor the world's leading scientists to \nrotate in and out of the lab space, \nand the biomes will be regularly \nreconfigured. One such setup will \nuse cross sections of Arctic perma-\nfrost, transported from northern \nCanada, so researchers can study \nhow it reacts to rising tempera-\ntures: As the permafrost thaws, \nhow much methane gas will be \nreleased? How will bacteria and \noverwintering insects be affected \nby changing freeze-thaw cycles? \nScientists will design and study \nmore temperate ecosystems, \nas well, to learn how changes \nin temperature and CO2 affect \nthe growth of photosynthetic \norganisms, including crops and \nboreal forest, \nBiotron researchers will also be \nable to study the benefits and risks \nof biotechnology in agriculture, \nforestry, and medicine by examin-\ning the basic biology of genetically \nmodified organisms: What is the \nrate of gene transfer from trans-\ngenic plants to wild ones? Can \nplants be engineered to manufac-\nture medicinal compounds that \nwill benefit humans? \nThe Biotron will be equipped \nwith a sophisticated imaging and \nanalysis system—a virtual control \nroom—that will expand its reach \nglobally, allowing researchers \nanywhere to manage and moni-\ntor experiments remotely over \nthe Internet in real time. A scien.-\nfist in India studying the impact \nof climate change on rice could \ninstruct the Biotron to raise the \ntemperature or CO2 concentra-\ntion in a biome set up to simulate \na SouthAsian rice paddy. Then he \nor she could monitor the impact \nof this change through images \nand other data automatically col-\nlected and stored in a supercom-\npuling network \nResearchers will vie for access \nto the Biotron in much the same \nway that physicists compete to \nuse the world's few particle accel-\nerators or astronomers the latest \nand biggest optical telescopes. \nlike them, itis a. place for frontier \nscience, where old models will fall \nand new and unexpected ones will \narise—except that the goal is not \nto understand our cosmic origins \nbut to influence our destiny. \nThrough personal care products, the average American child is exposed to 27 chemicals daily that have not been proven safe \nFar From \nNirvana \nNEW YORK CITY'S AMITABHA \nBuddhists are full of good \nintentions. Last summer \nmembers of the group bought \nhundreds of eeLs, frogs, anti \nturtles from the city's China-\ntown markets and released \nthem into New Jersey's Pas-\nsaic River to save them from \nthe dinner table. The problem: \nthe state's Department of \nEnvironmental Protection has \nstrict rules for the release of \nanimals into its watersheds, \nand the group now faces fines \nfor illegally introducing inva-\nsive species. To make matters \nworse, the animals may not \nsurvive, —ADAM SPANGLER \nThey Didn't \nMean That \nIN OUR FALL 2007 ISSUE, \nHoward Frumkin of the \nCenters for Disease Control \nwarned that global warming \nwas \"perhaps the largest \nlooming public health chal-\nlenge that we face.\" On \nOctober 23, Frumkin's \nboss, CDC director Julie \nGerberding, testified about \nclimate change to the Sen-\nate Environment and Public \nWorks Committee.
