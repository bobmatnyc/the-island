Hemp\nstalk fiber was traditionally used as a textile for use in rope; clothing; and sails due to its\ntensile strength. Hemp seeds are used in foods and compressed to make oils that were\nused as a lighting fuel. The original diesel engine was designed to run on a variety of\nbiodiesel fuels, including vegetable oils and seed oils, which included hempseed oil. In\n1937, hemp production was banned due to its similarity to marijuana despite low THC\npresence, but to aid the war effort the federal government requested that farmers plant\nindustrial hemp to make up for a shortfall in imports from the Asian Pacific. Farmers\nplanted 36,000 acres of hemp in 1942 and set a target of 50,000 acres in order to\nproduce the 34,000 feet of hemp that was needed in each Naval battleship and for\nother textile uses. The cheap availability of petroleum based synthetic products and\nfederal regulations against hemp production caused hemp production to decline rapidly\nagain after the war in the U.S. and throughout most of Europe. As hemp now looks to\nmake a comeback in light of recent legislation, we see the use cases for industrial hemp\nto include many of the traditional textile and food uses that were previously common, in\naddition to the growing CBD market.\n\nFigure 133 - Industrial Hemp Imports In 2017 ($1,000) Figure 134 - Industrial Hemp Imports In 2017 (Metric Tons)\nTrue Hemp, True Hemp Yarn True Hemp Woven True Hemp, True Hemp Yarn\nraw/proc. not $2,739 Fabrics raw/proc. not 34\nspun $1,819 spun\n$780 N Hemp Seed 621 «\nOilcake and Solids 7\nHemp Seed 1,475\nOilcake and Solids f\n$11,494\nHemp Oil and\nFractions\n749\nHemp Oil and\nFractions\n$7,603 Hemp Seeds\n\n$42,897 Hemp Seeds\n\n7,606\n\nSource: Cowen and Company, Compiled by CRS using data from the U.S. ITC\n\nSustainability Of CBD And Hemp Production\n\nAs the CBD industry grows in size, we believe that producers will look to minimize the\nenvironmental impact of production. In addition, we could see producers try to monetize\nthe entire waste stream of the hemp production process by converting parts of the\nplant that aren’t used to produce CBD or other products into biomass energy. We\nbelieve the most common use cases for hemp biomass will be in the form of pelleting for\n\n94 COWEN.COM\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024910",
