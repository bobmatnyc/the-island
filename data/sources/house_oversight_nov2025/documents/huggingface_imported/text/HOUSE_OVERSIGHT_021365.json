  "text": "Belief and Connection\n\nWe tend to think of beliefs as\nwisps of the mind that have no power in\nthe material world. However, as Gary\nBerntson and Louise Hawkley have\ndiscussed, beliefs can affect our health\neven to the extent of determining life\nand death. As Tanya Luhrmann\ndiscusses, in some forms of Christianity,\nthere is a real belief in the presence of\nGod. This is not simply a belief of God\nin the world, but a belief of a God who is\nby one’s side. The idea of God as a\nfriend and companion clearly motivates\nthe desire to make such a presence\nmanifest in tangible ways. For some, it is\nthe sense of God with which they\ncommune, for others it is what they\nbelieve to be a sensory experience of\nGod that they seek. Luhrmann outlines\nhow this belief, coupled with a\nsupportive social structure, can lead to\npowerful personal experiences, such as\nhearing the voice of God, reflecting the\noperation of our social brains.\n\nOur sense of social connection is\nnot dependent on a single set of religious\nbeliefs, however. In human social\nconnections, we can form individual\nrelationships with a spouse or friends\nbut, as John Cacioppo outlined, there are\nother kinds of connections that our social\nbrain seeks, as well. We seek\nconnections with emergent structures\nsuch as groups, clubs, teams,\ncongregations, and beyond. Kathryn\nTanner argues that the belief that God\ncreated the world and bears causal\nresponsibility for it serves to connect\nbelievers to life in a broader way than is\nprovided through individual\nrelationships. This broader connection to\nlife does not depend on the manifestation\nof a presence to whom we can talk\nbecause the evidence of social\n\nPage |119\n\nconnection is apparent in the very fabric\nof daily existence. Thus, whereas\nLuhrmann discusses God as a palpable\nfriend that one can learn to attend to and\nexperience as an active presence in one’s\nlife, Tanner discusses God as the\ninitiator of life and the very fabric of\nexistence, a presence so ubiquitous that\nthere is no specific point on which one\ncan focus to attend to or experience God.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021365",
