In addition to these drivers, we view gold as an \nappealing diversifier in light of elevated geopolitical risks. \nHowever, a comprehensive trade deal between the U.S. \nand China would likely constitute a more significant \nheadwind for the yellow metal. \nFind out more in this edition of Capital Market Outlook, \nand feel free to contact us with any questions you have \nabout our market views. \nSincerely, \nPaul \nThis material was prepared by the Chief Investment Office (CIO) and is not a publication of BofA Merrill \nLynch Global Research.
