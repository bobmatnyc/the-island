Bibi, Yitzhik Mordechai and I were all invited, as the three main\ncandidates. But I told the TV people I had a conflicting personal engagement. I\nfigured I had nothing to gain by going. To join a three-way debate risked creating\nthe impression this was a genuine three-man race, and I still held out hope it would\ncome down to just me and Bibi. Besides, I thought a debate between the other two\nwould help me. Yitzhik knew Bibi well. He had served in Bibi’s government.\nThough not a natural orator, he was always forthright, and often pugnacious, in\nmaking his points. And he couldn’t stand Bibi.\n\nUnlike the 1996 debate, this time there was a knock-out blow, and Bibi was the\none left on the canvas. It was a bit like Senator Lloyd Bentsen’s killer riposte when\nRepublic vice-presidential candidate Dan Quayle compared himself to John F.\nKennedy in their debate, a few months earlier: “Jack Kennedy was a friend of\nmine. Senator, you’re no Jack Kennedy...” Bibi entered his television showdown\nwith Yitzhik Mordechai with much the same strategy he’d used against Peres. He\nwent on the offensive. He tried to portray himself as an indispensable bulwark\nagainst those, like Yitzhik or me, who he said would cosy up to Arafat and Assad\nand endanger Israel’s security. But Yitzhik was up for the fight. He also knew that\nonly months earlier, Bibi himself had been exploring the idea of giving up the\nGolan Heights to the same President Assad. He didn’t actually refer to the secret\nmission by Ronald Lauder, or explicitly accuse Bibi of hypocrisy. But his reply —\nand Bibi’s visible discomfort — were just as effective. Smiling sardonically, he\nsaid: “I know your outbursts, and they won’t do you any good.” He challenged\nBibi to just “look me in the eye” and admit what he really thought about the future\nof the Golan. The media verdict was unanimous. Mordechai had won. Which\nmeant I had won.\n\nThough my American and British brains’ trust had little input into our day-to-\nday campaign, they did play a role in the thrust and strategy. I tried to drive home\ntwo things as we entered the two-week homestretch in May. My first, broad\nmessage was an echo of James Carville’s central theme in the Clinton Presidential\ncampaign: “change, versus more of the same.” It had worked in the US not because\nit was clever, but because it resonated with large numbers of voters. I sensed from\nthe start of the campaign that it was true of Israel as well. Different groups had\ndifferent gripes, and different ideas of what they hoped I would provide as Prime\n\n314\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011785",
