  "text": "/ BARAK / 135\n\nYet especially with my main points of contact in the administration — first Bob\nGates and then his successor, Leon Panetta, as Secretary of Defense —our broadly\nshared views, mutual respect, and the strength of the US-Israeli alliance\noutweighed any of that. Neither they, nor indeed President Obama, wavered from\ntheir commitment to the principle that Israel needed to retain our “qualitative\nmilitary advantage” over any combination of threats we might face, nor to the $3\nbillion package of annual US aid that underpinned it. We were even able to agree\non additional US backing for our increasingly effective range of anti-missile\nsystems: the Arrow, against long-range ballistic missiles, developed in\ncoordination with the US defense contractor Raytheon; “David’s Sling,” to target\nenemy forces’ mid-range missiles, cruise missiles and aircraft; and our new Iron\nDome system, integrating sophisticated Israeli radar and guidance technology and\ndesigned to deal with the missile threat from Hizbollah on our northern border and\nHamas in Gaza. It had not yet been used in battle. But from test firings, we were\nconfident it could destroy incoming rockets with nearly 90-per-cent success.\n\nBy late 2011, the issue of Iran had taken on much greater urgency. There was\nstill no sign the American-led diplomatic efforts were succeeding in removing the\nnuclear threat. As for an American military strike, though the President\nintermittently declared that “all options” remained on the table, I knew from senior\nadministration members that it was extremely unlikely to happen. Iran, meanwhile,\nhad been acquiring thousands more centrifuges, more uranium, and heavier\nprotection around its key sites. And the “window of vulnerability” was now only\nabout a year away.\n\nOperationally and politically, at least now a majority of the key players in Israel\nagreed that we had to be prepared to take military action if there was no alternative\nway to rein in the Iranians. Ashkenazi’s successor as chief-of-staff, Benny Gantz,\nhad signed off on the attack plan. While the Iranians were getting ever closer to\nnuclear-weapons capability, the strike force that we were assembling was also\nbetter equipped, trained and prepared to mount a complex, yet almost certainly\nsuccessful, operation. The damage to Iran’s nuclear ambitions would be\nconsiderably less than if we had acted earlier. But our intelligence analysts still\nestimated we could set back the Iranians’ program by about two years.\n\nThe immediate problem turned out to be timing. A major joint military exercise\nwith the Americans, agreed on two years earlier, was due to take place in Israel in\nApril 2012. It would include Patriot missile batteries, naval vessels, and thousands\n\n421\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011892",
