While building the appropriately qualified\nworkforce takes time, Saudi Arabia has been making progress in this area. c25% of\nSaudi tertiary graduates complete humanities and arts programs, but this is down from\n39.4% in 1999. Graduates from social sciences, business and law represented the\nlargest share of graduates at 27.2% of total in 2014, up from 15.5% in 1999. Still, as we\ndiscuss in later sections, diversification prospects are mixed across sectors and will\nlikely depend in part on providing the appropriate incentives to the private sector.\n\nChart 7: Distribution of Saudi tertiary graduates by field of study (%)\n\n40\n\n35 m1999 = 2014\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10\n\n5\n\n0\nwn <= > o o Oo wn wn\n5 S $2 2 sf 8s = S 8\n3 8 ae 2 —£5 o 3 s Pa\ni= = QD ws a BS = aS) [e) oO\nOo no} on Oo = (ep)\nn lu na o ce ZS i>)\n® =a ae Ss =\n= BG os\nFe os wi Ss\no ge & =\n§ =\nx=\n\nSource: UNESCO, BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research\n\nMobilizing domestic resources is key\n\nThe NTP makes clear that part of the NTP costs (40%) will need to be shouldered by the\nprivate sector. Out of a total estimated NTP cost of SAR447bn (USS119bn; 18.4% of\nGDP), the NTP implies that the private sector will need to contribute about SAR179bn\nover the coming five years (US$47.6bn; 7.4% of GDP). Implementation of growth-\nboosting initiatives will require a challenging crowding in of private sector investment.\nThe NTP expects only a SAR40bn increase in the level of Foreign Direct Investment\n(FDI), meaning that the bulk of private sector investment could have to come from\ndomestic sources. While the government investment is generally in retrenchment mode,\nthe NTP may be suggesting that selective and strategic projects are likely to go ahead.\nAuthorities have also suggested a number of projects could be structured as Public-\nPrivate Partnerships (PPP).\n\nOS Merrill Lynch\n\nGEMs Paper #26 | 30 June 2016 15\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016125",
