  "text": "helping them to navigate the ambitions of their wealth. They’ve satisfied\ntheir business dreams. Now there are the separate challenges and\npossibilities of their actual wealth. If they had big dreams before, it’s\nnothing to what they can have now.\n\nIn essence, as Epstein becomes more of a public figure the response to\nthis description of his livelihood, is, in the media and in high social circles,\n“bullshit.” True, there is no clear alternate narrative. No one is accusing him\nof anything, accept, sometimes, guilt by association. (In addition to Robert\nMaxwell, who will be accused of fraud, there’s Steven Hoffenberg, briefly a\nNew York high flyer, who went to jail for a Ponzi scheme, for whom\nEpstein acted as a consultant—along with, he points out, Paul Volcker.) But\nthe characterization persist: if it’s not clear, 1t must be murky. Sure,\nGoldman Sachs partners and tech geniuses, they might have stratospheric\nwealth, but what to make of a Coney Island, Zelig-like no-namer?\n\nIn 1994, just at the moment when Prince Charles is on television\nacknowledging his love for Camilla Parker Bowles, Jeffrey Epstein is sitting\nwith his arm around Princess Diana at a dinner at the Serpentine Galley in\nLondon (Diana is wearing her “revenge” dress that evening). Graydon\nCarter, into his second years as editor of Vanity Fair, is also at the dinner.\nEpstein’s rise and Carter’s rise are not, with a little critical interpretation,\nthat different. Both are a function of the age of new money, both are helped\nby strategic relationships with the exceptionally wealthy (1.e. they are social\nclimbers), both men have made themselves up. To say that Epstein, in the\ncompany of the Princess, sticks in Carter’s craw would be a big\nunderstatement. Epstein becomes one of the “what do you know about him”\nfigures in Carter’s gossip trail—a story waiting to happen. A variety of the\ngossip that begins to circulate about Epstein—for instance, that he secretly\nfilms his guests—is seeded by Carter, who once advised me not to go to\nEpstein’s house or accept a ride in his car least I risk being blackmail. (“For\nwhat?” I asked Carter. “You can’t even begin to imagine,” said Carter.)\n\nEpstein is playing a cat and mouse game with his own growing wealth\nand influence. He is private and secretive, but grandly so. He joins the board\nof Rockefeller University. He’s suddenly on the Trilateral commission, that\ncabal of business people who fancy themselves, and who are fancied by\nconspiracy buffs, as running the world. He buys from his client Limited\nFounder Les Wexner the larges private house in Manhattan. (Rumors will\ncontinue for many years, that Wexner owns the house and Epstein is just\nsquatting in it—an 18-year squat.) He buys an airplane. He buys another. He\nexpands his holdings in New Mexico. He begins a Zanadu refurbishment of\nhis Caribbean Island.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022758",
