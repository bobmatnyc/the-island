When it\ncomes to compliance, there is no one-size-fits-all program.\nThus, the discussion below is meant to provide insight into\nthe aspects of compliance programs that DOJ and SEC\nassess, recognizing that companies may consider a variety\nof factors when making their own determination of what\nis appropriate for their specific business needs.>’° Indeed,\nsmall- and medium-size enterprises likely will have different\ncompliance programs from large multi-national corpora-\ntions, a fact DOJ and SEC take into account when evaluat-\ning companies’ compliance programs.\n\nCompliance programs that employ a “check-the-box”\napproach may be inefficient and, more importantly, ineffec-\ntive. Because each compliance program should be tailored\nto an organization's specific needs, risks, and challenges,\nthe information provided below should not be considered\na substitute for a company’s own assessment of the corpo-\nrate compliance program most appropriate for that particu-\nlar business organization. In the end, if designed carefully,\nimplemented earnestly, and enforced fairly, a company’s\ncompliance program—no matter how large or small the\norganization—will allow the company generally to prevent\nviolations, detect those that do occur, and remediate them\n\npromptly and appropriately.\n\nCommitment from Senior Management and a\nClearly Articulated Policy Against Corruption\nWithin a business organization, compliance begins\nwith the board of directors and senior executives setting\nthe proper tone for the rest of the company. Managers and\nemployees take their cues from these corporate leaders.\nThus, DOJ and SEC consider the commitment of corpo-\nrate leaders to a “culture of compliance”?! and look to see\nif this high-level commitment is also reinforced and imple-\nmented by middle managers and employees at all levels of\n\na business. A well-designed compliance program that is\n\nnot enforced in good faith, such as when corporate man-\nagement explicitly or implicitly encourages employees to\nengage in misconduct to achieve business objectives, will be\nineffective. DOJ and SEC have often encountered compa-\nnies with compliance programs that are strong on paper but\nthat nevertheless have significant FCPA violations because\nmanagement has failed to effectively implement the pro-\ngram even in the face of obvious signs of corruption. This\nmay be the result of aggressive sales staff preventing com-\npliance personnel from doing their jobs effectively and of\nsenior management, more concerned with securing a valu-\nable business opportunity than enforcing a culture of com-\npliance, siding with the sales team. The higher the financial\nstakes of the transaction, the greater the temptation for\nmanagement to choose profit over compliance.\n\nA strong ethical culture directly supports a strong\ncompliance program. By adhering to ethical standards,\nsenior managers will inspire middle managers to reinforce\nthose standards. Compliant middle managers, in turn, will\nencourage employees to strive to attain those standards\nthroughout the organizational structure?”\n\nIn short, compliance with the FCPA and ethical rules\nmust start at the top. DOJ and SEC thus evaluate whether\nsenior management has clearly articulated company stan-\ndards, communicated them in unambiguous terms, adhered\nto them scrupulously, and disseminated them throughout\n\nthe organization.\n\nCode of Conduct and Compliance Policies and\nProcedures\n\nA company’s code of conduct is often the foundation\nupon which an effective compliance program is built. As\nDOJ has repeatedly noted in its charging documents, the\nmost effective codes are clear, concise, and accessible to all\nemployees and to those conducting business on the com-\npany’s behalf. Indeed, it would be difficult to effectively\nimplement a compliance program if it was not available in\nthe local language so that employees in foreign subsidiaries\ncan access and understand it. When assessing a compliance\n\nprogram, DOJ and SEC will review whether the company\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022559",
