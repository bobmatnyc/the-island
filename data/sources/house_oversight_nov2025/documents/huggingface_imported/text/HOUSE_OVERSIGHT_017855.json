See § 16030o)(2) Gtating agen-\ncy or instrumentality is entity whose ma-\njority ownership interest is held by either\nthe foreign state or a political subdivision\nthereof); Filler v. Hanvit Bank, 378 F.3d\n213 (2d Cir.2004) (holding an organ’s own-\nership of two banks did not, in turn, make\nthe banks organs or instrumentalities of\nforeign state); see also In re Ski Train\nFire in Kaprun, Austria, 198 F.Supp.2d\n420, 426 (S.D.N.Y.2002) (holding ski resort\nowner, which was owned in part by instru-\nmentality of Austrian government, was not\ninstrumentality because it was not owned\ndirectly by the state or a subdivision there-\nof); Hyatt Corp. v. Stanton, 945 F.Supp.\n675, 688 (S.D.N.Y.1996) (concluding “that\ncorporations a majority of whose shares\nare owned by agencies or instrumentalities\nof foreign states are not themselves agen-\ncies or instrumentalities”). Thus, NCB\nmust demonstrate that the PIF is the\nequivalent of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia\nor a political subdivision thereof.\n\nThe PIF was established by Royal De-\ncree with the sole function of “financing\n\n. investments in productive projects of\na commercial nature whether they belong\nto the Government or the industrial lend-\ning institutions connected to it or to its\npublic corporations and whether these\nprojects are undertaken independently or\n\n349 FEDERAL SUPPLEMENT, 2d SERIES\n\nin partnership between these administra-\ntive parties and private institutions.” PIF\nCharter 12, at Berger Aff. Ex. 4B (“PIF\nCharter”); Affidavit of Abdallah Bin Ha-\nmad Al-Wohaibi 13, the Director of the\nLegal Department of the Ministry of Fi-\nnance, at Berger Aff. Ex. 4 (“Al-Wohaibi\nAff.”). Its board of directors are all Saudi\nofficials named in its charter, its employ-\nees are civil servants, and the Ministry of\nFinance is responsible for its costs. Jd.\n114, 8, 10; see also PIF Charter 114, 7.\nIts board must submit an annual report to\nSaudi Arabia’s Council of Ministers sum-\nmarizing its financial position and major\noperations. Al-Wohaibi Aff. 110. It has\nno separate legal status from the Ministry\nof Finance. /d. 14. The PIF holds shares\nof corporations and operational assets,\n“generally ... on behalf of the Ministry of\nFinance.” Jd. 19. It may be sued as a\ndepartment of the Ministry of Finance,\nand as such, the Ministry of Finance\nwould be named as the defendant. Jd.\n112. It funds investments on behalf of\nthe Kingdom and it provides financing\nterms for projects that commercial lenders\ndo not. Id. 15; Supplemental Al-Wohaibi\nAff. 118-10 (hereinafter “Supp. Al-Wohai-\nbi Aff.”).\n\na. Status of the PIF\n\nIn Filler v. Hanvit Bank, a case with\nfacts very similar to those presented here,\nthe Second Circuit reiterated Dole Food’s\nrequirement of direct ownership for instru-\nmentality status. Two defendants were\ncommercial banks majority-owned by the\nKorean Deposit Insurance Corporation\n(““KDIC”), a “governmental institution”\nrun by the Korean Ministry of Finance\nand the Economy of the Republic of Ko-\nrea. Filler, 378 F.3d at 215-16. In deter-\nmining if KDIC was an organ of Korea,\nthe court considered several factors:\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017855",
