My question had nothing to do with whether\nyou could identify girls that Jeffrey Epstein abused.\n\nMy question was: As of December 30th, 2014 -- you don't\nhave to give me the name right now -- is there any\nspecific girl that you had evidence Professor Dershowitz\nabused?\n\nA. What I had was the police report moving girls\nand the girls were named in the police report, although\nthe police report that I think has been made public has\nthe names redacted, those girls were moving through the\nmansion at the time when, for example, household staff\nwere saying that Mr. Dershowitz was receiving massages.\n\nAnd so, yes, I have 24 names in mind as\npossible sexual abuse victims that Dershowitz may or may\nnot have abused. And I have not been able to pinpoint\nexactly what happened, because the people who would be\nin the best position to help me sort out what the names\nwere, specifically Jeffrey Epstein among others, have\nrefused to cooperate and give me those names.\n\nMR. SIMPSON: Move to strike the\n\nnonresponsive portion of the answer.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Can I ask what part of that was\n\nnonresponsive in your view?\n\nMR. SCAROLA: That's all right.\n\nTHE WITNESS: Okay.\n\nROUGH DRAFT ONLY\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021853",
