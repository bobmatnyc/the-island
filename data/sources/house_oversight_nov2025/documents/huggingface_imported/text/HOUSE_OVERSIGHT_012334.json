And what am I going to do,\nbring my son over there to Jeffrey's, no, you know. So I\nfocused on my son. I had a beautiful baby boy that was\nmy pride and joy. I didn't care for anything else. I\ndidn’t care to tell friends. I dropped all my friends.\nLike he asked me do I have any numbers, no, you know. If\nanybody does call me, that's my mother. Like it was just\nme and my baby boy and it's been like that ever since.\n\nBY AGENT RICHARDS:\n\nQ. Having a baby is a life-changing experience,\nisn’t it?\n\nA. Having a baby?\n\nQ.
