I have been visiting both\ncountries, where many democratic activists have been comparing\ntheir situation with the more than 20 successful and failed democratic-\ntransition attempts throughout the world that I have observed and\nanalyzed.\n\nOne fear should be dismissed immediately: despite worries about the\nincompatibility of Islam and democracy, more than 500 million\nMuslims now live in Muslim-majority countries that are commonly\nclassified as democracies — Indonesia, Turkey, Bangladesh, Senegal,\nMali, and Albania. But, for almost 40 years, not a single Arab-\nmajority country has been classified as a democracy, so a democratic\ntransition in either Tunisia or Egypt (or elsewhere in the region)\nwould be of immense importance for the entire Arab world.\nTunisia’s chances of becoming a democracy before the year ends are,\nI believe, surprisingly good. A key factor here is that the military is\nnot complicating the transition to democracy. Tunisia has a small\nmilitary (only about 36,000 soldiers), and, since independence in\n1956, it had been led by two party-based non-democratic leaders who\nstrove to keep the military out of politics.\n\nMoreover, the current civilian-led interim government engages in at\nleast some negotiations about the new democratic rules of the game\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_030064",
