  "text": "Syria. We could halt at that stage, in the unlikely event Hizbollah showed signs\nof de-escalation. But if it didn’t, the air strikes would intensify. The aim was not\ntarget the nearly 250,000 Lebanese civilians who lived in the immediate border\narea. It was to use our attacks, along with leaflet drops and radio messages, to\nencourage them to flee north. My assessment was that this would bring pressure\non the Lebanese government and, through the Lebanese, on the real power in\nLebanon, the Syrians. I doubted Damascus would respond directly by telling\nHizbollah to cease fire. I did believe they’d be ready to engage with American\nefforts to stop the fighting, and that Rabin and the government could then secure\nterms we were prepared to accept.\n\nOn July 25, we began our heaviest air strikes since 1982. Far from producing\na sign of a climb-down by Hizbollah, it responded with intensified rocket fire.\nWe escalated over the following 24 hours, but still with no indication of any\nchange from Hizbollah. So as planned, we expanded our bombing to wider\nareas of south Lebanon. Sadly, some Lebanese civilians were killed, which I’m\nsure was a much greater cause of concern to us than to Hizbollah. Thankfully,\nhowever, the majority fled north. In south Lebanon, this meant that our jets and\nartillery had much greater freedom of operation against Hizbollah, which had\nnow lost its human shields. In Beirut, a government suddenly overwhelmed\nwith the need to provide shelter for the large number of refugees from the\nfighting did press Syrian President Assad to help bring it to an end. Critically,\nthe new Clinton Administration, especially Secretary of State Warren\nChristopher, reinforced that message.\n\nOur military operation lasted just a week. It did not end Hizbollah attacks on\nIsraeli troops in the security zone, something I think even most Israelis were\ncoming to realize was impossible as long as our soldiers remained in Lebanon.\nBut the rocket attacks on northern Israel did stop, with very few exceptions, for\na period that lasted nearly two years.\n\nThe intifada, however, had not stopped. Nor, as I knew from my increasingly\nfrequent meetings with Rabin, had the search for a way both to control the\nviolence, and seek out any realistic prospect of a political path to resolving our\nconflict with our Arab neighbors.\n\n252\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_011723",
