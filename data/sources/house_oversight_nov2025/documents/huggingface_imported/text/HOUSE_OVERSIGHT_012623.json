When | receive the originals, | will sign and return one\ncopy to you. The other will be placed in the case file, which will ba kept confidential since it also\ncontains identifying information about the girls.\n\nWhen we reach an agreement about the altiorney representative for the girls, we can discuss\nwhat | can tell him and the girls about the agreement. | know that Andy promised Chief Reiter\nan update when a resolution was achieved. (Something | wouldn’t have promised in light of what\nhappened last year.) Rolando is calling, but Rolando knows not to tell Chief Reiter about the\nmoney issue, just about what crimes Mr. Epstein is pleading guilty to and the amount of time that\nhas been agreed to. Rolanda also is telling Chief Reiter not to disclase the outcome to anyone.\n\nFrom: Jay Lefkowitz\nSent: Monday, September 24, 2007 4:06 PM\n\nTo: Villafana, Ann Marie C, (USAFLS)\nSubject: Re: Do you have a signed copy?\n\nMarie - Please do whatever you can to keep this from becoming public.\n\nthanks -- Jay\n\ne a\n\nce\n09/24/2007 04:04 PM SubjectDo you have a signed copy?\n\nHi Jay — Sorry to be a bother, but do you have a copy that at least contains Mr. Epstein’s\nsignature?
