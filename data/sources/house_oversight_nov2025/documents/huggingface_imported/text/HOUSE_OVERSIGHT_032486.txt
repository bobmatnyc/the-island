Thanks Darren

Good news!

I'm under the impression that checks will be exceptional (they are more cumbersome to handle), and we will

use mostly wires.

Considering the time difference, my heavy travel and my own propension to do things at night and on week-
ends | would much prefer having an internet code and be able to organize everything online when | need to.

When | use Interaudi (my US bank), they can do that, store the recurring beneficiaries, and do wires in

multiple currencies, but | am not familiar with DB.
