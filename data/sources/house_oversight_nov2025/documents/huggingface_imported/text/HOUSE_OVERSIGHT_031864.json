It is defeated by Israel's strategic advantage of interior\nlines.\n\nIsraeli Geography and the Convergence Zone\n\nTherefore, it is not surprising that Israel's first incarnation lasted as\nlong as it did — some five centuries. What is interesting and what\nmust be considered is why Israel (now considered as the northern\nkingdom) was defeated by the Assyrians and Judea, then defeated by\nBabylon. To understand this, we need to consider the broader\ngeography of Israel's location.\n\nIsrael is located on the eastern shore of the Mediterranean Sea, on the\nLevant. As we have seen, when Israel is intact, it will tend to be the\ndominant power in the Levant. Therefore, Israeli resources must\ngenerally be dedicated for land warfare, leaving little over for naval\nwarfare. In general, although Israel had excellent harbors and access\nto wood for shipbuilding, it never was a major Mediterranean naval\npower. It never projected power into the sea. The area to the north of\nIsrael has always been a maritime power, but Israel, the area south of\nMount Hermon, was always forced to be a land power.\n\nThe Levant in general and Israel in particular has always been a\nmagnet for great powers. No Mediterranean empire could be fully\nsecure unless it controlled the Levant. Whether it was Rome or\nCarthage, a Mediterranean empire that wanted to control both the\nnorthern and southern littorals needed to anchor its eastern flank on\nthe Levant. For one thing, without the Levant, a Mediterranean power\nwould be entirely dependent on sea lanes for controlling the other\nshore. Moving troops solely by sea creates transport limitations and\nlogistical problems. It also leaves imperial lines vulnerable to\ninterdiction — sometimes merely from pirates, a problem that\nplagued Rome's sea transport. A land bridge, or a land bridge with\nminimal water crossings that can be easily defended, is a vital\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031864",
