  "text": "We see also:\n\nAbout BL: \"Bin Laden established camps inside Khyber Pakhtunkhwa in Pakistan and trained\nvolunteers from across the Muslim world to fight against the Soviet-backed regime, the Democratic\nRepublic of Afghanistan” (Wikipedia)\n\nAbout EP: \"In his autobiography, he states that during the Yugoslav Wars in the early 1990s, he\nrealized the need for private training facilities for special operations... Prince moved to Virginia\nBeach and personally financed the formation of Blackwater Worldwide in 1997. He bought 6,000\nacres (24 km2) of the Great Dismal Swamp of North Carolina and set up a school for special\noperations” (Wikipedia)\n\nErik Prince is (becoming) no less an Amer. intelligence success story than bin Laden (in support of\nTerrorism as Geostrategy & a New World Order - see below). In short: (we note the repeating 9/11s,\nevery 11 years): \"Toward a NWO\" speech by Bush #41 - Sept. 11 (90); The WTC - Sept. 11 (01);\nBenghazi - Sept. 11 (12). (There is rhy. & reason also 2 the rise of ISIS.)\n\nKKK\n\nAbout training camps:\n\n| watched so to speak the creating of little torture pockets around the world as justified by Obama's\ndesire to close Gitmo. The White House reports (2/23/16): \"We'll continue to securely and\nresponsibly transfer to other countries the 35 detainees already approved for transfer. This process\ninvolves extensive and careful coordination across our federal government to ensure that our\nnational security interests are met when an individual is transferred to another country. We insist, for\nexample, that foreign countries institute strong security measures.” But are these not just the seeds\nof new training camps (growing concentrated and lauded violent temperaments) & was that not\nsomeone's exact intent?\n\nIn real-time (and as perpetrated on captured children):\n\n3/19/14, sent to the now defunct FB page of D. Cheney:\nDick Cheney,\n\n| wonder if it's possible that there is coordination with other countries concerning enhanced\ninterrogation techniques, in the form of training perhaps?\n\nSpecifically, here in the United States, my sense is that there may be the use of vulnerable\n\npopulations, with the intension to gain favor with and/or intimidate others, especially members of the\ninternational community.\n\n*\n\nAnd:\n\nOn Saturday, June 21, 2014 6:37 AM, EE wrote:\n1 ae\n\nDeputy Lyddy,\n\nHer energy is very weak. She is physically exhausted, VERY sleep deprived, and HUNGRY.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015026",
