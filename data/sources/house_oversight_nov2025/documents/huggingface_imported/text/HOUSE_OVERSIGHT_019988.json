  "text": "hardly recognizable in any sort of official Republican or conservative way. He was a post-\nright-wing provocateur but with none of the dinner party waspishness or bite of Ann\nCoulter or Milo Yiannopoulos. They were a stagey type of reactionary. He was a real one\n—a genuine racist with a good education, in his case UVA, the University of Chicago, and\nDuke.\n\nIt was Bannon who effectively gave Spencer flight by pronouncing Breitbart to be “the\nplatform for the alt-right’—the movement Spencer claimed to have founded, or at least\nowned the domain name for.\n\n“T don’t think Bannon or Trump are identitarians or alt-rightists,” Spencer explained\nwhile camped out just over CPAC’s property line at the Gaylord. They were not, like\nSpencer, philosophic racists (itself different from a knee-jerk racist). “But they are open to\nthese ideas. And open to the people who are open to these ideas. We’re the spice in the\n\n29\n\nmix.\n\nSpencer was right. Trump and Bannon, with Sessions in the mix, too, had come closer\nthan any major national politician since the Civil Rights movement to tolerating a race-\ntinged political view.\n\n“Trump has said things that conservatives never would have thought... . His criticism\nof the Iraq War, bashing the Bush family, I couldn’t believe he did that ... but he did... .\nFuck them ... if at the end of the day an Anglo Wasp family produces Jeb and W then\nclearly that’s a clear sign of denegation... . And now they marry Mexicans ... Jeb’s wife\n... he married his housekeeper or something.\n\n“In Trump’s 2011 CPAC address he specifically calls for a relaxation of immigration\nrestrictions for Europeans ... that we should re-create an America that was far more stable\nand more beautiful... . No other conservative politician would say those things ... but on\nthe other hand pretty much everyone thought it ... so it’s powerful to say it... . Clearly\n[there’s] a normalization process going on.”\n\n“We are the Trump vanguard. The left will say Trump is a nationalist and an implicit or\nquasi-racialist. Conservatives, because they are just so douchey, say Oh, no, of course not,\nhe’s a constitutionalist, or whatever. We on the alt-right will say, He is a nationalist and he\nis a racialist. His movement is a white movement. Duh.”\n\nLooking very satisfied with himself, Spencer paused and then said: “We give him a\nkind of permission.”\n\nOOK Ok\n\nNearby, in the Gaylord atrtum, Rebekah Mercer sat having a snack with her home-\nschooled daughter and her friend and fellow conservative donor Allie Hanley. Both\nwomen agreed that the president’s CPAC speech showed him at his most gracious and\ncharming.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_019988",
