Europe's largest contemporary art fair has staked its tent in Regent's Park, bringing with it\nan estimated $375 million in work by brand-name artists and emerging talents alike, and London is seething with\nexhibitions and events to welcome the collectors, tastemakers, and various art grandees descending on the city.\nWhat to see? Where to go? ARTINFO UK has a few recommendations.\n\nWEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 14\n\nYou've done Tate Britain, do you really need to go to Tate Modern? Of course you do. First, the newly opened\nGauguin exhibition is stunning and simply impossible to miss (it has been described by the Times as \"the show of\nthe season -- in fact of the whole year). Second, the new commission by Ai Weiwei, was recently unveiled in\nTurbine Hall. You can then head north to enjoy Fergus Henderson's English cuisine at St. John Bar & Restaurant in\nSmithfield, before wandering to ROKEBY for their exhibition of German-born, London-based artist Bettina Buck.\n\nToday is also a good day to see \"The House of the Noble Man,\" an exhibition curated by artist Wolfe von\nLenkiewicz and Russian curator Victoria Golembiovskayan. It includes a Cézanne, £6 million ($9.6 million) worth of\nPicasso, as well as pieces by Damien Hirst, Christian Boltanski, Andy Warhol, Gerhard Richter, and many more --\nall in the historical setting of Cornwall Terrace as it overlooks Regent's Park. (This event is by appointment only at\nBoswell House, 2 Cornwall Terrace, Regents Park, London NW1.
