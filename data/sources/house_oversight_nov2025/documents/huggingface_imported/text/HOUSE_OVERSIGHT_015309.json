  "text": "like a miracle, which is merely because of our very narrow concept of how\nthe universe works.”\n\nRam Dass knew of my involvement with conspiracy theory. “I'm just\ninvolved in a much greater conspiracy,” he continued. “You can't grasp\nthe size of the conspiracy | understand--but there's no conspirator--it's the\nwrong word. That's why | say it's just natural law. It is all perfect.”\n\n“Would you agree with the concept--what William Blake said, that\nhumans were created ‘for joy and woe'--the implication of which is that\nthere will always be suffering?”\n\n“| think that suffering is part of man's condition, and that's what\nthe incarnation is about, and that's what the human plane is.”\n\nSo | asked Ram Dass, “If you and | were to exchange philosophies--\nif | believed in reincarnation and you didn't--how do you think our\nbehavior would change?” He paused fora moment. “Well,” he said, “if\nyou believed in reincarnation, you would never ask a question like that.”\n\nAnd then his low chuckle of amusement and surprise blossomed\ninto an uproarious belly laugh of delight and triumph as he savored the\nimplications of his own Zen answer. | would find myself playing that\nsegment of the tape with his bell-shaped spasm of laughter over and over\n\nagain, like a favorite piece of music.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015309",
