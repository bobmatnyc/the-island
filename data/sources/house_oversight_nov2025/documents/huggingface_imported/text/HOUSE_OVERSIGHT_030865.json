However, if Democrats keep the Presidency and take Senate or \nRepublicans take the Presidency and keep Senate, it likely brings policy uncertainty and market volatility. \nLonger-term, it will be the policies and implementation that will influence markets, which both parties, many \nindividuals and circumstances will craft. This note identifies sectors, industries and stocks that we think would \nbe price sensitive to an unbalanced election outcome tilted toward one party. \nDividing issues: Taxes, trade, favored infrastructure types and monetary policy \nIt's difficult to pin down specific policies from either candidate, but on several economic issues their general \nbias is clear. These issues include taxes, trade deals, favored types of infrastructure — such as green vs \nconventional energy, preference for monetary policy, and also their expressed views on industries such as \nHealth Care and Energy. It is the gist of the candidate's preference on these issues that we used to identify \nsectors and stocks sensitive to a sweep. \nBig banks might outperform small banks and oil might go down on Rep sweep \nWhile many of our conclusions align with conventional judgment, we think we differ in that we think a Rep \nsweep could: 1) be good for some domestic oil producers, as it should permit more drilling, but negative to the \nrecovery in oil and gas prices, as more supply, and thus negative for the broad Energy sector, 2) bring \nsomewhat faster Fed hikes and a stronger dollar than otherwise, 3) the first two could lead to lower inflation \nand a flatter yield curve than otherwise would be. One could argue that Trump sized tax cuts and an \ninfrastructure and defense spending spree would steepen the curve, but we think this unlikely while \nRepublicans control the House. If Fed hikes bring yield curve flattening then big banks and capital markets \nlikely outperform small banks and insurance companies. Slow hikes that allow inflation to accelerate and \nsteepen the curve might favor smaller banks and insurance, but this could pressure PEs at non-financials. If \nthe Fed falls too far behind the curve, higher long-term rates could threaten the stock market, real estate and \nthe overall economy. \nEquity strategy election tnernes: vary- sweep petter tor investor confidence on \nTaxes-R, Trade-D, Infrastructure-RID, Faster Fed hikes-R, Higher inflation target-D, Steeper curve-D, stronger \ndollar-R, stock market-R/D, large caps-R, small caps-D, globally exposed S&P stocks-R, domestically exposed \nS&P-D, higher commodity prices-D, lighter regulations-R, foreign profit repatriation-R. \nIndustry pair trades and ETF ideas for Democratic vs. Republican Sweep \n1) Favor Health Care Services & Facilities over Drugs & Medical Devices \n2) Favor Engineering & Construction over Defense stocks \n3) Favor Small Banks & Life Insurance over Big Banks and Capital Mkts \n4) Favor Energy majors over Oil Services and smaller domestic E&Ps \n5) Favor Clean Energy & Social Media over Cheap Energy & Telco/Cable \n6) Favor Metals & Mining over Chemicals & Construction Materials \nDem: IHF, GEX, XME, SOCL, !WM, KBE.
