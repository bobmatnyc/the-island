While she acknowledges that there is not much diversity in\nthe nature of the views represented by ICAS—there is no overt criticism of Chinese\ngovernment policies—she is hopeful that once ICAS gains greater standing, it will be\nable to attract senior scholars from other institutions with a greater range of views to\nwrite for its website.\n\nMore recently, Chinese publishing entrepreneur Zhou Zhixing has established the\nUS-China New Perspectives Foundation, with offices in both Los Angeles and\nWashington, DC. As of yet, these offices have no track record of activities or publications.\nIt is likely that more such think tanks initiated with or without formal Chinese\ngovernment support will follow in the United States.\n\nThink-Tank Funding\n\nDifferent US think tanks have different funding models. At least one type (Federally\nFunded Research and Development Centers, or FFRDCs) is funded entirely by the\nUS government, while several others accept some US government funding, as well\nas money from other governments on a contracted work basis. Three think tanks\ninterviewed accept no US or other government funding: One is funded entirely\nby central operating funds from an endowment, while two others rely on a mix\nof foundation and private support. One think tank’s work is funded entirely by\nfoundations. Most interviewees allow Chinese funders to pay for travel and meeting\ncosts to Beijing for conferences, while a few categorically do not—either because of\nregulations or on the principle of conflict of interest.\n\nAt least one think tank differentiates between funding that is dedicated to its work\n\nin Washington and that which supports its center in China. For the center in China,\n\na US-based scholar has raised funds from the China Development Bank, Huawei\nCorporation, and private entrepreneurs from Hong Kong. This same think tank has a\n“China Council” of donors (including Chinese Americans, but no Chinese nationals)\nthat supports the think tank’s activities. Some US institutions refuse to accept funds\nfrom China-based commercial entities, although they are occasionally willing to\naccept donations from their US-based subsidiaries. Other think tanks, however, accept\nfunds from Chinese corporations and individual businesspeople. One has taken money\nfrom Alibaba America for a particular event celebrating the fifteenth anniversary of\nWTO accession; another has taken money from the Chinese real estate firm Vanke for\na project on the environment. A Chinese businessman, Fu Chen, supports work at one\nChina center that also has several prominent Chinese businesspersons on its board.\nOne has an advisory council with Chinese Americans, and yet another think tank\n\nis building an advisory council that will include Chinese, but only those who have\nbecome American citizens. (This analyst is also considering accepting private Chinese\nmoney but not money from Chinese state-owned enterprises.)\n\nThink Tanks\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020525",
