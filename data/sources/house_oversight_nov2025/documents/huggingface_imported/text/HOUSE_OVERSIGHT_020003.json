  "text": "According to CNN, “Iwo former senior U.S. officials quickly dismissed Trump’s\naccusations out of hand. ‘Just nonsense,’ said one former senior U.S. intelligence official.”\nInside the White House, the “just nonsense” quote was thought to be from Ben Rhodes,\noffered in cat-that-swallowed-the-canary fashion.\n\nRyan, for his part, told Priebus he had no idea what Baier was talking about and that he\nwas just BSing through the interview.\n\nBut if tapping Trump’s phones wasn’t literally true, there was a sudden effort to find\nsomething that might be, and a frantic White House dished up a Breitbart article that\nlinked to a piece by Louise Mensch, a former British politician who, now living in the\nUnited States, had become a kind of conspiracy-central of the Trump-Russia connection.\n\nThere was a further effort to push aggressive incidental collection and unmasking back\nonto the Obama White House. But in the end, this was another—and to some quite the\nultimate—example of how difficult it was for the president to function in a literal,\ndefinitional, lawyerly, cause-and-effect political world.\n\nIt was a turning point. Until now, Trump’s inner circle had been mostly game to defend\nhim. But after the wiretap tweets, everybody, save perhaps Hope Hicks, moved into a state\nof queasy sheepishness, if not constant incredulity.\n\nSean Spicer, for one, kept repeating his daily, if not hourly, mantra: “You can’t make\nthis shit up.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020003",
