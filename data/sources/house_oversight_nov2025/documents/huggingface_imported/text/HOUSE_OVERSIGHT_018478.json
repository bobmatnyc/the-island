Very rarely, I'll end up with a BDSM partner where our brief\nin-the-moment communications -- you know, like groans, or physical shifts, or facial\nexpressions, or even jokes -- function very well. We can get into intense, intimate S&M\nin a way that seems almost instinctive (although it helps future encounters if we talk it\nover and process what we did afterwards). This is really exciting when it happens, but I\nrecognize it as unusual. A gift.\n\nThe person I'm about to write about is totally going to get a swelled head because I write\nabout him so much, but he's such a good example, I have to. The first time I went home\nwith him, I knew he wasn't in the public BDSM community. We'd had one really vague\nconversation about BDSM previously, and he'd read a small sample of my work. I didn't\nexpect anything much.\n\nHe kissed me, and then I think he gave me some kind of mild signal like a bite on my\nshoulder. It was a gentle bite, by my standards. So I took matters into my own hands and\nremoved my shirt, preparing to give him some feedback. He leaned back and said,\n\"Whoa,\" and I thought, Oh damn, I'm totally going too fast for him, he's probably not\naccustomed to a high degree of sexual directness, so | said, \"Sorry, is this okay?\" and he\nlaughed and kind of threw up his hands and said, \"Sure.\"\n\nThat made me a tad nervous -- if me taking off my shirt surprised him, what else would\nsurprise him? -- but I figured I'd see it through, see what happened. So I explained to him\nwhat kind of biting I really like, and showed where I like it on my back and my arms. I\nthink I gave him a couple of other tips, too, but I honestly can't remember; it didn't take\nmore than five minutes. I certainly didn't give him an exhaustive rundown of my\npreferences before I said, \"Does that all make sense?\" and he said \"Yes,\" and put his\nhands on me.\n\nWhich is why it was so surprising that within a very short time, both of us were breathing\nhard and confused and maybe slightly dizzy and looking at each other with very wide\neyes, and he was saying in an amazed tone: \"I just -- I'm a little shocked. That was really\ngood,\" and I was saying: \"Yes. Yes it was.\"\n\nIt went like that for a while. He'd go for it, and then pull back, and I'd drag myself out of\nmy BDSM headspace long enough to explain one or two ideas, or reassure him that I felt\nfine. And then he'd go for it again. And by the end of it, I was -- blazing.\n\nSometimes, it just works. You've never met this person before, you've talked for half an\nhour about something completely irrelevant like science fiction novels, yet it only takes\nfive minutes of discussion about preferences and safewords, and then it just works. I\ndon't know why, and I don't know how, but sometimes you find a partner who can just --\nread you, like an open book -- or who seems as transparent as glass to you; or, if you're\nreally lucky, both.\n\n(But I write about this with some hesitation, and I'm putting it at the end of this post after\ntwo other examples for a reason: because I don't think it's the standard, and I don't think it\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_018478",
