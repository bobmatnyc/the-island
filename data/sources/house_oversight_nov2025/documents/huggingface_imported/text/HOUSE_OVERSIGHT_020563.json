First, China is supporting\n\nan increasing number of local chambers of commerce in the United States with direct\n\nties to CCP officials. Second, as Chinese companies have become more global, they\n\nhave also grown more sophisticated in their efforts to socialize and localize\n\nthemselves in their new American communities, but also acquire political influence\n\nin the United States. Finally, China increased its efforts to pressure, co-opt and sometimes\neven coerce foreign corporations with the aim of influencing politics in their home\ncountries.\n\nThe Use of Business-Related United Front Organizations\n\nConsistent with the practice of other nations, major Chinese firms operating in America\n\nare represented by a chamber of commerce network. Analysis detailed below suggests\n\nthat China also operates an extensive list of United Front organizations purporting to\n\nbe regional chambers of commerce. China’s public-facing chamber in the United States\n\nis known as the China General Chamber of Commerce (CGCC), which was founded in\n2005. It is headquartered in New York with five regional operations in Chicago, Houston,\nLos Angeles, San Francisco, and Washington, DC. Its website states that it has 1,500 member\ncompanies, both Chinese and non-Chinese. The organization’s chair is Bank of China USA\npresident and CEO Xu Chen. Its website lists more than sixty individuals, many from state-\nowned companies, in governance roles; its website lists a staff of nine.\n\nConsistent with business organizations of other countries, the CGCC engages in a mix\n\nof political engagement with its host and home countries (e.g., testifying at the US\nInternational Trade Commission® and hosting officials from the Chinese Ministry of\nCommerce’); informational activities for its members (e.g., a lunch-and-learn on labor\n\nand safety issues in the United States);’ and promotional activities (e.g., dinner galas and\ncharity events). The CGCC is actively engaged with senior American political and business\nleaders. In July 2017, it hosted a welcome luncheon at the National Governors Association\nmeeting in Rhode Island, at which the governors of Maryland, Kentucky, Alaska, Arizona,\nLouisiana, and Rhode Island attended. In September 2017, the group organized the visit of\nthe governors of Alaska and Missouri to China.®\n\nInconsistent with the practice of other countries, China also oversees an extensive network\nof local chambers of commerce. This raises a question of their possible ties to the Chinese\nparty-state, and whether these chambers may be misrepresenting themselves as local\nconcerns when they are instead activated by, or in liaison with, the Chinese government.\nResearch for this project has identified thirty-one business-focused organizations operating\nin the United States that are explicitly associated with or whose profiles and activities\n\nare highly suggestive of involvement with United Front work.’ Most of these groups are\nconcentrated in Greater Los Angeles and New York City, two principal communities of the\nChinese diaspora. They are typically organized by hometown province of origin. This count\n\nCorporations\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020563",
