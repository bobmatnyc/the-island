  "text": "as looking like a bowl of cold porridge. To get to the porridge you\n\nmust first cut through the skull, a two-millimeter thick protective\nlayer of bone. The adult human skull has almost no gaps in it, and the\nonly ways into the brain without a bone saw are through the eye sockets\nor the soft area of bone at the back of the nose. Egyptian mummies had\ntheir brains removed through the nose and preserved in a jar for the\nafterlife!\n\nP hysically the human brain is very boring. Alan Turing described it\n\nThinking with Porridge\n\nProtecting the brain is very important and the skull does a good job\nby being a tough, impenetrable barrier. But sometimes this toughness\nbackfires. In 2009, Richard Hammond, one of the presenters of the TV\nmotoring series Top Gear, suffered a crash while testing a land speed\nrecord-breaking car. Although he was in a multipoint harness, the\ncrash, at over 200 miles per hour, bounced his helmeted head around\nthe inside of the cockpit and his brain was badly bruised. As you know\nfrom experience, when you bruise you get swelling, and the brain is\nno exception. However, the brain is encased in bone, so this swelling\nhas nowhere to escape. The resulting buildup of pressure is dangerous,\ncausing an interruption of blood supply to the un-bruised parts. Brain\ndamage in such accidents is often fatal; Richard Hammond was very\nlucky to live through the experience.\n\nSurgeons often need to cut into the skull to relieve pressure on\nthe brain, or to gain access to remove tumors. Going through the scalp\ninvolves a great deal of blood, but once you have a clean hole in the skull\nyou can peel back the thin membranes, called the meninges, to reveal a\nwrinkly folded whitish thing that looks a bit like a cauliflower. This is the\nouter surface of the brain where much of our thinking is done. Unfolded,\nthis surface layer would cover the area of a football field and this intense\nfolding distinguishes the human brain from the brains of simpler animals.\nSome animals, such as elephants and dolphins, have larger brains than\nours, but the area of their folded surface is considerably smaller. It is\nthought that this efficient folding is key to giving us the ability to think\ncomplex thoughts.\n\nAnalysis of Einstein’s brain held at Princeton University shows it\nis not particularly massive, but it is strikingly more folded than average,\nand has a shorter lateral sulcus - the fissure between the front and back\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015787",
