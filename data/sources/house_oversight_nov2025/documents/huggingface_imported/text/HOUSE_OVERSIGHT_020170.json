In it, Snowden identified himself as\nan infrastructure analyst at a regional base of National Security Agency that was located in Oahu,\nHawaii. He revealed in a calm, unemotional voice that he had been the source for the stories in\nboth the Guardian and the Washington Post. He said that he had supplied the secret, classified\ndocuments that the two newspapers had used in their scoops about domestic surveillance being\nconducted by the NSA, America’s enormous electronic surveillance agency. These sensational\nrevelations had been, literally, the talk of the world, and now, in another major news event, the\nboyish-looking Snowden revealed his responsibility for what would turn out to be the largest theft\nof top-secret documents in the history of U.S. intelligence.\n\nIn the video, Snowden was questioned by Glenn Greenwald, an American journalist living in\nBrazil who had broken the NSA story in the Guardian. What was his motive? Greenwald asked.\nWhy did he do it? Snowden replied that he had become horrified by the NSA’s secret operations\nwhich, to him, represented a kind of distillation of the excesses of the American national security\nstate, and he therefore made it his mission to blow the whistle. He believed that the public needed\nto be informed of the existence of a vast, secret surveillance operation directed against tens of\nmillions of Americans that flagrantly violated US laws and was a grave threat to their privacy and\ntheir freedoms. Within hours of the release of that video on the Guardian website, Snowden\nwas one of the most famous people in the world, celebrated by his supporters as a courageous\nwhistle-blower.\n\nThe Snowden interview in the video subsequently was expanded by the documentary filmmaker\nLaura Poitras into the two-hour movie CitizenFour, which won the 2015 academy-award for the\nbest documentary. Poitras said in accepting her Oscar in the Academy Awards Theater in\nHollywood on February 22\" 2015, that Snowden acted as a whistle-blower not only to “expose a\nthreat to our privacy but to our democracy itself.” She received a standing ovation. The film\nconvincingly depicts Snowden as an altruistic young man who is willing to risk his own personal\nfreedom and face years of imprisonment for the sake of others. Adding to the drama, almost all\nthe footage of Snowden in the film is from interviews with him in the confines of Snowden’s small\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020170",
