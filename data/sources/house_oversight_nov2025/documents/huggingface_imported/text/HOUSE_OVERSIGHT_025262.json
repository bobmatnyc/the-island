  "text": "Eurozone equities\n\nPreference: neutral\n\nEuro Stoxx (24 Oct): 247 (last publication: 247)\nUBS View Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 249\n\n¢ We keep our neutral stance on Eurozone equities. While the sovereign debt crisis remains a risk factor\n(see slide 8), the conditional bond buying program by the ECB (OMT) and the introduction of the ESM have\nsignificantly reduced downside risks.\n\n¢ Near-term we might see volatility increasing as politicians wrangle about the steps needed to provide a\nmore lasting solution to the debt crisis (setup of a single banking regulator, solving the banking related\nproblems in Spain, etc. ). We think that attractive valuations sufficiently compensate for those risks.\n\n¢ The weak economic environment with recessions in the southern countries continues to weigh on\ncorporate earnings. Consensus expectations (bottom up) of about 10% to 15% earnings growth in 2013 is\ntoo high, in our view. In contrast, we forecast just about 3-5% earnings growth next year.\n\n4 Positive scenario Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 320\n¢ Global economic growth reaccelerates and Eurozone growth shows clear signs of bottoming out,\nenabling mid-single-digit earnings growth over the next six months. The trailing P/E ratio could re-rate to\nabout 14.5x from its current reading of about 11.7x.\n\nNegative scenario Euro Stoxx (6-month target): 200\n¢ The debt crisis leads to renewed pressure on Spain and Italy. However, downside risks are expected to be\nless severe now, after the ECB has put its new bond-buying program in place.\n\n¢ Earnings could fall about 5% to 10% from current levels over the coming six months, and the trailing P/E\nratio could drop to a level around 10x over a six-month period.\n\nNote: Scenarios refer to global economic scenarios (see slide 7)\n\nWhat we're watching Why it matters\nGrowth indicators Economic growth indicators provide information on the development of a\npotential Eurozone recession.
