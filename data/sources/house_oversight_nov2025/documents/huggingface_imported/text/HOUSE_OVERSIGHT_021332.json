  "text": "Empathy can be defined as our\nnatural capacity to share, appreciate, and\nrespond to the affective states of others.\nThis capacity is essential for the\nregulation of social interactions. For\ninstance, empathy is believed to\nmotivate prosocial behavior and inhibit\naggressive behavior (2). In addition, our\nability to share the emotions of those we\nobserve binds us to each other and\nfosters a collective social identity.\nEmpathy’s invisible power is that it\nmoves us to cooperate, coordinate our\nbehaviors, and provide the needed care\nfor one another. Notably, however,\nempathic concern does not necessarily\nlead to empathic behavior. First,\nempathy poses a paradox, as sharing of\nfeelings does not necessarily imply that\none will act or even feel impelled to act\nin a supportive or sympathetic way.\nSecond, the complexity of the social and\nemotional situations eliciting empathic\nconcern influences the probability and\nnature of the help provided. Whether and\nhow empathic actions are expressed\ndepends on the feelings we perceive in\nthe other, our relationship with that\nindividual, and the context in which we\nshare an emotional state.\n\nEmpathy is critical for complex\nhuman interactions, but this does not\nmean that empathy and prosocial\nbehavior have suddenly appeared with\nHomo sapiens. If empathy is a potent\ninvisible force generated by the social\nbrain, some form of emotion-sharing\nshould also be evident in other social\nspecies such as non-human primates.\nIndeed, field observations conducted by\ncomparative psychologists and\nethologists suggest that behaviors\nhomologous to empathy can be found in\nnon-human primates (2). Some have\nargued that empathy is not an all-or-\nnothing phenomenon, and that many\n\nPage | 86\n\nintermediate forms of empathy exist\nbetween the extremes of mere agitation\nat the distress of another and full\nunderstanding of their predicaments (3).\nMany comparative psychologists view\nempathy as a kind of induction process\nby which emotions, both positive and\nnegative, are shared, and which increase\nthe probability that the protagonists will\nsubsequently engage in similar behavior.\n\nThough certain non-human\nprimates may share feelings between\nindividuals, humans seem to have the\nunique ability to intentionally “feel for”\nand act on behalf of other individuals\nwhose experiences may differ greatly\nfrom their own. Such a capacity may\nhelp explain why empathic concern is\noften associated with prosocial behaviors\nsuch as helping kin, and why it has been\nconsidered the foundation for altruism,\nthe expression of empathy and caring for\nthose who are not kin. Evolutionary\nbiologists have suggested that empathic\nhelping behavior evolved because of its\ncontribution to genetic fitness (kin\nselection). In humans and other\nmammals, an impulse to care for\noffspring is almost certainly genetically\nhard-wired. Less clear, however, is\nwhether an impulse to care for siblings,\nmore remote kin, and similar non-kin is\ngenetically hard-wired. The emergence\nof altruism is not easily explained within\nthe framework of neo-Darwinian\ntheories of natural selection (but see\nCacioppo’s chapter on this point). Social\nlearning explanations of kinship patterns\nin human helping behavior are thus\nhighly plausible. Indeed, one of the most\nstriking aspects of human empathy is\nthat it can be felt for virtually any\n“target,” even targets of a different\nspecies (animals included). We can see\na deer hurt by a passing car or the dogs\nlocked in crates at a shelter and feel\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021332",
