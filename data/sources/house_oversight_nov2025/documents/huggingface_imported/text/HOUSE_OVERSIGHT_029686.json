  "text": "We will need some more help from lan and Rory because we are still weak on international\ncommunication. Some old negative stuff keeps coming up in the Guardian newspaper in England. But\nmost of the international media is not paying much attention to Maldives right now.\n\n| have asked Rory to help find a full time communications guy to stay here for about a year to work with\nme. He doesn't have to be an expert, just a good graduate student would do. Some really positive stuff is\nalso happening now and we need the world to know about them.\n\nWorld Energy Forum and CGI guys are here. | am meeting Clinton people in a few minutes.\n\n| have some funding now but will ask all friends to help raise more later when things start happening in\nfull swing. Election is now scheduled to early September.\n\nHope all is well and look forward to seeing you here in the not too distant future.\nWarm regards,\nWaheed\n\nOn Jan 9, 2013, at 6:03 PM, Jeffrey Epstein wrote:\n\nhow is it shaping up? what are the biggest hurdles.\n\nOe ee oe ee ee eo ee ok ae ee ee a ee ee ee eo eee oe RR RR OR RK KK\n\nThe information contained in this communication is\nconfidential, may be attorney-client privileged, may\nconstitute inside information, and is intended only for\nthe use of the addressee.
