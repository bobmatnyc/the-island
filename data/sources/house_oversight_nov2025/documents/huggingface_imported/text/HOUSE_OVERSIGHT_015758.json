The\ncontents are, therefore, said to be black box equivalent.\n\nThe reason for teaching engineers about black boxes is to help them\nunderstand how to simplify things. We could construct option four, with\na cat and some food, but it would cost a great deal of money. Option 1 is\nfunctionally identical from an electrical point of view, but for a fraction\nof the cost. Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs were so successful when they\nstarted Apple because Wozniak was brilliant at simplifying logic circuits.\nHe could take a design with thirty chips and come back with a black box\nequivalent solution using only five. It was a fraction of the cost and far\nmore reliable.\n\nScientists put great store in black box equivalence because of\na principle called Occam’s Razor. William of Occam was an English\nFranciscan friar living in the fourteenth century. He proposed the idea\nof minimal explanation. It states that, ‘among competing hypotheses,\nthe hypothesis with the fewest assumptions should be selected? When\ntrying to explain the workings of a black box, the more complicated\ninner workings should be discarded, as they have no externally verifiable\neffect over the simpler mechanism. Our extraneous animal must be\neliminated! Sorry.\n\nIronically, given his calling, Occam’s Razor is sometimes wheeled\nout as a disproof of the existence of God. Surely God is a complication\nunnecessary to the explanation of our Universe. The argument is\nillustrated beautifully in Carl Sagan’s book Contact and the film of the\nsame name. God gets the last laugh in Sagan’s book when the difficulty\nwith Occam’s Razor is brought into sharp focus. Occam's Razor contains\nan inherent paradox. At any moment in time we only have evidence to\nsupport the simplest of explanations, yet we know many of these simple\nexplanations are incomplete. We regularly discover new phenomenon —\ndark matter and dark energy being some recent examples. If we stopped\ndiscovering new things, Occam's Razor would be a good way to simplify\nour thoughts. Occam’s Razor is a useful intellectual tool to prevent us\nover complicating explanations, but there will often be explanations that\nare correct, but for which there is not yet any observed effect.\n\nIf we go back to our black box example, we see the flaw in concluding\nthe boxes are identical from examining only their inputs and outputs.\nOpening them would clearly show they are not identical! But, how would\nthis fact reveal itself if they remain closed? The answer is: over time. If\nsomething in the box has memory or understanding, it could present\none set of results for a while and a completely different set of results later.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015758",
