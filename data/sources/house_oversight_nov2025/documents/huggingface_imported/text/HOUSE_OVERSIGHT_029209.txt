Sorry again for that last minute cancellation in the Spring -- alas,

the perils of running a new center, that I no longer control my

schedule like in the good old days. But the Obama BRAIN Initiative is
running strong, and MIT has a good bid for a seat at the table, so

that is good. Want to revisit a time for a chat? My schedule is now
much more free, thanks to these BRAIN initiative activities
launching...

Best,
Ed

Good morning Neil...I am afraid Jeffrey must cancel his trip up today...he is sick in bed and not well. Iam so
very sorry to do this last minute. Hopefully we can circle back to this soon.

Thank you,
