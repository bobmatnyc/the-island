  "text": "Federal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\n54035\n\nprosecution of known claims,” not\nclaims that are unknown to the injured\nparty. As to concerns that the statute of\nlimitations could be tolled for years,\n“perhaps indefinitely,” 15> the Board\nresponds that such a potential also\nexists under other statutes, as well as\nunder the NLRA when a charging party\nis unaware of the facts giving rise to an\nalleged unfair labor practice. However,\nat this point, concerns about the\nunfairness of lengthy tolling periods are\nentirely speculative. Tolling is an\nequitable matter, and one factor to be\nconsidered in deciding whether\nequitable tolling is appropriate is\nwhether it would prejudice the\nrespondent. Mercado, above, 410 F.3d at\n48. Accordingly, if a lengthy tolling of\nthe 10(b) period would prejudice an\nemployer in a given case, the Board\ncould properly consider that factor in\ndetermining whether tolling was\nappropriate in that case.156\n\nSeveral comments argue against\ntolling the 10(b) period because\n“ignorance of the law is no excuse.’ 157\nThis argument is amply refuted by the\ncourt decisions cited above, in which\nlimitations periods under other\nworkplace statutes were tolled because\nemployers failed to post required\nnotices. Most notably, the Fifth Circuit\nhas emphasized that the failure to post\na required notice “‘vitiates the normal\nassumption that an employee is aware\nof his rights.”’ Elliot v. Group Med. &\nSurgical Serv., 714 F.2d 556, 563-64\n(5th Cir. 1983). In any event, the maxim\nrelied on is generally understood to\nhave arisen in order to prevent\nindividuals (usually in criminal cases)\nfrom deliberately failing to ascertain\nwhether actions they contemplate taking\nwould be lawful, and then pleading\nignorance when accused of\nlawbreaking.15? In the Board’s view, this\nreasoning loses much of its force when\napplied to individuals, such as charging\nparties in unfair labor practice cases,\nwho are not accused of any wrongdoing\nbut who claim to have been injured by\nthe unlawful actions of other parties.\n\nThe Board emphasizes, however, that\nfailure to post the required notice will\nnot automatically warrant a tolling\nremedy. If an employer proves that an\n\n455 See comments of Fisher & Phillips LLC and\nNational Grocers Association.\n\n156 As to ACC’s concern that the rule could\npotentially subject employers to unfair labor\npractice charges based on conduct as far back as\n1935, the Board stresses that tolling will be\navailable only in the case of unlawful conduct that\noccurs after the rule takes effect.\n\n157 See, e.g., comments of Coalition for a\nDemocratic Workplace and COLLE.\n\n158 Moreover, even in criminal law, the principle\nis not absolute. See, e.g., Lambert v. California, 355\nU.S. 225 (1957).\n\nemployee had actual or constructive\nknowledge of the conduct alleged to be\nunlawful, as well as actual or\nconstructive knowledge that the\nconduct violated the NLRA, and yet\nfailed to timely file an unfair labor\npractice charge, the Board will not toll\nthe 10(b) period merely because of the\nemployer’s failure to post the notice. Cf.\nJohn Morrell & Co., above, 304 NLRB at\n899.\n\nThe Board asked for comments\nconcerning whether unions filing unfair\nlabor practice charges should be deemed\nto have constructive knowledge of the\nunlawful character of the conduct at\nissue. All of the comments that\naddressed this issue answered in the\naffirmative.159 Unlike most employees,\nunions routinely deal with issues\narising under the NLRA and are\ntherefore more familiar with the Act’s\nprovisions. Accordingly, the tolling\nprovisions in the final rule apply only\nto charges filed by employees, not those\nfiled by unions. (The Board still could\ntoll the 10(b) period if a charging party\nunion did not discover the facts\nunderlying the charge within six\nmonths, if the employees reporting\nthose events failed to alert the union\nwithin that time because they were\nexcusably unaware of their NLRA\nrights.)\n\nSeveral comments contend that\nfailure to post the required notice\nshould not toll the 10(b) period if an\nemployee who files an unfair labor\npractice charge is either a union\nmember or is represented by a union.\nTaft Stettinius & Hollister LLP asserts\nthat the burden should be placed\nequally on unions to ensure that their\norganizers and members are aware of\nemployee rights under the NLRA.\nCalifornia Chamber and NCAE observe\nthat knowledge of a filing time limit is\ngenerally imputed to an individual who\nis represented by an attorney, see, e.g.,\nMercado v. Ritz-Carlton San Juan Hotel,\nabove, 410 F.3d at 47-48; they urge that\nan employee who is represented by a\nunion should be treated similarly.\nConversely, three Georgetown\nUniversity law students oppose the idea\nthat union-represented employees\nshould be deemed to have constructive\nknowledge of NLRA rights. They reason\nthat some workplaces may have\nunrepresented as well as represented\nemployees, and that imputing\nknowledge to the latter group would\nprovide an incentive not to post the\nnotice, thus depriving the former group\nof needed information. The students\n\n159 See, e.g., comments of U.S. Chamber of\nCommerce, American Trucking Associations, Taft\nStettinius & Hollister LLP.\n\nalso suggest that some employees,\nthough represented, may have little\ncontact with their unions and rely on\nworkplace notices instead of unions for\nrelevant information.\n\nThe Board finds some merit in both\nsets of contentions. On the one hand, it\nis reasonable to assume that employees\nwho are represented by unions are more\nlikely to be aware of their NLRA rights\nthan unrepresented employees. And,\nalthough being represented by a union\nis not the same as being represented by\nlegal counsel, it is reasonable to assume\nthat union officials are sufficiently\nconversant with the NLRA to be able to\ngive employees effective advice as to\ntheir NLRA rights. On the other hand,\nsome employees, though represented by\nunions, may in fact have little contact\nwith their bargaining representatives for\none reason or other and may, in fact, be\nfiling charges against their\nrepresentative. Thus, the Board does not\nfind it appropriate under all\ncircumstances to impute knowledge of\nNLRA rights to charge-filing employees\nwho are union members or are\nrepresented by unions. Rather, the\nBoard will consider evidence\nconcerning the union’s representational\npresence and activity in determining\nwhether it is appropriate to toll the\n10(b) period.\n\nC. Failure To Post as Evidence of\nUnlawful Motive\n\nThe Board suggested that it could\nconsider an employer’s knowing failure\nto post the notice as evidence of\nunlawful motive in an unfair labor\npractice proceeding in which motive is\nan issue. 75 FR 80414-80415. A number\nof comments assert that the Board\ncannot properly take that step.16° To the\ncontrary, the Board has often considered\nother unlawful conduct as evidence of\nantiunion animus in cases in which\nunlawful motive was an element of an\nunfair labor practice.16 See, e.g., Leiser\nConstruction, LLC, 349 NLRB 413, 417—\n419 (2007) (threats, coercive statements,\ninterrogations evidence of unlawfully\nmotivated failure to hire), enfd. 281 Fed.\nAppx. 781 (10th Cir. 2008)\n(unpublished); Shearer’s Foods, 340\nNLRB 1093, 1094 (2003) (plant closing\nthreat evidence of unlawfully motivated\ndischarge); Ferguson-Williams, Inc., 322\nNLRB 695, 703, 707 (1996) (threats,\ninterrogations, creation of impression of\nsurveillance, evidence of unlawfully\nmotivated discharge); Champion Rivet\nCo., 314 NLRB 1097, 1098 (1994)\n(circulating unlawful antiunion petition,\n\n160 See, e.g., comments of COLLE and California\nChamber.\n161 See comment of AFL-CIO.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_022306",
