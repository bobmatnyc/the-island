You should obtain\nyour own independent tax advice based on your particular circumstances. The information included in this presentation, including, if shown, in the Tax Summary section, does not constitute tax\nadvice, has not been audited, should not be used for tax reporting, and is not a substitute for the applicable tax documents, including your Form 1099, Schedule K-1 for private investments, which we\nwill provide to you annually, or your monthly GS account statement(s).

Information regarding your\nalternative investments and transactions for retirement accounts are not included in the Tax Summary section. Any statement contained in this presentation concerning U.S. tax matters is not\nintended or written to be used and cannot be used for the purpose of avoiding penalties imposed on the relevant taxpayer. Realized and unrealized gains and loss values do not include securities for\nwhich cost basis is unavailable. Losses reflected may be disallowed or deferred by the application of capital loss limitations, wash sale rules or other special tax rules.\n\nAsset Classification. We display holdings and provide market value and performance by asset class. A description of our asset classification schema is available upon request. When you have\nseparately managed accounts, the value of all assets invested in the strategy is displayed in the asset class of the strategy. In those instances, the market value and performance displayed for each\nasset class may also include cash that is not separately reflected under Cash, Deposits and Money Market Funds.\n\nOther Services. Any provided financial planning services, including cash flow analyses based on information you provide, are a hypothetical illustration of mathematical principles and are not a\nprediction or projection of performance of an investment or investment strategy.

Where materials and/or analyses are provided to you, they are based on the assumptions\nstated therein, which are likely to vary substantially from the examples shown if they do not prove to be true. These examples are for illustrative purposes only and do not guarantee that any client will\nor is likely to achieve the results shown. Assumed growth rates are subject to high levels of uncertainty and do not represent actual trading and may not reflect material economic and market factors\nthat may have an impact on actual performance. GS has no obligation to provide updates to these rates.\n\nNot a Municipal Advisor. Except in circumstances where GS expressly agrees otherwise, GS is not acting as a municipal advisor and the opinions or views contained in this presentation are not\nintended to be, and do not constitute, advice, including within the meaning of Section 15B of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.\n\nAdditional Information for Ayco Clients.
