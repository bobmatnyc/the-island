  "text": "priceline.com (PCLN)\n\nOur price objective is $1,920 based on 22x our 2018 adj. EPS estimate. The 22x\nmultiple is towards the upper end of Priceline’s historical multiple range of 13-23x and\nrepresents a PEG of 1.4x. We think a 22x forward P/E multiple is appropriate given mid-\nteens EPS growth, strong booking trends, Priceline’s leadership position in the global\nonline travel sector, track record of EPS upside, and increased access to the China\nmarket via the Ctrip investment.\n\nRisks to our PO are 1) a global economic downturn, especially macro-weakness in\nEurope, leading to fewer travel bookings and pressure on room rates, 2) competition for\ntraffic lowering the company's growth or margin opportunity, 3) hotels favoring their\nown distribution channels, 4) FX volatility, 5) increased competition from Expedia,\nTripAdvisor and potentially Google, and 6} the impact of terrorism/disease on global\ntravel trends. The stock has been subject to heavy volatility in the past based on travel\nindustry trends and this volatility could increase due to greater economic uncertainty,\nespecially with macro-trends in Europe.\n\nQuotient Technology Inc (QUOT)\n\nOur $13 price objective is based on a 16x 2018E EBITDA, a premium to eCommerce\npeers (11x}, which we think is justified given stickiness of the Retailer |Q platform and\nthe slightly higher growth of 14% in FY17 vs. eCommerce group at 11%). Quotient is a\nlead operator in online couponing, has a strong technological platform, relationships\nwith CPGs and a platform that is slowly spreading across grocers in the U.S.\n\nDownside risks are: 1} further delays in point-of-sale system rollout with retailers, 2)\nloss of major retailers or CPG, 3) higher-than-expected R&D and S&M costs due to\ninvestment, and 4) limited float may contribute to volatility.\n\nUpside risks to our analysis are: 1) additional retailers launching on their point-of-sale\nsystem, 2) quicker-than-expected transition to digital couponing, 3) new additional\ndigital coupon retail clients (such as Walmart). and 4) targeted couponing lifting average\ntransaction pricing.\n\nSnap (SNAP)\n\nOur $25 PO is based on our DCF model as we do not expect the company to be\nprofitable until mid- to late-2019 and any earnings-based valuation exercise would\nrequire discounting back future earnings. Our DCF assumes approximately $28bn\nrevenue by 2027 based on 525mn DAUs and $50+ in ARPU. Our PO implies 15.5x EV /\nRevenue, above the peer group at 4x, as we believe Snap's early stage of ad\nmonetization and potential future leverage in the business model warrants a premium\nvaluation multiple to the social media group.\n\nUpside risks to our PO are: 1) greater than expected reacceleration in North America\nDAU growth, 2) more rapid monetization of existing user base with increased ad load\nand/or new ad formats, and 3) better traction and monetization in International markets.\n\nDownside risks to our PO are: 1) further deceleration in user growth that would raise\nconcerns on long-term revenue opportunity, 2) pressure on usage due to competing\nservices, and 3) performance into the first lock-up expiration on 7/29/17.\n\nTripAdvisor (TRIP)\n\nOur price objective of $40 is based on 25x our 2018 non-GAAP EPS estimate. This\nmultiple represents a modest premium to the group for possibly depressed margins and\nre-accelerating top-line growth.\n\nDownside risks to our price objective are: 1) increasing competition (e.g. Yelp), 2) macro-\neconomic factors (e.g. recession in Europe) impacting the travel industry, 3) challenges\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 57\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014943",
