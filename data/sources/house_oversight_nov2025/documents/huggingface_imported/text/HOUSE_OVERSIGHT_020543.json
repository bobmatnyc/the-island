In 2009, the Global Times (48k\nAY#R), part of the People’s Daily group, started an English-language newspaper as well.\n\nChinese investment in the US media market is not limited to the central government.\nChinese provincial media firms also have a footprint in the United States. Sky Link TV\n(K Fi) is one example. It is fully owned by Guangzhou Media American Co, Ltd.\n(2B RSA IRAs), which, in turn, is owned by GZ Television Media (7 N#WMERA\nBR4S]), a Chinese state-owned media outlet. Sky Link’s story also illustrates the switch\nfrom Taiwan money to mainland money in the US Chinese-language media world. Sky\nLink was established in 1989 by a Taiwanese corporation. In 2009, it was purchased by\na private Chinese company; three years later, the Chinese state-owned GZ Television\nMedia bought Sky Link TV, a takeover that was hailed by the PRC’s Ministry of\nCommerce as a key “cultural export” in 2014.'* When Sky Link TV reports on China,\nthe Sino-US relationship, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other important issues concerning\nChina, it follows and quite often repeats verbatim the official line from PRC media. Its\n\nmajor business partners include CCTV and Xinhua.\n\nThe Grand Overseas Propaganda Campaign has continued under the regime of General\nSecretary Xi Jinping, who, in his 2014 New Year’s address, called on all media friendly\nto the CCP to “better tell China’s story.” In March 2018, the Party announced plans\n\nto unite these individual efforts into a mammoth overseas-facing propaganda organ,\nknown as the Voice of China, by merging the foreign operations of China Global\nTelevision Network, China National Radio and China Radio International.” (It is not\n\nclear whether the parallel with the Voice of America was intentional.)\n\nDespite all of these efforts, President Xi still appears to be unsatisfied with the Party’s\nefforts to “grab the right to speak.” In August 2018, the Chinese government announced\na shake-up in its propaganda organs, reflecting significant concern at the heart of the\n\nParty that China was not winning its ideological battle with the West.”°\n\nDiaspora Media\n\nIn the early 1990s, the state-owned China News Service and the Overseas Chinese Office of\nthe State Council dispatched editorial personnel to the United States to found the Chinese-\nlanguage TV broadcaster, SinoVision, and the newspaper Qiaobao (448). Shanghai's\nXinmin Wanbao sent staff to the United States to start up an American edition as\nwell. Chinese officials backed this push as part of an effort to fight back against the\nnegative publicity generated by the Party’s crackdown on protests around Tiananmen\n\nSquare on June 4, 1989,\n\nMedia\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_020543",
