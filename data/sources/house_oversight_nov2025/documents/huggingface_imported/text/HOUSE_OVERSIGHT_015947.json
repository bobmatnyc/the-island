People appear creative — painting,\ncomposing, sculpting and so forth. But, are these endeavors creative\nin the mathematical sense. To prove this, ironically we need to find\nsomething outside mathematics that is definitely non-computable. This\nis tricky. Most artistic things are fuzzily defined and there are no written\nrules we can apply. How can we prove a work of art could not have been\ngenerated by a computer?\n\nTrivial proofs exist but they are rather contrived. For example, it\nwould not be possible to make a film with a solution to the still unproven\nRiemann Hypothesis on the blackboard in the background of a movie\nscene. All the mathematics Good Will Hunting had been already\ndiscovered before the movie was made. New mathematics cannot be\naccidentally generated by a set designer — unless, of course, they also\nhappened to be a world class mathematician.\n\nThese trivial proofs might lead a mathematician to argue the theory\nis proven. There are some artworks which cannot be computed. QED. But\nthese are not very satisfactory proofs. I could create almost any movie I\nwanted without tripping over this rule. What I really wanted to know is\nwhether Good Will Hunting as a whole could have been generated by a\ncomputer. Not that some weird version with a particular mathematical\nproof on the blackboard is forbidden. Movies are a difficult subject for\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_015947",
