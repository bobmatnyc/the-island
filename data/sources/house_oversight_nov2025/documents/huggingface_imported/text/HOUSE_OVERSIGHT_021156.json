I would later find out that\nshe was the daughter of the late prominent businessman and disgraced\nnewspaper tycoon, Robert Maxwell. I told her my name is Jenna pointing\nto my nametag on my shirt and offered her a cold or hot beverage, as\nthose were my instructed duties at work. She accepted a tea and went on\nto chat a bit about this rich guy that she worked for and she knew off-\nhand that he was looking for a massage therapist. Just doing me a good\ndeed out of her kindness of her heart, 1’m sure, she offered to introduce\nme to him. I declined her first proposition, thinking out loud, told her I\ndidn’t know the body well enough to even attempt an interview. She\ndidn’t seem worried at all by my fear of incompetence saying that if he\nliked me enough he would get me the best training in the industry.\nGhislane thought I had a cheery persona and fit the quota for what he was\nlooking for and as she put it an enthusiastic learner that she said she\ngathered from the sticky notes popping out of the various sections in my\nbook. | accepted her phone number and the house address and told her I\nwill call her if | am able to come over after work. I rushed over to the\ntennis courts where my dad was working and told him of the news. We\nboth thought this could be a wonderful opportunity to get my\naccreditation in massage therapy. Seeing that it was a lady in her late\nthirties who came off as more of a nurturer rather than a procurer, neither\nof us saw any reason to be hesitant.\n\nChapter 4\n\nAt around Five p.m. my dad drove me down to the bottom of “El Brillo\nWay.” on the Palm Beach intercostal. We pulled into a short driveway\nbeckoning a large pink mansion with heavy wooden doors. I was so\nexcited about this chance and asked my dad to wish me luck. He gave me\na big squeeze and wished me the best. He walked me to the front door\nand I rung the door chime. Moments later we were greeted by an older\ngentleman dressed in a casual butler uniform. I told him 1 was here to\nmeet Ms. Maxwell for a massage trial and he opened the doors for my\nfather and I telling us to wait in the entry as Ms. Maxwell would be on\nher way any second, and she was. Down the stairs she walked with a\nwarm smile, her short black hair seeming very proper and elegant, for\nnow. She shook my fathers hand and thanked him for bringing me and\nkissed us both on the cheeks. They spoke briefly about whom she worked\nfor and about Mar-a-Lago where we worked. She was in hurry, you could\ntell to end the conversation and say good-bye to my dad, which she did so\n\n23\n\n(1 Copyright Protected Material\nCONFIDENTIAL GIUFFRE004156\n\never pleasantly. She said the boss was upstairs and waiting my arrival, so\nwith that I said bye to my dad and began to follow Ghislane up the stairs.\nI was so nervous, but I didn’t show it. I kept my reserve and demeanor\ncool as ice, trying show maturity for the open position. We continued on\nto the massage room, passing by a grand crystal chandelier, and a couple\nlengthy wooden hall tables displaying a multitude of photos displaying\nyoung girls and beautiful women, trying not to gawk at them I didn’t\neven notice that some of those girls were only wearing their smile.\n\nGhislane asked me how my day at work was and I told her it was easy\npeasy as always just trying to make simple conversation. There was a\nfork at the end of the staircase and she led me to the right hand side. The\nlights were dimmed in the bedroom but I could still see the King Size bed\nin the middle of room, we did a U-turn around the bed, which led us into\na massage room. Dripping in luxury I could’ve definitely compared it to\nthe renowned Mar-a-Lago’s spa’s, it had marble walls and a glass\nenclosed shower and self-automated steam room at the very end of the\nBurberry carpeted room. There was a large mirror over a basin to the\nright of the room with an array of oils, ointments, soaps, and lotions anda\nsmall closed door, which I assumed must be a closet. The only thing that\nstruck awkward about this room was the naked man laying face down\natop of the turquoise massage table in the center of it. “I had to be\nprepared for this,” I told myself. Massage was something | had never\ndone before so I quickly brushed away my thoughts of possible schemes,\nwanting to believe whole-hearted this was going to be legit. Ghislane\nintroduced us to each other and | proceeded to make his acquaintance.\n\nLooking up at from his downwards position, he looked me over and\ngave a smile to Ghislane, an obvious notion of his approval. He was\nJeffrey Epstein as she pronounced for him, as if | supposed to recognize\nhis name or something. He affirmed, “It was his pleasure” and replied to\njust call him Jeffrey, “No need for formalities” he answered, cleverly\nputting me at ease. This man did not look like someone to beware of.\nBoth him and Ghislane appeared to be very nice people and conscious of\ntheir health as their need for massages and spa visits, no alarm bells went\noff, yet. I was prepped by Ghislane to “treat this as a lesson from her and\nfollow her exact lead, if] did good tonight then maybe I would become\nJeffrey’s Travelling Masseuse, seeing the world and getting paid well for\nit’. I was very hopeful, a job like this could really make my dreams come\ntrue.\n\nI followed suit and washed my hands with warm water so the coldness\nwould not shock Jeffery’s naked body, then lathered them in rich bady\nbutter. Ghislane told me to always keep one hand on Jeffrey, even when\ngetting more lotion, so it didn’t make him lose concentration on being\nrelaxed. She gave me a tip and told me to keep a blob of lotion high up on\n\n24\n\nO Copyright Protected Material\n\nGIUFFRLO04 157\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_021156",
