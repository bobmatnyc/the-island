For Apollo, we see that nearly the entire the increase\nin value in the upside case is driven by the expansion of the FRE\nmultiple from 15x to 22.5x.\n\n2018 Impact: Upside case impact is +13% vs. current price on\naverage and 3.8x multiple expansion to a fully taxed EPS. In our\nupside case scenario, we assume a 22.5x multiple on fee-related earn-\nings in our SOTP. We see favorable risk/reward skew APO.\n\nExhibit 7:\nWe see the greatest contribution of fee-related earnings at ARES and\n\nAPO as a percentage of pre-tax earnings\n2018e Pre-Tax Earnings Contribution\n\nulnvestment Income = Performance Fees\n\n100%\n90%\n80%\n70%\n60%\n50%\n40%\n30%\n20%\n10%\n\n0%\n\nmCore Fee Related Earnings\n\n29%\n\n399\n\nARES APO\n\nBX OAK KKR\nSource: Company Documents, Morgan Stanley Research estimates\nNote; Fee Related earnings are on MSe Core methodology, ARES Core FRE include BDC Part 1 Manage-\nment fees that are typically excluded from MSe Core FRE definition\n\nCG Avg.\n\nNORTH AMERICA INSIGHT ~~\n\nDownside case impact assumes no multiple expansion of any kind,\nand that the stocks trade at their same current P/E, however on\nlower, fully taxed EPS. This represents -18% average downside from\ncurrent prices. While this is likely an unreasonable outcome this is\nthe concern among some investors, given that the only certainty in\nthe analysis is a higher tax drag and lower earnings. We see less favor-\nable upside/downside skew for BX and KKR.\n\nExhibit 8:\nOn average we see potential for 3.7x turns of multiple expansion on in\nour upside case with fully taxed EPS at a 24% effective rate.
