  "text": "¢ StubHub trends as StubHub GMV comps are tough in 1H’17 (32% y/y growth in\n1H’16).\n\n« Marketing expenses are expected to increase, putting pressure on margins and\ncould raise concerns that GMV growth is being “bought”.\n\nEarly 1Q traffic data points mixed\n\ncomScore’s eBay desktop unique visitors decreased 6% on average through February vs.\ndown 2% in 4Q. comScore’s total eBay mobile and PC minutes declined 20% y/y on\naverage through February in 1Q vs. down 17% y/y in 4Q. comScore indicates mobile\nminutes decreased 38% vs. down 20% in 4Q.\n\nEstimates vs. Consensus: Expect modest EPS upside\n\nWe expect eBay to report broadly in-line revenue/EPS estimates of $2.21bn/S$0.49 vs.\nthe Street at $2.21bn/S0.48 (guidance is $2.17bn-$2.21bn and $0.46-S0.48). Our model\nassumes 11mn shares repurchased in 1Q (about $350mn of repurchase activity). We\nhave adjusted our GAAP EPS for higher amortization of deferred tax asset.\n\nTable 12: eBay Earnings Summary\n\n1Q17 2017 2017 2018\nRevenue\nBofAML est. $2,210 $2,340 $9,458 $10,062\nGrowth Y/Y% 3% 5% 5% 6%\nStreet $2,206 $2,315 $9,398 $9,925\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nEBITDA\nBofAML est. $855 $843 $3,520 $3,735\nStreet $841 $827 $3,494 $3,726\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\nEPS\nBofAML est. $0.49 $0.48 $2.03 $2.22\nStreet $0.48 $0.47 $2.01 $2.21\nBofAML vs. Street Above Above Above Above\n\nSource: BofA Merrill Lynch Global Research estimates, Bloomberg, as of 4/4/2017\n\nOur $38 price objective is based on 17x our 2018E non-GAAP EPS. O ur 17x P/E\nmultiple is slightly ahead of the retail comp group average of about 16x, reflecting\neBay's potential for a Marketplace growth acceleration (to well above average retail\ngrowth) in 2017. With 6-8% growth and an 8% FCF yield, we think eBay remains an\ninteresting value stock for retail investors, although GARP focused Internet investors\nmay prefer stronger growth at Google or Priceline.\n\n; ; BankofAmerica <2”\n18 Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April 2017 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014904",
