[jeevacation@gmail.com]\nSubject: Re:\n\nAttachments: EPSTEIN.docx\n\nImportance: — High\nperhaps i misunderstood \"let's concentrate on you\"\nJamaica is bad enough but i have mastered that—at least the danger—4th highest murder rate in the world\n\nas for the US i have alienated large stretches of it—i will spare you the details\n\ni was amused that you are now friends with JD Watson\n\nhe single-handedly prevented me from getting a Junior Fellowship at Harvard\n\nIn 1972 I got my PhD in Biology and it was conventional to nominate the very best post-docs for a Junior\nFellowship, Harvard’s most prestigious award—it provided three years of research support without any duties. I\nwas the best student out of Evolutionary and Organismic Biology in more than 20 years. The entire department\n\nwas behind me.\n\nbut Watson was on the 3-man committee, in charge of all the science candidates and he deemed my two papers,\nreciprocal altruism and parental investment and sexual selection as “not being science” and dismissed me in one\nsentence. Well bless his soul, he now does not even understand his own subject—yes, 1 speak of genetics—\nbecause having remained resolutely ignorant of evolutionary logic and biology he can neither understand the\n\nshape and form of the genotype nor how it differs systematically within life\n\ni have been preparing something for you for a long time on human intelligence, Africa, parasites etc because 1\n\nprefer to get things right but i am ready to send you what i have\n\nmain focus is—Africans stupid or smart?\n\nbob\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_025140",
