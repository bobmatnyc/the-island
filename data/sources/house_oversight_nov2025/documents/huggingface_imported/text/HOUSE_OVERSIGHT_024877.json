Best known for its portfolio of adult use edible brands, which includes Spot,\nJourneyman and Mr. Moxey’s Mints, Botanica recently launched a CBD only line of Mr\nMoxey’s Mints, following the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. The products are currently\noffered in the U.S. and the U.K. and are available in one package format consisting of 60\nmints at 5 mgs per CBD each. In the U.S., the mints retail for ~$40 per tin and going\nforward, the company will look to come to market with smaller / lower priced offerings\nto help drive immediate point of sale consumption across brick and mortar retail\nlocations. Over time, management forecasts that ~40% of sales will come from e-\ncommerce, with the balance coming distribution.\n\nGenCanna. Based in Kentucky, GenCanna is a cultivator of premium hemp-derived\nCBD. Additionally, the company offers whole-plant hemp extracts in the form of full\nspectrum or isolated crystalline cannabinoid CBD for wholesale, available to customers\nin the form of powders and oils and can be prepared as a proprietary water dispersible\npowder to support large scale manufacturing needs. Their powders have a CBD\nconcentration of 99.5%+, which is isolated using CO2 extraction and crystal precipitation\n(as is their bulk oil). GenCanna also offers a full range of packaged goods including\nbottled oil drops, capsules and topical creams. All GenCanna products are produced in\nan FDA registered and inspected, food-grade, GMP-compliant facility and are tested by\nthird parties for safety and quality. In November 2018, MariMed (MRMD, not covered)\ninvested $30 mm in GenCanna, which established a long-term supply agreement\nwhereby GenCanna became MariMed’s global hemp CBD supplier.\n\nHighline Wellness.

According to the\ncompany, this provides for competitive pricing relative to their peers (which we would\nclassify as broadly mainstream).
