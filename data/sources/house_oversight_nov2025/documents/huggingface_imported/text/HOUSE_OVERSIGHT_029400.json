  "text": "New Firepower in Shocking Suit Against Trump | Law.com Page 3 of 3\n\nIt looked more to me like the secret handiwork of a lawyer intent on smearing Trump.\n\nIf so, however, there was no way to hold anyone accountable. The phone number provided was\ndisconnected and Johnson’s address was an abandoned, foreclosed house.\n\nThe allegations in the latest complaint by “Jane Doe” are the same, albeit with fewer lurid details and\nno explanation why she is no longer Katie Johnson. But the biggest difference is that she’s got\nlawyers now.\n\nIn addition to Mason, “Jane Doe” is represented—improbably—by New Jersey patent litigator\nThomas Meagher, the managing partner of nine-lawyer IP boutique Meagher Emanuel Laks Goldberg\n& Liao.\n\nMason and Meagher did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nCampaign finance records show that Mason gave $2,000 to Hillary Clinton in February. Meagher\nduring this election cycle has donated to Marco Rubio, Chris Christie, Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush. He has\nnever given money to a Democrat, according to Open Secrets data.\n\nSo is the suit for real? Or is it an especially dirty way to attack Donald Trump?\n\nThere’s a You Tube video of the plaintiff, with her faced blurred and her voice distorted, where she\nrecounts the rape. Under these conditions, it’s impossible to tell if she’s credible or not.\n\nThe complaint also includes an affidavit from “Joan Doe,” a school friend who said the plaintiff told\nher about the rapes in 1994, and from “Tiffany Doe,” who said she recruited the plaintiff to come to\nEpstein’s parties and witnessed the sexual assaults. So perhaps more evidence will emerge to bolster\nJane Doe’s claims.\n\nOn the other hand, if the complaint is determined to be without merit, Mason and Meagher could be\nsanctioned by the court for filing a frivolous lawsuit.\n\nOr Trump could respond like Alan Dershowitz, who was also accused of sexual misconduct with a\nminor in connection with Epstein. The Harvard Law School professor said lawyers for the accuser\nacted unethically and fabricated the allegations; in turn, they sued him for defamation. The case\nsettled earlier this year on undisclosed terms.\n\nIn the Trump case, U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams set an initial conference for Dec. 16. The real\nquestion: if Clinton wins, will this case simply disappear?\n\nJenna Greene can be reached at jgreene@alm.com. On Twitter: @JgreeneJenna\n\n© Copyright 2016. ALM Media Properties, LLC.
