Syria and Iraq shifted policies in the late 1950s and\nby the mid-1960s had been armed by the Soviets. This made Turkey's\nposition precarious: If the Soviets pressed from the north while Syria\nand Iraq pressed from the south, the outcome would be uncertain, to\nsay the least, and the global balance of power was at stake.\n\nThe United States used Iran to divert Iraq's attention. Israel was\nequally useful in diverting Syria's attention. So long as Israel\nthreatened Syria from the south, it could not divert its forces to the\nnorth. That helped secure Turkey at a relatively low cost in aid and\nrisk. By aligning itself with the interests of a great power, Israel lost\nsome of its room for maneuver: For example, in 1973, it was limited\nby the United States in what it could do to Egypt. But those\nlimitations aside, it remained autonomous internally and generally\nfree to pursue its strategic interests.\n\nThe end of hostilities with Egypt, guaranteed by the Sinai buffer\nzone, created a new era for Israel. Egypt was restored to its traditional\nposition, Jordan was a marginal power on the east bank, Lebanon was\nin its normal, unstable mode, and only Syria was a threat. However, it\nwas a threat that Israel could easily deal with. Syria by itself could\nnot threaten the survival of Israel.\n\nFollowing Camp David (an ironic name), Israel was in its Davidic\nmodel, in a somewhat modified sense. Its survival was not at stake.\nIts problems — the domination of a large, hostile population and\nmanaging events in the northern Levant — were subcritical (meaning\nthat, though these were not easy tasks, they did not represent\nfundamental threats to national survival, so long as Israel retained\nnational unity). When unified, Israel has never been threatened by its\nneighbors. Geography dictates against it.\n\nIsrael's danger will come only if a great power seeks to dominate the\nMediterranean Basin or to occupy the region between Afghanistan\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031873",
