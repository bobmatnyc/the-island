  "text": "28\n\nof those lucky people who look better—or at least not worse—with\nage.\n\nAll of this is relevant politically because it means that in 2016, when\nshe’s 68, she is unlikely to be written off as too old to run for\npresident. Since the beginning of the year, Hillary has said repeatedly\nthat she will leave office no later than early 2013 and retire from\npublic life. In Bahrain, just before the Middle East upheaval, I heard\nher be more direct than ever before on the subject: “I’ve had a\nfascinating and rewarding public career .... I think I will serve as\nsecretary of state as my last public position and then I’Il probably go\nback to advocacy work, particularly on behalf of women and\nchildren, and probably around the world.”\n\nHillary isn’t as calculating as her public image. The 2000 Senate race,\nfor instance, was practically serendipitous. But it’s hard to believe\n“Clinton” and “ambition” have been fully sundered. In 2016, the\nDemocrats are unlikely to have anyone better or more acceptable to\ndifferent parts of the party. The nearer-term options are far-fetched.\nWhen Bob Woodward said on CNN last fall that Hillary’s switching\njobs with Joe Biden was “on the table,” the reaction inside both the\nWhite House and State Department was to scoff. Neither has an\nincentive to switch. With the Iraq portfolio already in his pocket,\nBiden gets plenty of foreign-policy action. His bigger concern is\nstaying on good terms with Hillary. In late 2009, he worried that their\nlong and friendly relationship was in jeopardy over Af-Pak policy. He\nwanted few troops and heavy reliance on Predator drones; she wanted\nan open-ended, hugely expensive counter-insurgency commitment.\nThe president ended up sending many more troops than Biden wanted—\na total commitment of 100,000—but with withdrawal deadlines\nbeginning this year that Clinton, siding with the Pentagon, opposed.\nTo ease the tensions, Biden and Hillary stepped up their breakfasts\nand lunches where they call each other “dear.”\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024985",
