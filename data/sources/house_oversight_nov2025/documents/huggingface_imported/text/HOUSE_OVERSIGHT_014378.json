  "text": "Price objective basis & risk\n\nAllianceBernstein (AB)\n\nOur $25 price objective is based on 13x target P/E on our '17E, a discount vs our target\nfor asset managers as a group, based on improving but inconsistent flows and limited\nactive equity exposure as well as the MLP structure which means less liquidity, though a\nhigh distribution. Upside/downside risks to our price objective are market\nappreciation/depreciation, similar to other asset managers, underperformance, and an\nunpredictable yield since it is based on earnings rather than fixed. Because Alliance is an\nMLP, total potential return includes a variable distribution based on earnings.\n\nAmer Express (AXP)\n\nOur $74 price objective reflects a 13x PE multiple to our 2017 EPS estimate. Given the\nelevated uncertainty, we expect AXP will trade near the low end of its historical\nvaluation range, which averages 12x-16x. This multiple reflects our view of solid loan\ngrowth and better billings, offset by increased risks of rising credit and marketing costs.\nWe think the market will view AXP through a more credit card lens in the near-term,\nwhich also supports a multiple at the low end of the historical range.\n\nUpside risks to our PO are stronger than expected macroeconomic conditions,\naccelerating consumer and business spending, lack of disruptions in capital markets, or a\ndecreasing regulatory burden. Downside potential could come from weaker than\nexpected macroeconomic conditions and renewed recessionary pressure, softer\nconsumer and business spending, disruptions in capital markets, or an increasing\nregulatory burden.\n\nAres Management (ARES)\n\nOur price objective (PO) for Ares is $18, which implies a target price-to-ENI (P/ENI or\nP/E) multiple of 11x our 2017 ENI estimate. Our price objective is based on our sum-of-\nthe-parts (SOTP) analysis. Our SOTP analysis includes the following components: a\ntarget multiple on fee related earnings (15x - in line with or a premium to asset\nmanager multiples given healthy growth and sticky assets), book value for the balance\nsheet investments and accrued carry, and a discounted value on the performance fee\nupside over a cycle (1.3x MOIC). Based on this method, we value the fee related\nearnings at $13/unit, the balance sheet (principal investments and accrued carry) at\n$4/unit, and the discounted value of future carry income and investment income at\n$1/unit, which equates to a total value of $18.\n\nRisks to our PO: a weak macro and capital markets backdrop, potential changes in tax\nlaws related to carried interest and partnerships, legal and political risk, increased\nregulation, credit market disruptions, poor performance, weak fundraising, expansion\nrisk, key person and talent risk, competition, a unique corporate structure that limits\nunitholder control, and lock ups.\n\nAssociated Banc-Corp (ASB)\n\nWe use an equal weighted three-factor valuation framework (P/E, P/TBV, DCF) to arrive\nat our $20 price objective and assign a 1.4x multiple to 3Q17E TBV and a 14.9x 2017\nP/E multiple, in-line with smid-cap peers due to their near median return profile. Our\nDCF assumes a two-stage cost of capital of 10% and a terminal growth rate of 5%. The\nupside risk to our price objective is a less onerous residential RE cycle. Downside risks\nare a double dip in housing prices, deteriorating energy portfolio and falling rental\nincome for commercial properties.\n\nBanc of California (BANC)\n\nTo arrive at our $15.50 price objective, we have employed a three-factor valuation\nmethodology that incorporates target P/E, target P/TBV and a DCF model. For our P/E\nanalysis, we use a 14x earnings multiple on BANC’'s 2017E core earnings below peer\n\nBankofAmerica <2”\n\n64 2016 Future of Financials Conference | 17 November 2016 Merrill Lynch\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014378",
