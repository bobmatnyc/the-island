How the Oslo Accords became gripping drama

As Tony award-
winning play ‘Oslo’
comes to the NT,
Con Coughlin shares
his memories of
covering the actual
events it depicts
three-hour play
about the Middle
East peace process?
It’s hardly a subject
to get the pulse
racing. And yet,
JT Rogers’s new

play Oslo, about

the astonishing,
behind-the-scenes negotiations that
resulted in the historic Oslo Accords
in 1993, won a Tony for Best Play on
Broadway this year, and has already
virtually sold out its month-long run
at the National. Such is the demand
that the production, starring Toby
Stephens, promptly transfers to the
West End in October.

Oslo dramatises a period of history
-anda brief spell of optimism - that
is now a distant memory. With so
much of the modern-day Middle East
consumed by turmoil and conflict, it’s
al-Qaeda, so-called Islamic State, Iraq,
Syria and Libya that are dominating
the headlines, not the peace process.

Even as we approach the
100th anniversary of the Balfour
Declaration, whereby Britain
commnitted itself to the establishment
of a Jewish homeland in the
uncultivated area of the eastern
Mediterranean known as Palestine,
the long-running conflict between
the Israelis and the Palestinians is no
longer the main story. So much so
that theatregoers in New York were
heard to remark after a performance
of Oslo, “Oh, the PLO! I’d forgotten all
about them.”

Yet by taking the art of diplomacy

as its subject, Rogers has fashioned an

unexpected thriller out of the brave
and inspired Palestinian and Israeli
negotiators who came together in

a remote Norwegian house to put
aside decades of hostility and make
peace. Their efforts were rewarded
with a momentous ceremony on the
White House lawn in September
1993, with Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli
prime minister, and Yasser Arafat,
the PLO chairman, shaking hands

to seal the deal in front of a beaming
president Bill Clinton. And sitting
anonymously among the thousands
of global dignitaries who had flocked
to Washington to witness this historic
event was Terje Red-Larsen, the
cultivated, softly spoken Norwegian
diplomat who, with his wife Mona
Juul, made it all possible by enabling
the rival delegations to meet in secret
to thrash out their differences.

As a journalist covering these
extraordinary events for The Daily
Telegraph during the Nineties, I came
to know a number of these players
personally. Many of them are no
longer around to reflect on Rogers’s
version of events. Rabin, the great
Israeli warrior-turned-politician who
agreed to make peace with Arafat,
aman most Israelis, as one Israeli

character in the play remarks, saw as
being akin to “Hitler in his bunker”,
was murdered by a Jewish extremist
in November 1995 in revenge for
signing the deal. The mysterious
circumstances surrounding Arafat’s
death in a Paris hospital in November
