I had reserved the\napproach of pushing non-website URLs for a few months because you expressed concern with making sure\nour URLs are on first page... but I had call w/ Mr. Epstein in the beginning of January and expressed that is a\nlimiting factor for moving Forbes/NYPost as quickly as we'd like.\n\nGetting up different types of results for different folks is required to dislodge the negative placements. Once\nthey are dislodged it is much easier to restore our websites back to the rankings and have our \"ideal\" first\npage. The reason for this is Google tracks click data on results and as soon as Forbes/NYPost are on second\npage they will begin a slow death (less clicks on those, more clicks on the ones we have on first page)\n\nFrom there we will see our properties shoot up due to the interlinking between them and the reinforcement we\ncan provide from sites like Harvard, Nat Geo, and any other publications we have influence over. Using the\n\"short-term\" links is one battle around other pages is just a part of the overall war... You saw how Google was\nchanging up much more dramatically when we had multiple Epstein's on the first page vs. having a saturated\nfirst page.\n\nI feel like time was lost focusing on making sure it was Mr. Epstein properties when he has giving explicit\npermission to promote any URL required to dislodge the negatives.\n\nI hope this makes sense.. I haven't heard from Rich on the last invoice I sent (1/29/14) and am hoping all is\nwell. Do you know if he's out of the office ?\n\nOn Fri, Feb 7, 2014 at 10:18 AM, Christina Galbraith i wrote:\n\nHi Tyler,\nIm at a Kinko's.\n\n| see that you're boosting non-website url's -- are you sure this is the right approach? (vs. boosting Jeffrey's sites?) the\n.org and foundation sites are slipping down and the USVI and science are permanently off the first page.\n\nThanks for you input.\n\nChristina\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_029547",
