  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n765\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\ntain general jurisdiction over them, all\nclaims asserted against those individual\ndefendants are dismissed for lack of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\n\n3. Plaintiffs Are Entitled to Jurisdic-\ntional Discovery as to Privatbank’s\nInvesting Activities in the United\nStates\n\n[37] Plaintiffs point out that Privat-\nbank’s website and its 2001 Annual Report\nstate that Privatbank engages in transac-\ntions involving securities issued in the\nUnited States. (2001 Annual Report at 3,\nattached to Affidavit of Frances E. Bivens\nat Exhibit B). There is no allegation that\ntransactions are related to the claims as-\nserted here. Accordingly, they are only\nrelevant to this Court’s determination of\nwhether the exercise of general jurisdic-\ntion over Privatbank is warranted pursu-\nant to Rule 4(k)(@) for having such “con-\ntinuous and systematic general business\ncontacts” with the United States. See\nAerogroup Intl, Inc., 956 F.Supp. at 489.\n\nBecause plaintiffs have identified a gen-\nuine issue of jurisdictional fact, the ques-\ntion of general jurisdiction cannot be re-\nsolved on the pleadings and affidavits\nalone. Thus, plaintiffs are entitled to ju-\nrisdictional discovery regarding the extent\nof defendant Privatbank’s general business\ncontacts with the United States in the\nyears 1992—1998, a period that includes\nthe relevant period in this action and five\npreceding years. See In re Magnetic Au-\ndiotape Antitrust Litig., 334 F.3d at 207-\n08; see also, Metropolitan Life Ins. Co., 84\nF.3d at 569-70 (holding that the time peri-\nod relevant for determining extent of a\ndefendant’s contacts for general jurisdic-\ntion purpose should include a number of\nyears prior to the events giving rise to the\nclaims asserted).\n\nIV. CONCLUSION\n\nFor the reasons set forth above, the\nSovereign defendants’ motion to dismiss is\n\ngranted in part and denied in part. Plain-\ntiffs’ claims alleging takings in violation of\ninternational law, promissory estoppel, eq-\nuitable estoppel, and unjust enrichment—\ncounts seven, nine, and ten in the com-\nplaint—are hereby dismissed as against\nthe Sovereign defendants. In addition, the\nmotion of individual defendants Horath\nand Buchmann to dismiss the complaint\nfor lack of personal jurisdiction is granted\nand all claims asserted against those de-\nfendants are hereby dismissed.\n\nBecause this Court finds that an issue of\njurisdictional fact exists as to the existence\nof general jurisdiction pursuant to Rule\n4(k)(2) as to corporate defendant Privat-\nbank, its motion to dismiss is denied with-\nout prejudice to its renewal pending con-\nclusion of jurisdictional discovery on that\nissue,\n\n© & KEY NUMBER SYSTEM\n\n40oms\n\nIn re: TERRORIST ATTACKS ON\nSEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\nBurnett v.
