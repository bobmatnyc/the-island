  "text": "4.2.12\nWC: 191694\n\nto establish a causal connection between porn and rape. Here is the definition as set out in a\nmodel statute introduced in several state legislatures by radical feminists:\n\nPornography is the graphic sexually explicit subordination of women, whether in pictures\nor in words, that also include one or more of the following: (1) women are presented\ndehumanized as sexual objects, things or commodities; or (11) women are presented as\nsexual objects who enjoy pain or humiliation; or (ili) women are presented as sexual\nobjects who experience sexual pleasure in being raped; or (iv) women are presented as\nsexual objects tied up or cut up or mutilated or bruised or physically hurt; or (v) women\nare presented in postures of sexual submission, servility or display; or (vi) women’s body\nparts—including but not limited to vaginas, breast and buttocks—are exhibited, such that\nwomen are reduced to those parts; or (vii) women are presented as whores by nature; or\n(vili) women are presented as, or penetrated by, objects or animals; or (ix) women are\npresented in scenarios of degradation, injury, torture, shown as filthy or inferior, bleeding,\nbruised or hurt in a context that makes these conditions sexual. (emphasis added).\n\n99 ce\n\nThe italicized words—“subordination,” “dehumanized,” “objects,” “scenarios of\ndegradation”—are so vague and subjective that they could apply to the writings of Shakespeare,\nCheckov, Roth, Hemingway, Mailer, DeSade, Miller and many others. The only element this new\ndefinition of pornography has in common with what Justice Stewart “knew” when he “saw” it is\nthe requirement that the material be “sexually explicit.” Without this element, the government\nwould have no historical basis for banning speech. I then went on to show that there was no\ncorrelation (to say nothing of causation) between the sexual explicitness of a film and the\nlikelihood that it will induce violence by its viewer. Indeed the available evidence suggests that\nthere may well be a negative correlation, since rape has gone down considerably in those societies\nin which sexually explicit films are pervasive, while rape has certainly not gone down in those\nsocieties that persist in censoring films with explicit sex.\n\nI argued therefore that “pornography is a red herring” and that in the absence of compelling\nevidence—of which there is none—that it causes actual harm beyond offending those who can\nchoose not to see it, the government should get out of the business of censoring films and other\nmedia.\n\nThere are, however, other types of speech that pose far greater potential dangers. These\ncommunications include the divulgence of state secrets, the dissemination of classified information\nand the publication of news stories that compromise the national interest and endanger citizens.\nThe problem is that the censorship of such expression may also pose far greater risks to\ndemocracy and liberty than the censorship of obscenity. Put another way, democracy could\nsurvive the censorship of hard-core pornography, despite the “slippery slope” from “porn” to\npolitics (or from Harry Reems to Helen Hayes.) A society that banned pornography would,\nperhaps, be less vibrant, less tolerant, less pluralistic, less committed to choice, than one that did\nnot. It might also be more subject to sliding down the slope toward other forms of artistic\ncensorship at the margins. But so long as core political discourse remained free and open—as\nlong as political dissent continued to thrive—democracy could survive. The same could not\nconfidently be said about the widespread censorship of expression regarded by the government as\nstate secrets, classified information and “dangerous” news stories. These go to the very heart of\n\nL17\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017204",
