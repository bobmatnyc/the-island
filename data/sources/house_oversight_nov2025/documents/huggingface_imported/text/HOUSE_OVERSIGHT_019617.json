  "text": "The Great Divide | 129\n\nmillion classified documents at the Signals Intelligence Center in\nHawaii, and flying to Russia.\n\nAdditional information does not necessarily change the minds of\npeople who already have a firm view. In the field of social psychol-\nogy, the testing of “confirmation theory” consistently shows that\npeople tend to more readily reject new information that contradicts\ntheir pre-existing beliefs. For example, when Lee Harvey Oswald\nwas arrested in the Texas Theater on November 22, 1963, he said\nfamously, “I haven’t shot anybody.” Ten months later, the Warren\nCommission presented evidence, including ballistic tests, that it\nclaimed showed that Oswald had shot three people, including Presi-\ndent John F. Kennedy, less than an hour before making his statement.\nYet many of those who believed Oswald’s public proclamation of\nhis innocence chose to believe that the government had falsified\nall the incriminating evidence to tarnish Oswald (who had been\nkilled on November 24, 1963) rather than accept that they had\nbeen wrong in believing Oswald.\n\nThe charges, countercharges, and defamatory name-calling in the\n\n© Snowden case therefore only deepened the great divide. Those who ©\nsaw Snowden as a democratic hero exposing the abuses of power of\nan out-of-control national security state tended to dismiss anything\nthat depicted Snowden in a negative light as a fabrication, while\nthose who saw Snowden as a “traitor” tended to dismiss anything\nthat depicted him in a more positive light.\n\nWhen it comes to the murky universe of spy agencies, the prob-\nlem in deciding where the truth lies is further heightened by the\npossibility of deliberate deception. Spy masters are, after all, in the\nbusiness of concealing their most sensitive operations. It is often\nconsidered essential that important secrets be protected by what\nWinston Churchill famously termed “a bodyguard of lies.” Top\nintelligence officials are not exempt from this practice. Consider, for\nexample, the response to a question concerning the NSA‘s opera-\ntions made by James Clapper, the director of national intelligence, to\nthe Senate Intelligence Committee on March 12, 2013. The Demo-\ncratic senator Ron Wyden of Oregon, who was on the committee,\nasked the spymaster if the NSA collected data on Americans.
