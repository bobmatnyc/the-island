  "text": "334 Are the Androids Dreaming Yet?\n\nThis is quite a complex piece of mathematics so let me show you how\nit works. Again, our thought experiment relies on an analogy involving\nclothing — sorry.\n\nIn the Bell Test experiment three polarizers are set up at 0, % and %\nof the way around a circle, 120 degrees apart. For Einstein to be correct\nphotons must each carry at least three pieces of information:\n\nIf I meet the 0 degree polarizer do I go through or not?\nIf I meet the 120 degree polarizer do I go through or not?\nIf I meet the 240 degree polarizer do I go through or not?\n\nIf a photon had only one piece of information, say that it was\nvertically polarized, it would not know what to do if it came across a\npolarizer at 45 degrees. In that case the photon would sometimes go\nthrough and sometimes not, with a fifty-fifty probability. But Einstein\ndid not want to countenance probability. “God does not play dice with\nthe Universe.” He required certainty. “I like to think the Moon is there\nwhen I am not watching it” The photons must know enough to handle,\nwith certainty, any eventuality they may come across. (We could set up\nexperiments with a more complex set of choices, dividing the photons\n\ninto quarters, fifths and so on, but thirds are simple numbers and we can\nuse the children’s clothing analogy to demonstrate the mathematics.)\n\nz2z2<<<< EF\n;\nZz<=<22<< GE)\n\nz<<2<22<\nHHoouoo ow F-\nwonooHnoak\n\n°\n\nHats, Scarves, and Gloves\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_016024",
