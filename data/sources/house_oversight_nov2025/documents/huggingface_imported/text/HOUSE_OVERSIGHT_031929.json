It\nmay be only a matter of time before Assad falls, but we simply do not\nknow how long it will take and how it will unfold.\n\nExternal intervention and support for anti-government forces is\nundoubtedly the most important issue that separates the Libyan case\nfrom the Syrian one. Slaughtered by Qaddafi’s regime, Libyan\nprotesters did not hesitate to ask for Western military intervention,\nwhich they ultimately got in the form of a NATO aerial campaign.\nLet’s be honest and clear, without NATO’s air strikes, the no-fly\nzone, and the sanctions against Qaddafi, the civil war in Libya would\nhave dragged on even longer, and rebel victory would have been\nextremely difficult if not impossible to achieve.\n\nThe majority of the protesters in Syria do not want Western military\nintervention. Their position is both courageous and rational, but it is\nnot without costs and risks. With external military assistance (if the\nWest sends arms or launches another NATO aerial campaign), they\nwould be in a better position operationally to overthrow Assad, but\ntheir ability to govern their country in the future autonomously would\nbe more limited (surely nothing is for free in international relations).\nWithout external military assistance, they are extremely vulnerable\nand at the mercy of Assad’s tanks and security forces, but if they pull\nhis overthrow off, they will own their country’s future and put\nthemselves in a position to better ward off future foreign meddling\nand interference. It is not an easy choice, but so far, the Syrian\nprotesters have decided to go it alone, and one must understand and\nrespect their remarkable position.\n\nWhile the balance of forces currently tilts heavily in Assad’s favor,\nQaddafi’s downfall might just be the necessary factor that will\nembolden the protesters and offer them a sizeable advantage. This is\nnot naive or farfetched. After all, it was the plight of Tunisian vendor\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_031929",
