It had not been acceptable to the\nRabbis, nor would it be to justices and judges.\n\nEven at Yale, my chutzpah was not welcome by all the professors. Professor Fritz Kessler, was\nan older European trained academic who taught jurisprudence. One day, he was lecturing on\nFreud’s influence on German jurisprudence and he misunderstood one of Freud’s most important\ntheories. I raised my hand and corrected him. After class, an older student, who had been a\nMarine and was married to another student in our class, grabbed me and said, “You embarrassed\nsomeone I love. If you ever do that again, I’ll deck you.” I was startled and replied, “How did I\nembarrass your wife?” He said, “Not my wife, stupid. Professor Kessler, you embarrassed him.\nDon’t ever correct him again publicly.” So much for academic freedom. But Professor Bickel\nwas wise to caution me about toning down my aggressiveness if I wanted to succeed as a law\nclerk.\n\nGuido Calabresi offered similar cautionary advice, but it was more about style than substance. He\nreally pushed hard to get Justice Black to select me.\n\nProfessor Rodel was so concerned that I might contaminate the elderly Justice Black that he took\nthe train to Washington to try to persuade him to reject the recommendation of his recent law\nclerk. In the end, Justice Black told Professor Calabresi that he had to defer to his friend's veto\nfor that year but that he would consider me for the following year. This was the best possible\nnews because it allowed me to accept a clerkship with Judge David Bazelon on the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\n\nJudge Bazelon was actually my first choice, but I also wanted--indeed I felt I needed--the status\nthat came along with a Supreme Court clerkship in order to obtain the kind of job offers I would\nbe seeking after finishing my clerkships. Two of my other mentors at law school, Professor\nJoseph Goldstein and Professor Abraham Goldstein (not related) had both clerked for Judge\nBazelon. One of my primary interests in law school was the relationship between law and\npsychiatry. Another was criminal law. Those were also Judge Bazelon's specialties. Making the\nBazelon clerkship even more appealing was the likely upcoming vacancy that would be left when\nJustice Frankfurter, who had suffered a stroke, retired. Bazelon was on the short list to fill the so-\ncalled \"Jewish seat\" on the Supreme Court. So if Judge Bazelon were to be promoted to the\nSupreme Court, he might take his law clerk with him.\n\nIn the end, Judge Bazelon was regarded as too liberal for the Kennedy Administration and was\npassed over for labor secretary Arthur Goldberg, who had no judicial experience, but boasted a\ndistinguished career as a labor lawyer before he joined the Cabinet as Secretary of Labor.\nBazelon and Goldberg were close friends, both having grown up in the Jewish neighborhoods of\nChicago and being the same age. I ended up clerking for both Judge Bazelon and for Justice\nGoldberg, which was a dream come true. I spent two years in Washington from the summer of\n1962 to the summer of 1964. These were extremely eventful years, not only for me, but for the\ncountry and the world. The Cuban Missile Crisis took place several months into my clerkship\nwith Judge Bazelon. Martin Luther King's \"I have a dream\" speech was delivered in the summer\nof 1963. And in the fall of 1963, early in my Supreme Court clerkship, President Kennedy was\n\n47\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017134",
