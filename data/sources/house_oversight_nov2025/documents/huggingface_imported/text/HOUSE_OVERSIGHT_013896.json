It’s safer.\n\nI personally aim for an 8—/0x markup, which means a $100 product can’t cost me more than $10—\n\n12.50.24 If I had used the commonly recommended 5 x markup with BrainQUICKEN, it would have\ngone bankrupt within 6 months due to a dishonest supplier and late magazine. The profit margin saved it,\nand within 12 months it was generating up to $80,000 per month.\n\nHigh has its limits, however. If the per-unit price is above a certain point, prospects need to speak to\nsomeone on the phone before they are comfortable enough to make the purchase. This is contraindicated\non our low-information diet.\n\nI have found that a price range of $50—-200 per sale provides the most profit for the least customer\nservice hassle. Price high and then justify.\n\nIt Should Take No More Than 3 to 4 Weeks to Manufacture.\n\nThis is critically important for keeping costs low and adapting to sales demand without stockpiling\nproduct in advance. I will not pursue any product that takes more than three to four weeks to\nmanufacture, and I recommend aiming for one to two weeks from order placement to shippable product.\n\nHow do you know how long something takes to manufacture?\n\nContact contract manufacturers who specialize in the type of products you’re considering:\nhttp://www.thomasnet.com/. Call a related manufacturer (e.g., toilet bowls) if you need a referral to a\nrelated manufacturer you cannot find (e.g., toilet cleaning solutions). Still no luck? Google different\nsynonyms for your product in combination with “organization” and “association” to contact the\nappropriate industry organizations. Ask them for referrals to contract manufacturers and for the names of\ntheir trade magazines, which often contain advertisements for contract manufacturers and related service\nproviders we’ll need for your virtual architecture later. Request pricing from the contract manufacturers\nto ensure the proper markup is possible. Determine the per-unit costs of production for 100, 500, 1,000,\nand 5,000 units.\n\nIt Should Be Fully Explainable in a Good Online FAQ.\nHere is where I really screwed up in my product choice with Brain-QUICKEN.\n\nEven though ingestibles have enabled my NR life, I would not wish them on anyone. Why not? You\nget 1,000 questions from every customer: Can I eat bananas with your product? Will it make me fart\nduring dinner? On and on, ad nauseam. Choose a product that you can fully explain in a good online\nFAQ. If not, the task of travelling and otherwise forgetting about work becomes very difficult or you end\nup spending a fortune on call center operators.\n\nUnderstanding these criteria, a question remains: “How does one obtain a good muse product that\nsatisfies them?” There are three options we’ll cover in ascending order of recommendation.\n\nOption One: Resell a Product\n\nP orechasine an existing product at wholesale and reselling it is the easiest route but also the least\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_013896",
