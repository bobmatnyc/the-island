  "text": "76 CASSELL ET AL. [Vol. 104\n\ninvokes the CVRA’s definition of crime “victim,” its legislative intent, and\nits structure, a closer reading of each demonstrates little support for the\nnotion that crime victims must await the formal filing of charges before\naccruing CVRA rights.\n\nA. OLC’S MISREADING OF THE CVRA’S DEFINITION OF “VICTIM”\n\nOLC’s lead argument is that the CVRA’s definition of “victim”\npresupposes that criminal charges have been formally filed.8* The CVRA\ndefines a “victim” who is protected as “a person directly and proximately\nharmed as a result of the commission of a Federal offense.”** Focusing on\nthe word “offense,” OLC concedes that it does not “conclusively resolve”\nthe question of when rights attach. Nevertheless, OLC claims that the word\n“naturally suggests that a person’s status as a ‘crime victim’ can only be\ndetermined after there has been a formal decision to charge a defendant\nwith a particular Federal offense.”*? OLC goes on to elaborate:\n\nUnder this reading, the earliest that a “crime victim” under the Act could be identified\nwould be upon the filing of a criminal complaint—that is, at the earliest point at which\nthere is a sworn written statement of probable cause to believe that a particular\ndefendant committed an identified Federal offense and hence the first point at which it\nis possible with any certainty to identify a “crime victim” directly and proximately\nharmed by the commission of that offense.*°\nOLC is disingenuous in asserting that the “first point” at which a\nperson has been harmed by a federal crime arises only after a criminal\ncomplaint has been filed. The Department routinely makes such\ndeterminations at earlier points in criminal cases, such as when it sends a\n“target letter” to a defense attorney during a grand jury investigation.*’\nIndeed, OLC remarkably ignores the fact that the Department is directly\nrequired to identify victims of a crime before the filing of a criminal\ncomplaint, both by statute and through internal policy directives.\nThe Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA)*® requires\nthe Department to identify victims before the filing of a criminal complaint.\n\n83 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 6.\n\n84 18 U.S.C. § 3771(e) (2012) (emphasis added).\n\n85 OLC CVRA Rights Memo, supra note 2, at 5.\n\n8° Td.\n\n87 A target letter explains the procedural process underlying an indictment and places the\ndefendant on notice of the general nature of the government’s criminal investigation.

L. No. 101-647, 104 Stat. 4820 (codified as amended at 42 U.S.C. §§ 10601,\n10606-07 (2006)).\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014055",
