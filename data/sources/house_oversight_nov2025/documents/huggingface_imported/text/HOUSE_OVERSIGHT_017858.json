  "text": "IN RE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001\n\n793\n\nCite as 349 F.Supp.2d 765 (S.D.N.Y. 2005)\n\nThe commercial character of an activity\nshall be determined by reference to the\nnature of the course of conduct or particu-\nlar transaction or act, rather than by refer-\nence to its purpose.” 28 U.S.C. § 1608(d).\nThe Supreme Court has explained, “when\na foreign government acts, not as a regu-\nlator of the market, but in the manner of a\nprivate player within it, the foreign sover-\neign’s actions are ‘commercial’ within the\nmeaning of the FSIA.” Weltover, 504 U.S.\nat 614, 112 S.Ct. 2160. Courts must in-\nquire whether the foreign state’s actions\n“are the type of actions by which a private\nparty engages in trade and traffic or com-\nmerce.” Jd. (internal citations omitted).\n\n[15] Judge Robertson determined that\nthe commercial activity exception did not\napply to the Burnett Plaintiffs’ claims\nagainst Prince Sultan and Prince Turki\nbecause “the act of contributing to a foun-\ndation is not within our ordinary under-\nstanding of ‘trade and traffic or commerce’\nnor, apparently was it within the contem-\nplation of ... Congress.” Burnett I, 292\nF.Supp.2d at 18 (citing H.R.Rep. No. 94-\n1487, at 16, reprinted wm 1976\nU.S.C.C.A.N. at 6615). Thus, the consoli-\ndated Plaintiffs do not assert that the com-\nmercial activities exception is applicable to\nany of the Defendants raising FSIA de-\nfenses here. This Court adopts Judge\nRobertson’s reasoning. To the extent any\nPlaintiffs’ claims are based on a Defen-\ndant’s contributions to charities, those acts\ncannot be considered commercial.\n\n[16,17] The Federal Plaintiffs allege\nthat the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, Prince\nSultan, and Prince Turki financed terror-\nism by contributing to or supporting chari-\nties known to support terrorist activities.\nIn these Plaintiffs’ view, this is essentially\nmoney laundering and, therefore, a com-\nmercial activity. See, eg., Federal Plain-\ntiffs’ Opp. to Motion to Dismiss of Prince\nSultan at 18 (citing U.S. v. Goodwin, 141\n\nF.3d 394, 399 (2d Cir.1997)). The Second\nCircuit noted in Goodwin that “[mloney\nlaundering is a quintessential economic ac-\ntivity,’ 141 F.3d at 399, but that statement\nhas no bearing here. In Goodwin the\ncourt was not deciding whether money\nlaundering is a commercial activity for\npurposes of the FSIA. /d. (analyzing con-\nstitutionality of criminal money laundering\nstatute). The Second Circuit has made\nvery clear that, for purposes of the FSIA,\na commercial activity must be one in which\na private person can engage lawfully.\nLetelier v. Republic of Chile, 748 F.2d 790,\n797-98 (2d Cir.1984); see also Saudi Ara-\nbia v. Nelson, 507 U.S. 349, 360-62, 113\nS.Ct. 1471, 123 L.Ed.2d 47 (1993) (holding\ndetaining and torturing plaintiff is not\ncommercial activity since it “is not the sort\nof action by which private parties can en-\ngage in commerce”). Since money laun-\ndering is an illegal activity, see 18 U.S.C.\n§ 1956 (criminalizing money laundering), it\ncannot be the basis for applicability of the\ncommercial activities exception. See Lete-\nher, 748 F.2d at 798 (holding alleged par-\nticipation in an assassination is not a lawful\nactivity and therefore not a commercial\nactivity for purposes of the FSIA). Ac-\ncordingly, the Court finds that the com-\nmercial activities exception outlined in\n§ 1605(a)(2) is inapplicable to the allega-\ntions contained in the Federal complaint\nagainst the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,\nPrince Sultan, and Prince Turki.\n\n2. State Sponsor of Terrorism\n\n[18] Subsection (a)(7) lifts immunity in\ncases:\nin which money damages are sought\nagainst a foreign state for personal inju-\nry or death that was caused by an act of\ntorture, extrajudicial killing, aircraft\nsabotage, hostage taking, or the provi-\nsion of material support or resources\n... for such an act ... except that the\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017858",
