One enjoys a stable regulatory environment and solid\npower purchase agreements, as in Hong Kong and Thailand; the other is a victim of government\nintervention, as in Korea and China. The two worlds can coexist in the same country, for example in\nMalaysia where independent power producers enjoy solid power purchase agreements while utility\nTenaga, which is a large employer and which faces the consumer directly, suffers from political meddling.\nCapex cycles and potential regulatory changes, respectively, tend to dominate performance of the two\nsides. For example, Korea Electric Power has outperformed sharply at times in the past on even small\nsteps toward fuel cost passthrough implementation. In India’s chaotic power markets, outperformance\ncould arise from even small steps toward implementation of urgently-needed reform, e.g. any movement\nto improve access to fuel supply (notably coal) for independent power producers. The dichotomy\nbetween the two “worlds” of the Asian utility sector provides ample opportunities to generate alpha.\n\nThe vast population and developing nature of the region, and consequent issues of energy security and\nenvironmental sustainability, create additional forces for structural change. For example, as China\nincreasingly promotes natural gas usage, we will see gradual pricing reform, more natural gas imports,\n\ngreater natural gas vehicle adoption and accelerating shale gas development.\n\nBelow is a partial list of structural changes driving long/short opportunities in Asia-Pacific (ex-Japan):\n\n10 Electron Capital Partners, LLC\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_024211",
