Jeffrey Epstein is a billionaire financier, philanthropist, and sex offender. In 2005, Epstein\nbecame the subject of an undercover sex trafficking investigation by Palm Beach, Florida\npolice and the FBI. Dozens of underage women were trafficked by Epstein to perform sexual\nacts on him as well as his friends.\n7. Despite the gravity of his offenses, the Department of Justice allowed Epstein to plead guilty\nto a single count of soliciting prostitution from a minor under Florida state law, and serve\nonly 13 months in prison. In addition, prosecutors agreed not to bring charges against\nEpstein’s alleged co-conspirators.\n8. Mr. Epstein enjoyed close ties to numerous prominent political figures, including former\nPresident Bill Clinton and Prince Andrew of the British Royal Family, leading many to\nspeculate whether he received preferential treatment from authorities. See Goodnough, Abby,\n“Questions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Florida Sex Case,” The New York Times,\nSep. 3, 2006. (Exhibit A)\nFOIA Request and Constructive Denial\n9.

They monitored the comings and goings\nof its owner’s private jet, subpoenaed his phone records and riffled through his\ntrash.\nThe owner was Jeffrey Epstein, 53, an intensely private New York money\nmanager with several billionaire clients. Months earlier, the stepmother of a 14­yearold\ngirl told the Palm Beach police that a wealthy older man, whom the girl later\nidentified as Mr. Epstein, might have had inappropriate sexual contact with her.\nIn sworn statements to the police, the 14­year­old and other teenage girls said a\nfriend had arranged for them to visit Mr. Epstein’s home and give him massages,\nusually in their underwear, in exchange for cash.\nMost of the girls, according to the police, said Mr. Epstein had masturbated\nduring the massages, and a few said he had penetrated them with his fingers or\npenis. They identified him in photos and accurately described the inside of his home.\nSome recalled that his employees had fed them snacks or rented them cars.\nCase 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1-1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 2 of 5\nMr. Epstein pleaded not guilty in August to the crime he was ultimately charged\nwith, soliciting prostitution. But at a time when prosecutors around the nation have\nbecome increasingly severe in dealing with people accused of sex offenses, the case\nhas raised questions about whether Mr. Epstein’s prominence won him preferential\ntreatment.\nBy the account of the police, they found probable cause to charge Mr. Epstein\nwith much more serious offenses: one count of lewd and lascivious molestation and\nfour counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor.\nBut instead of proceeding with such charges on his own, the Palm Beach County\nstate attorney took the rare step of presenting a broad range of possible charges to a\ngrand jury, which indicted Mr. Epstein in July on the lesser count. In Florida,\nprosecutors usually refer only capital cases to grand juries.\nEven before the indictment, the Palm Beach police chief, Michael Reiter, had\naccused prosecutors of giving Mr. Epstein special treatment and asked the state\nattorney, Barry E. Krischer, to remove himself from the case.\nIn an editorial, The Palm Beach Post attacked Mr. Krischer, a Democrat whose\npost is elective, saying the public had been left “to wonder whether the system tilted\nin favor of a wealthy, well­connected alleged perpetrator and against very young girls\nwho are alleged victims of sex crimes.”\nThe case has taken a toll on the reputation of Mr. Epstein, who owns a palatial\nhome in Manhattan, has pledged $30 million to Harvard and once flew former\nPresident Bill Clinton on his 727. Politicians including Eliot Spitzer, a Democratic\ncandidate for governor in New York, and Gov. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, also a\nDemocrat, have returned campaign contributions from him.\nBut Mr. Epstein fought back, assembling a team of star lawyers, including\nGerald B. Lefcourt and Alan M. Dershowitz, a friend of his, to look into the\nbackgrounds of his young accusers.\nMr. Lefcourt says that the police acted “outrageously” and that his client has\nbeen wrongfully dragged through the mud.\nCase 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1-1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 3 of 5\n“He disputes that he ever had sex with any under­age person or anything like\nthat,” said Mr. Lefcourt, whose clients have included Russell Crowe, Martha Stewart\nand Abbie Hoffman.\nNeither the police nor the state attorney’s office would discuss the case in detail.\nBut the police released a thick report on the 13­month investigation after the\nindictment was unsealed in late July.\nThe police started investigating Mr. Epstein in March 2005, almost immediately\nafter they were contacted by the stepmother of the 14­year­old, who, according to the\nreport, was in a special school for students with disciplinary problems.\nThe girl, the report said, told the police that an older friend had “offered her an\nopportunity to make money” and had driven her to Mr. Epstein’s house one Sunday.\nThe friend, identified by the police as Haley Robson, a local community college\nstudent, told the girl to say she was 18 if Mr. Epstein asked, the report said.\nThe girl told the police that Mr. Epstein’s assistant had led her upstairs to a\nroom with a massage table and that Mr. Epstein had come in and told her to remove\nher clothes. She said Mr. Epstein had masturbated as she massaged him, had\npressed a vibrator against her underwear and had given her $300 afterward.\nIn October, the police interviewed Ms. Robson, then 19, who told them Mr.\nEpstein had routinely paid her to bring teenage girls to his home. The police then\ninterviewed a total of 5 alleged victims and 17 witnesses, many of whom told similar\nstories about what they had observed or participated in at Mr. Epstein’s home.\nAccording to the report, at least one said Mr. Epstein had engaged in intercourse\nwith her.\nMr. Lefcourt, his lawyer, said one girl who told the police of having had sex with\nMr. Epstein as a minor had lied about both the sex and her age and had not shown\nup for grand jury questioning. He also said Mr. Epstein had passed a lie­detector test\nclearing him of any sexual involvement with under­age girls.\nA spokeswoman for the Palm Beach police said that early this year, the police\nwent to Mr. Krischer, the state attorney, intending to apply for warrants to arrest\nCase 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1-1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 4 of 5\nMr. Epstein. Instead, she said, they were told that Mr. Krischer would convene a\ngrand jury to examine the evidence and decide what charges, if any, to bring.\nAround that time, the police report said, Mr. Dershowitz met with prosecutors\nto share information about the accusers, including statements they had posted on\nMySpace.com, the social networking site, concerning use of drugs and alcohol.\nAccording to the report, Mr. Krischer’s office then decided to delay the grand jury\nsession for several months.\nThe Palm Beach police grew frustrated, the report said, and on May 1 the\ndepartment asked prosecutors to approve warrants to arrest Mr. Epstein.\nChief Reiter also wrote Mr. Krischer questioning “the unusual course that your\noffice’s handling of this matter has taken” and suggesting that Mr. Krischer\ndisqualify himself. Chief Reiter refused several requests to be interviewed, and his\nspokeswoman would not say explicitly why he had urged the prosecutor to step\naside.\nMike Edmondson, a spokesman for Mr. Krischer, said the state attorney’s office\nsometimes sent noncapital cases to grand juries when there were questions about\nwitness credibility. Mr. Krischer does not recommend a particular charge in such\ncases, Mr. Edmondson said, but gives the grand jury a list of possible charges.\nBruce J. Winick, a law professor at the University of Miami, said that while\nprosecutors in Florida rarely referred noncapital cases to grand juries, they\nsometimes did so with sensitive cases to be extra­cautious.\nMr. Lefcourt said the police were wrong to have released the report so soon,\nespecially without correcting information that later proved wrong. He cited his\nassertion that one accuser had lied about her age, adding that she had also been\narrested on drug charges and had been fired by her employer for stealing.\n“What I’m trying to focus on,” Mr. Lefcourt said, “is, What’s motivating the\nselective and misleading release of information to the public?”\nA version of this article appears in print on , on Page A19 of the New York edition with the headline:\nQuestions of Preferential Treatment Are Raised in Florida Sex Case.\nCase 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1-1 Filed 05/25/17 Page 5 of 5\n© 2017 The New York Times Company\nCase 1:17-cv-03956-PGG Document 1-2 Filed 05/25/17 Page 1 of 3\nVIA FOIA PORTAL\nApril 20, 2017\nTO:\nFROM:\nFederal Bureau of Investigation\nJames Robertson\nSenior Managing Editor\nThe National Enquirer\n4 New York Plaza (2 nd Floor)\nNew York, NY 10004\n(212) 743-6555\nDear Sir or Madam,\nI am a reporter and editor for The National Enquirer.
