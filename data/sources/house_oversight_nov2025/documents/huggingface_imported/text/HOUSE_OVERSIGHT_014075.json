[Vol. 104\n\nreasonable efforts to notify identified victims of, and consider victims’\nviews about, prospective plea negotiations, even prior to the filing of a\ncharging instrument with the court.”?°°\n\nThe Department also noted that it provided extensive pre-charging\nnotifications to victims under the VRRA:\n\nPursuant to the Victims’ Rights and Restitution Act of 1990 (VRRA), the Department\nidentifies victims and provides to them service referrals, reasonable protection, notice\nconcerning the status of the investigation, and information about the criminal justice\nprocess prior to the filing of any charges. The Department’s investigative agencies\nprovide such services to thousands of victims every year, whether or not the\ninvestigation results in a federal prosecution.?!°\n\nQuantifying the scope of this undertaking with regard to one federal\ninvestigative agency, the Department explained:\n\n[T]he [FBI] alone reports that it provided more than 190,000 services to victims\nduring the past fiscal year [FY 2011], including case status updates, assistance with\ncompensation applications and referrals, and counseling referrals. From sexual\nassaults mi Indian Country to child pornography and human trafficking to mass\nviolence and overseas terrorism, FBI victim specialists provide much-needed\nimmediate and ongoing support and information to victims. The FBI addresses victim\nsafety issues when needed, providing on-scene response and crisis intervention\nservices in thousands of investigations. With regard to sexual assault victims, FBI\npersonnel arrange for and often accompany victims to forensic sexual assault medical\nexaminations and provide assistance with HIV/STD testing.?!!\n\nIn view of the Department’s existing notifications and provision of\nservices before charges are filed under the VRRA, it is hard to conceive\nhow any viable claim could be made that it would be difficult to provide\nsimilar nghts under the CVRA. The four rights that would be potentially in\nplay before charging would be the night to reasonable protection, the nght\nto fair treatment, and the nght to confer with prosecutors, along with the\npredicate right to notice of these rights.”!”_ The VRRA already requires the\nDepartment to provide reasonable protection, so this would not be an\nexpanded obligation.?'> Similarly, the Guidelines already require\nprosecutors to confer with victims about plea agreements (the most\ncommon situation where victims want to confer), so it is hard to imagine\nhow extending this right would create any undue burden.*'* Additionally,\nthe night to “fair treatment” could only be a problem if the Department\n\n209 Td.\n\n710 Td. at 2-3.\n\n211 Td. at 3.\n\n712 18 U.S.C. § 3771 (a)(1), (5), (8), (c)(1) (2012).\n\n713 See 42 U.S.C. § 10607(c\\(2) (2006).\n\n214 See ATTORNEY GENERAL GUIDELINES, supra note 52, at 41-42.\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014075",
