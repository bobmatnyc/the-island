  "text": "humanities project among the list of projects the Dean supports. The money did it: as soon as they\nheard about the gift, they took my project more seriously. Because of that gift, the Faculty of Arts\nand Sciences, which is space-stingy, found and rewired a studio space for me to house my video\nproduction operation and team. That gift woke up the Deans to the importance of Harvard's role in\nproducing the highest quality humanities content for the WORLD, and not just for Harvard students.\nMy main employee has half of her salary paid with these funds, and the foundation of our collection\nfor PBS LearningMedia is being made with this support. This gift represented one of the most\nconsequential shifts of the last year, allowing me create content and launch projects this year that\nmake future projects that much more likely. If | can keep this base sturdy at Harvard, refilling these\ncoffers, | will be that much more able to keep working.\n\n| am also so grateful for the help you gave me in defining my project for Templeton, and, what help\nyou have offered to give in bringing them around. | have, since Templeton turned me down, gotten\nfunding to produce video on two of the poems I'd proposed to Templeton and to create, and test,\nthat video in schools as | proposed. One of my partners in that project is Success Academy, where |\ncould also expand my work with Templeton. And there are still other poems that may satisfy their\ncharacter criteria more fully, including the third of the poems I'd originally proposed and that Joe\nBiden had agreed to discuss with me (on parenthood and humility). At this point, I'm gaining the\nplatform and the name recognition to be an effective spokesperson for the foundation on building\nliteracy and character in the schools.\n\nIt really means a lot to me, all financial help aside, Jeffrey, that you are rooting for me and thinking\nabout me. You push back a lot (as Larry does), and it’s always annoying but | always learn.\n\nWith abundant gratitude,\nLisa\n\nElisa New\n\nPowell M.
