  "text": "of the imagination and heritage, and of the nostalgic dream of restoring the\nIslamic caliphate.\nThe concept of the state\n\nToday’s debate within Hamas over the concept of the state is more\nconcrete than theoretical. The political conditions in the Palestinian\nterritories do not allow for dreaming about unrealistic grand theories being\npromoted by some Islamist movements. Hamas is facing real-world\nproblems that require real-world solutions. The Palestinian state being\nenvisioned by Palestinian, Arab, and world politicians is based on the June\n1967 borders. But does that fit Hamas’s political vision and intellectual\norientation? Generations of Islamists have been raised on the concept of\nthe “Islamic state,” which is synonymous with the Islamic caliphate. But\nHamas’s situation is a little different.

In\nother words, they want Hamas to agree to the two-state solution. And that,\nexplicitly or implicitly, essentially means that Hamas has recognized\nIsrael’s right to exist!
