  "text": "Expedia (Buy, $146 PO)\n\nStock view: 1Q faces tough comps, but should clear way for strength into ‘18\n\nWe think 1Q expectations are somewhat muted as Expedia has highlighted several\nearnings headwinds in early 2017, including incremental cloud migration spend, higher\nmarketing spend and, recently, potential ADR pressure. 1Q’17 earnings will face the\ntoughest room night growth comps, though Expedia expressed optimism on trends\nthrough January on the 4Q call. Comps ease during the rest of the year for Expedia,\nwhich we see as a positive set up for the stock. We think Expedia will reiterate its 10-\n15% EBITDA growth outlook and .Expedia remains our top 2017 summer (2Q/3Q) travel\nidea.\n\nWe currently forecast 20% y/y room night growth in 2Q/3Q, though the comp is\n1600bps easier vs. 1Q and street growth expectations could be higher. The ongoing\nbenefit of conversion rate improvements, the Easter shift into 2Q (noted as 1% impact\nin 2Q’16), as well as the benefit of more aggressive marketing spend should aid 2Q\ngrowth. Additionally, prior to 1Q’17 earnings, Expedia will begin to disclose HomeAway\nonline bookings and room nights, which we think may drive y/y room night growth 200-\n300bps higher (we forecast HomeAway room nights up 50% y/y in 2017 vs. core OTA\nroom nights up 18%). We think investors will also view HomeAway disclosure positively\nif the data indicates that the HomeAway transition remains on track and provide\nvisibility into potential EBITDA acceleration in 2018.\n\nSTR data suggests hotel fundamentals deteriorated modestly in the US through initial\nMarch readings, but improved slightly in Europe through February. However, Expedia’s\nCEO commented in a recent interview with the Financial Times that international\ntourism to the US (Expedia’s key market) has decelerated following the introduction of\nTrump’s travel bans, which may be a downside risk to 1Q bookings and revenues. This\nmirrors ForwardKeys data from early March that after Trump’s executive order, foreign\ntourism bookings to the US fell, then rebounded when the ban was suspended, but\ndeclined again when the ban was re-introduced. A few US hotel operators have\nindicated little impact from travel bans, so data is mixed.\n\nKey theme/metric(s) for 1Q: room night growth vs industry and Priceline\n\nWe expect 1Q organic room night growth to remain steady at 16% y/y, though we note\nthat this does not yet include the contribution from HomeAway, which we think should\nadd 200-300bps to y/y growth. We expect N. America bookings growth of 12% y/y vs.\n8% in 4Q, Int’l bookings (FX-neut.) of 14% y/y.\n\nBiggest 1Q issues/risks:\n« Room nights may disappoint on tougher 1Q comps, negatively impacting the\nacceleration thesis\n\n¢ — Expedia’s CEO commented in a recent interview with the Financia/ Times that\ninternational tourism to the US (Expedia’s key market) has decelerated following\nthe introduction of Trump’s travel bans, which may pressure hotel ADRs and be a\ndownside risk to 1Q bookings\n\n¢ Pace of investments, namely cloud IT spend ($110mn in 2017) and marketing ramp\n\n« HomeAway EBITDA trends given marketing spend ramp and pressure on\nsubscription revenues. Street has high expectations for the business.\n\n¢ Pressure on hotel take rates given agency mix shift and rewards programs\n\nEarly 1Q RevPAR data decelerates\nAccording to STR, 1Q US RevPAR through initial March readings decelerated 30bps to\n3.0% y/y, and European RevPAR through February accelerated 600bps q/q to 3.6% y/y\n\nBankof America\n\nMerrill Lynch Internet/e-Commerce | 06 April2017 19\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_014905",
