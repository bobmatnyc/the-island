  "text": "Early that evening, we were ordered to rejoin Bren’s division to be ready for\nthe crossing. When I reported that three of my soldiers were still missing, I was\nordered to inform the commander of the battalion replacing us to find the\nmissing men. The fight for the Chinese Farm was still not over. It would be\nanother 12 hours before, in a co-ordinated push by a strengthened armor and\ninfantry force, Israeli forces finally drove most of the Egyptians out. What\ntenuous gains we’d made until then had come at an enormous price. Of\nYitzhik’s 300 men, nearly 40 were killed, and many others wounded. I’d led\naround 130 people into battle. More than 35 were injured. Eleven were dead,\nincluding Yishai Izhar and Motti Ben-Dror, our medical officer, killed while\ntreating the wounded. One of our missing soldiers was found alive. The other\ntwo could only be brought home for burial.\n\nAs I began to hear the details of the previous days’ fighting, I became more\nastonished, and angry. Israel’s tactics in the battle for the Chinese Farm had\ninvolved a series of piecemeal strikes by units obviously too small, and\ninadequately supported or co-ordinated, to succeed. The problem wasn’t the\nchoice of units. No one could doubt the record of Battalion 890, or of the men\nArik had sent in before Yitzhik arrived. But there was no way they were going\nto take the area on their own. I couldn’t understand why there wasn’t an attempt\nto assemble a force that might actually have been strong enough: parachutists,\ntanks, artillery. I felt I knew at least part of the answer from the two nights I had\nspent in the Um-Hashiba command post before joining Bren’s division. By\ndawn on October 16, the first of Arik’s men had crossed the canal. By the\nafternoon, although the big roller-bridge was still not ready, a smaller pontoon\nbridge was available. Everyone knew we needed to get control of the Chinese\nFarm. But all the field commanders were focused the real task, and the real\nprize: crossing the canal and defeating the Egyptians on the other side.\n\nNow, at least, the main crossing was underway. Bren had chanced the fact\nthat, with Yitzhik pinned down at the Chinese Farm and the Egyptians\nconcentrating their fire on his men and mine, he could get the pontoon bridge\nthrough. From late afternoon on October 17, his first units began to cross. On\nthe morning of October 18, my battalion joined them. There was still fighting\nahead, and we were part of it: taking out the SAM sites, engaging units of the\nThird Army and, with Sadat now pressing the Americans for a cease-fire and\nmany Egyptian units clearly losing the will to fight on, racing against the clock\nto encircle and defeat it five days later.\n\n155\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_028003",
