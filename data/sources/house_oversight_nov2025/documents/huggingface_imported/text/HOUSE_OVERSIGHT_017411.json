You\nmade us feel safer.”\n\nI had no idea that Rostropovich or any of the other artists or dissidents whose rights we\nadvocated, had ever heard of us, or had any idea of what we were doing on their behalf.\nRostropovich’s hug, and what he said, was more than enough compensation for all the pro-bono\nwork we had done on behalf of dissidents and artists around the world.\n\nI had become involved in the defense of Soviet dissidents after reading Elie Wiesel’s eye-opening\nbook “The Jews of Silence,” which first alerted me to the plight of Soviet Jewish and non-Jewish\ndissidents. I traveled to the Soviet Union and other parts of Eastern Europe on several occasions\nduring the 1970s and 1980s and filed briefs on behalf of dissidents Refusenicks and others. I have\nwritten extensively about this aspect of my human rights work elsewhere” and will not repeat it\nhere. Suffice it to say that my unwillingness to limit my advocacy only to Jewish Refusenicks in\nthe Soviet block caused a rift with some Jewish and Israeli organizations, but I insisted that\nhuman rights must extend to all who are oppressed or discrimination against.\n\nOne of my Soviet clients was Silva Zalmunsen, who after several years of confinement was finally\nreleased from the Soviet Gulag. When she finally came to America, I along with her other\nAmerican lawyers arranged to meet her over lunch at Lou Siegel’s, a kosher restaurant in\nManhattan. It would be our first “reunion” — hopefully the first of many — with the clients we had\nnever met. Our encounter was emotional and tearful. Knowing of Silva’s love for all things\nJewish, we decided to order a real old-fashioned Jewish meal for our Friday lunch. The first dish\nwas cholent, a delicious concoction of beans, potatoes, barley, and a small amount of beef,\ncooked for hours in a savory sauce. When the cholent came, I turned to Silva and explained what\nit was — that it was a traditional dish served in Jewish homes on the Sabbath. She took one taste\nof it, and her face turned sad — and then she burst out laughing as she exclaimed, “Traditional\nJewish food? This is Russian prison food! I’ve just been through eating food like this for four\nyears!” Only then did we realize that the old-fashioned food, which was such a treat for us, was\npeasant food, designed to use the least amount of meat possible. The same economics that\ndictated the diets of our peasant forebears now determined the menus prepared by the prison\nauthorities. We all had a good laugh, and I ordered a slice of rare roast beef for our guest.\n\nI made several trips to the Soviet Union during that time. On one of them I met a young man\nwho had been a dissident and refusenick but who had been drafted into the army because of his\nactivities. He wanted to smuggle a message out in is own voice, using his broken English, to seek\nsupport from human rights organizations throughout the world. Tape recorders were not\npermitted in the Soviet Union at that time and it was illegal to smuggle out tapes. But he had\nmanaged to get his hand on a primitive cassette recorder and he brought me a copy of a\nTchaikovsky tape that was being sold in the Soviet Union. In order to prevent re-recording over\nthe tape, certain changes had been made in the cassette. My Soviet client knew how to override\nthose changes and he managed to record his statement in lieu of the third movement of\nTchaikovsky’s Fifth. He told me that its always good to have the recorded statement in the\n\n°8 [cite Best Defense, Chutzpah, articles]\n\n324\n\nHOUSE_OVERSIGHT_017411",
