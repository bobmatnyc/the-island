  "text": "54018\n\nFederal Register/Vol. 76, No. 168/Tuesday, August 30, 2011/Rules and Regulations\n\nSome comments argue that the\nBoard’s notice posting rule does not go\nfar enough to effectuate the NLRA. One\nlabor attorney argues that the Board\nshould require annual trainings for\nsupervisors and captive audience\nmeetings where employees are read\ntheir rights by supervisors and Board\nagents and the employees would have to\nacknowledge receiving those notices.\nThe same comment suggests banning\ncaptive audience meetings by\nemployers. The comment concludes that\nthe NPRM “‘doesn’t go anywhere near\nfar enough. It is, however, an important\nand worthwhile advancement.” %\nAnother comment also suggests that\nannual, mandatory training classes for\nemployees would be desirable.9° The\nBoard believes that this Rule strikes the\nproper balance in communicating\nnecessary information about the NLRA\nto employees.\n\nFor all the foregoing reasons, the\nBoard is persuaded that many private\nsector employees are unaware of their\nNLRA rights.96\n\nIII. Summary of Final Rule and\nDiscussion of Related Comments\n\nThe Board’s rule, which requires\nemployers subject to the NLRA to post\nnotices of employee rights under the\nNLRA, will be set forth in Chapter 1,\nPart 104 of Volume 29 of the Code of\nFederal Regulations (CFR). Subpart A of\nthe rule sets out definitions; prescribes\nthe size, form, and content of the\nemployee notice; and lists the categories\nof employers that are not covered by the\nrule. Subpart B sets out standards and\n\na few months, especially since the number of\ncontractors covered by the Labor Department’s rule\nis only a small fraction of the number of employers\nsubject to the NLRA. In any event, the Board does\nnot believe that that is the proper criterion by\nwhich to measure the rule’s effectiveness. The\npurpose of requiring the posting of such notices is\nto inform employees of their rights so that they may\nexercise them more effectively, not to obtain any\nparticular result such as the filing of more election\npetitions.\n\nThe same comment also cites a couple of\ntextbooks which it asserts are popularly used in\nhigh schools today to argue that labor history is\nbeing taught to today’s students. The Board is\nunable to assess the truth of that assertion, but\nregardless, it is unclear whether students\nnecessarily connect this history to their future\nrights as employees.\n\n°3Comment of Weinberg, Roger & Rosenfeld.\n\n947d.\n\n°5Comment of Staff Representative, Steelworkers.\n\n°6 Accordingly, the Board finds it unnecessary to\nconduct a study to determine the extent of\nemployees’ knowledge of NLRA rights. The Board\nfurther observes that even if only 10 percent of\nworkers were unaware of those rights, that would\nstill mean that more than 10 million workers lacked\nknowledge of one of their most basic workplace\nrights. The Board believes that there is no question\nthat at least a similar percentage of employees are\nunaware of the rights explained in the notice. In the\nBoard’s view, that justifies issuing the rule.\n\nprocedures related to allegations of\nnoncompliance and enforcement of the\ntule. The discussion below is organized\nin the same manner and explains the\nBoard’s reasoning in adopting the\nstandards and procedures contained in\nthe regulatory text, including the\nBoard’s responses to the comments\nreceived.\n\nSubpart A—Definitions, Requirements\nfor Employee Notice, and Exceptions\nFrom Coverage Definitions\n\nA. The Definitions\n\nFor the most part, the definitions\nproposed in the rule are taken from\nthose appearing in Section 2 of the\nNLRA, 29 U.S.C. 152. No comments\nwere received concerning those\ndefinitions, and they are unchanged in\nthe final rule. A number of comments\nwere received concerning the definition\nof other terms appearing in the rule.\nThose comments are addressed below.\n\nB. Requirements for Employee Notice\n\n1. Content Requirements\n\nThe notice contains a summary of\nemployee rights established under the\nNLRA. As explained above, the Board\nbelieves that requiring notice of\nemployee rights is necessary to carry out\nthe provisions of the NLRA.\nAccordingly, § 104.202 of the proposed\nrule requires employers subject to the\nNLRA to post and maintain the notice\nin conspicuous places, including all\nplaces where notices to employees are\ncustomarily posted, and to take\nreasonable steps to ensure that the\nnotices are not altered, defaced, or\ncovered by any other material, or\notherwise rendered unreadable.\n\nAs stated in the NPRM, the Board\nconsidered the substantive content and\nlevel of detail the notice should contain\nregarding NLRA rights. In arriving at the\ncontent of the notice of employee rights,\nthe Board proposed to adopt the\nlanguage of the Department of Labor’s\nfinal rule requiring Federal contractors\nto post notices of employees’ NLRA\nrights. 29 CFR part 471. In the NPRM,\nthe Board explained that it tentatively\nagreed with the Department of Labor\nthat neither quoting the statement of\nemployee rights contained in Section 7\nof the NLRA nor briefly summarizing\nthose rights in the notice would be\nlikely to effectively inform employees of\ntheir rights. Rather, the language of the\nnotice should include a more detailed\ndescription of employee rights derived\nfrom Board and court decisions\nimplementing those rights. The Board\nalso stated that it saw merit in the\nDepartment of Labor’s judgment that\nincluding in the notice examples, again\n\nderived from Board and court decisions,\nof conduct that violates the NLRA will\nassist employees in understanding their\nrights. 75 FR 80412.\n\nPrior to issuing the NPRM, the Board\ncarefully reviewed the content of the\nnotice required under the Department of\nLabor’s final rule, which was modified\nin response to comments from\nnumerous sources, and tentatively\nconcluded that that notice explains\nemployee rights accurately and\neffectively without going into excessive\nor confusing detail. The Board therefore\nfound it unnecessary, for purposes of\nthe proposed rulemaking, to modify the\nlanguage of the notice in the Department\nof Labor’s final rule. Moreover, the\nBoard reasoned that because the notice\nof employee rights would be the same\nunder the Board’s proposed rule as\nunder the Department of Labor’s rule,\nFederal contractors that have posted the\nDepartment of Labor’s required notice\nwould have complied with the Board’s\nrule and, so long as that notice is\nposted, would not have to post a second\nnotice. Id.\n\nThe proposed notice contained\nexamples of general circumstances that\nconstitute violations of employee rights\nunder the NLRA. Thus, the Board\nproposed a notice that provided\nemployees with more than a\nrudimentary overview of their rights\nunder the NLRA, in a user-friendly\nformat, while simultaneously not\noverwhelming employees with\ninformation that is unnecessary and\ndistracting in the limited format of a\nnotice. As explained below, the Board\nalso tentatively agreed with the\nDepartment of Labor that it is\nunnecessary for the notice to include\nspecifically the right of employees who\nare not union members and who are\ncovered by a contractual union-security\nclause to refuse to pay union dues and\nfees for any purpose other than\ncollective bargaining, contract\nadministration, or grievance adjustment.\nSee Communications Workers v. Beck,\n487 U.S. 735 (1988). Id. at 80412-80413.\n\nThe Board specifically invited\ncomment on the statement of employee\nrights proposed for inclusion in the\nrequired notice to employees. In\nparticular, the Board requested\ncomment on whether the notice\ncontains sufficient information of\nemployee rights under the NLRA;\nwhether it effectively conveys that\ninformation to employees; and whether\nit achieves the desired balance between\nproviding an overview of employee\nrights under the Act and limiting\nunnecessary and distracting\ninformation.
