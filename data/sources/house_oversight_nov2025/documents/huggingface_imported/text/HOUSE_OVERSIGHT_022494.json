The Foreign\nCorrupt Practices Act (FCPA) is a critically important statute for combating corruption around the globe. Corruption has\ncorrosive effects on democratic institutions, undermining public accountability and diverting public resources from important\npriorities such as health, education, and infrastructure. When business is won or lost based on how much a company is\nwilling to pay in bribes rather than on the quality of its products and services, law-abiding companies are placed at a competitive\ndisadvantage—and consumers lose. For these and other reasons, enforcing the FCPA is a continuing priority at the\nDepartment of Justice (DOJ) and the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\nThe Guide is the product of extensive efforts by experts at DOJ and SEC, and has benefited from valuable input from\nthe Departments of Commerce and State. It endeavors to provide helpful information to enterprises of all shapes and sizes—\nfrom small businesses doing their first transactions abroad to multi-national corporations with subsidiaries around the world.\nThe Guide addresses a wide variety of topics, including who and what is covered by the FCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting\nprovisions; the definition of a “foreign official”; what constitute proper and improper gifts, travel and entertainment expenses;\nthe nature of facilitating payments; how successor liability applies in the mergers and acquisitions context; the hallmarks of\nan effective corporate compliance program; and the different types of civil and criminal resolutions available in the FCPA\ncontext. On these and other topics, the Guide takes a multi-faceted approach, setting forth in detail the statutory requirements\nwhile also providing insight into DOJ and SEC enforcement practices through hypotheticals, examples of enforcement\nactions and anonymized declinations, and summaries of applicable case law and DOJ opinion releases.\nThe Guide is an unprecedented undertaking by DOJ and SEC to provide the public with detailed information about\nour FCPA enforcement approach and priorities. We are proud of the many lawyers and staff who worked on this project,\nand hope that it will be a useful reference for companies, individuals, and others interested in our enforcement of the Act.\nLanny A.

In our free market system it is basic that the\nsale of products should take place on the basis of price, quality, and service.\nCorporate bribery is fundamentally destructive of this basic tenet. Corporate\nbribery of foreign officials takes place primarily to assist corporations in gaining\nbusiness. Thus foreign corporate bribery affects the very stability of overseas\nbusiness. Foreign corporate bribes also affect our domestic competitive climate\nwhen domestic firms engage in such practices as a substitute for healthy competition\nfor foreign business. 1 —United States Senate, 1977\n\nchapter 1\nIntroduction\nINTRODUCTION\nCongress enacted the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA or the Act) in\n1977 in response to revelations of widespread bribery of foreign officials by U.S.\ncompanies. The Act was intended to halt those corrupt practices, create a level\nplaying field for honest businesses, and restore public confidence in the integrity\nof the marketplace. 2\nThe FCPA contains both anti-bribery and accounting\nprovisions. The anti-bribery provisions prohibit U.S. persons\nand businesses (domestic concerns), U.S. and foreign\npublic companies listed on stock exchanges in the United\nStates or which are required to file periodic reports with\nthe Securities and Exchange Commission (issuers), and\ncertain foreign persons and businesses acting while in the\nterritory of the United States (territorial jurisdiction) from\nmaking corrupt payments to foreign officials to obtain or\nretain business. The accounting provisions require issuers\nto make and keep accurate books and records and to devise\nand maintain an adequate system of internal accounting\ncontrols. The accounting provisions also prohibit individuals\nand businesses from knowingly falsifying books and\nrecords or knowingly circumventing or failing to implement\na system of internal controls.\nThe Department of Justice (DOJ) and the\nSecurities and Exchange Commission (SEC) share FCPA\nenforcement authority and are committed to fighting foreign\nbribery through robust enforcement. An important\ncomponent of this effort is education, and this resource\nguide, prepared by DOJ and SEC staff, aims to provide\nbusinesses and individuals with information to help them\nabide by the law, detect and prevent FCPA violations, and\nimplement effective compliance programs.\nThe Costs of Corruption\nCorruption is a global problem. In the three decades\nsince Congress enacted the FCPA, the extent of corporate\nbribery has become clearer and its ramifications in a transnational\neconomy starker. Corruption impedes economic\ngrowth by diverting public resources from important priorities\nsuch as health, education, and infrastructure. It\nundermines democratic values and public accountability\nand weakens the rule of law. 3 And it threatens stability and\nsecurity by facilitating criminal activity within and across\n2\nborders, such as the illegal trafficking of people, weapons,\nand drugs. 4 International corruption also undercuts good\ngovernance and impedes U.S. efforts to promote freedom\nand democracy, end poverty, and combat crime and terrorism\nacross the globe. 5\nCorruption is also bad for business. Corruption is\nanti-competitive, leading to distorted prices and disadvantaging\nhonest businesses that do not pay bribes. It increases\nthe cost of doing business globally and inflates the cost of\ngovernment contracts in developing countries. 6 Corruption\nalso introduces significant uncertainty into business transactions:\nContracts secured through bribery may be legally\nunenforceable, and paying bribes on one contract often\nresults in corrupt officials making ever-increasing demands. 7\nBribery has destructive effects within a business as well,\nundermining employee confidence in a company’s management\nand fostering a permissive atmosphere for other kinds\nof corporate misconduct, such as employee self-dealing,\nembezzlement, 8 financial fraud, 9 and anti-competitive\nbehavior. 10 Bribery thus raises the risks of doing business,\nputting a company’s bottom line and reputation in jeopardy.\nCompanies that pay bribes to win business ultimately\nundermine their own long-term interests and the best interests\nof their investors.\nHistorical Background\nCongress enacted the FCPA in 1977 after revelations\nof widespread global corruption in the wake of the\nWatergate political scandal. SEC discovered that more than\n400 U.S. companies had paid hundreds of millions of dollars\nin bribes to foreign government officials to secure business\noverseas. 11 SEC reported that companies were using\nsecret “slush funds” to make illegal campaign contributions\nin the United States and corrupt payments to foreign officials\nabroad and were falsifying their corporate financial\nrecords to conceal the payments. 12\nCongress viewed passage of the FCPA as critical\nto stopping corporate bribery, which had tarnished the\nimage of U.S. businesses, impaired public confidence in\nthe financial integrity of U.S. companies, and hampered\nthe efficient functioning of the markets. 13 As Congress\nNo problem does more to alienate citizens\nfrom their political leaders and institutions,\nand to undermine political stability and\neconomic development, than endemic\ncorruption among the government, political\nparty leaders, judges, and bureaucrats.\n— USAID Anti-Corruption Strategy\nrecognized when it passed the FCPA, corruption imposes\nenormous costs both at home and abroad, leading to market\ninefficiencies and instability, sub-standard products,\nand an unfair playing field for honest businesses. 14 By\nenacting a strong foreign bribery statute, Congress sought\nto minimize these destructive effects and help companies\nresist corrupt demands, while addressing the destructive\nforeign policy ramifications of transnational bribery.\n15 The Act also prohibited off-the-books accounting\nthrough provisions designed to “strengthen the accuracy\nof the corporate books and records and the reliability of\nthe audit process which constitute the foundations of our\nsystem of corporate disclosure.” 16\nIn 1988, Congress amended the FCPA to add two\naffirmative defenses: (1) the local law defense; and (2) the\nreasonable and bona fide promotional expense defense. 17\nCongress also requested that the President negotiate an\ninternational treaty with members of the Organisation\nfor Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)\nto prohibit bribery in international business transactions\nby many of the United States’ major trading partners. 18\nSubsequent negotiations at the OECD culminated in the\nConvention on Combating Bribery of Foreign Officials\nin International Business Transactions (Anti-Bribery\nConvention), which, among other things, required parties\nto make it a crime to bribe foreign officials. 19\n3\nDOJ Contact Information\nDeputy Chief (FCPA Unit)\nFraud Section, Criminal Division\nBond Building\n1400 New York Ave, N.W.\nWashington, DC 20005\nTelephone: (202) 514-7023\nFacsimile: (202) 514-7021\nEmail: FCPA.Fraud@usdoj.gov\nIn 1998, the FCPA was amended to conform to\nthe requirements of the Anti-Bribery Convention. These\namendments expanded the FCPA’s scope to: (1) include\npayments made to secure “any improper advantage”; (2)\nreach certain foreign persons who commit an act in furtherance\nof a foreign bribe while in the United States; (3)\ncover public international organizations in the definition\nof “foreign official”; (4) add an alternative basis for jurisdiction\nbased on nationality; and (5) apply criminal penalties\nto foreign nationals employed by or acting as agents\nof U.S. companies. 20 The Anti-Bribery Convention came\ninto force on February 15, 1999, with the United States\nas a founding party.\nNational Landscape: Interagency\nEfforts\nDOJ and SEC share enforcement authority for the\nFCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting provisions. 21 They also\nwork with many other federal agencies and law enforcement\npartners to investigate and prosecute FCPA violations,\nreduce bribery demands through good governance\nprograms and other measures, and promote a fair playing\nfield for U.S. companies doing business abroad.\nchapter 1\nIntroduction\ndirectors, employees, agents, or stockholders acting on the\nissuer’s behalf. DOJ also has both criminal and civil enforcement\nresponsibility for the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions\nover “domestic concerns”—which include (a) U.S. citizens,\nnationals, and residents and (b) U.S. businesses and their\nofficers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders acting\non the domestic concern’s behalf—and certain foreign\npersons and businesses that act in furtherance of an FCPA\nviolation while in the territory of the United States. Within\nDOJ, the Fraud Section of the Criminal Division has primary\nresponsibility for all FCPA matters. 22 FCPA matters\nare handled primarily by the FCPA Unit within the Fraud\nSection, regularly working jointly with U.S. Attorneys’\nOffices around the country.\nDOJ maintains a website dedicated to the FCPA and\nits enforcement at http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/\nfcpa/. The website provides translations of the FCPA in\nnumerous languages, relevant legislative history, and selected\ndocuments from FCPA-related prosecutions and resolutions\nsince 1977, including charging documents, plea agreements,\ndeferred prosecution agreements, non-prosecution agreements,\npress releases, and other relevant pleadings and court\ndecisions. The website also provides copies of opinions issued\nin response to requests by companies and individuals under\nDOJ’s FCPA opinion procedure. The procedures for submitting\na request for an opinion can be found at http://www.\njustice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/docs/frgncrpt.pdf and are\ndiscussed further in Chapter 9. Individuals and companies\nwishing to disclose information about potential FCPA violations\nare encouraged to contact the FCPA Unit at the telephone\nnumber or email address above.\nDepartment of Justice\nDOJ has criminal FCPA enforcement authority\nover “issuers” (i.e., public companies) and their officers,\nSecurities and Exchange Commission\nSEC is responsible for civil enforcement of the FCPA\nover issuers and their officers, directors, employees, agents,\n4\nSEC Contact Information\nFCPA Unit Chief\nDivision of Enforcement\nU.S. Securities and Exchange Commission\n100 F Street, N.E.\nWashington, DC 20549\nOnline: Tips, Complaints, and\nReferrals website\nhttp://www.sec.gov/complaint/tipscomplaint.shtml\nOffice of Investor Education and Advocacy:\n(800) SEC-0330\nor stockholders acting on the issuer’s behalf. SEC’s Division\nof Enforcement has responsibility for investigating and\nprosecuting FCPA violations. In 2010, SEC’s Enforcement\nDivision created a specialized FCPA Unit, with attorneys\nin Washington, D.C. and in regional offices around the\ncountry, to focus specifically on FCPA enforcement. The\nUnit investigates potential FCPA violations; facilitates\ncoordination with DOJ’s FCPA program and with other\nfederal and international law enforcement partners; uses its\nexpert knowledge of the law to promote consistent enforcement\nof the FCPA; analyzes tips, complaints, and referrals\nregarding allegations of foreign bribery; and conducts public\noutreach to raise awareness of anti-corruption efforts\nand good corporate governance programs.\nThe FCPA Unit maintains a “Spotlight on FCPA”\nsection on SEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov/spotlight/\nfcpa.shtml. The website, which is updated regularly, provides\ngeneral information about the Act, links to all SEC\nenforcement actions involving the FCPA, including both\nfederal court actions and administrative proceedings, and\ncontains other useful information.\nIndividuals and companies with information about\npossible FCPA violations by issuers may report them to the\nEnforcement Division via SEC’s online Tips, Complaints\nand Referral system, http://www.sec.gov/complaint/tipscomplaint.shtml.\nThey may also submit information to\nSEC’s Office of the Whistleblower through the same online\nsystem or by contacting the Office of the Whistleblower\nat (202) 551-4790. Additionally, investors with questions\nabout the FCPA can call the Office of Investor Education\nand Advocacy at (800) SEC-0330.\nFor more information about SEC’s Whistleblower\nProgram, under which certain eligible whistleblowers may\nbe entitled to a monetary award if their information leads to\ncertain SEC actions, see Chapter 8.\nLaw Enforcement Partners\nDOJ’s FCPA Unit regularly works with the Federal\nBureau of Investigation (FBI) to investigate potential FCPA\nviolations. The FBI’s International Corruption Unit has primary\nresponsibility for international corruption and fraud\ninvestigations and coordinates the FBI’s national FCPA\nenforcement program. The FBI also has a dedicated FCPA\nsquad of FBI special agents (located in the Washington\nField Office) that is responsible for investigating many, and\nproviding support for all, of the FBI’s FCPA investigations.\nIn addition, the Department of Homeland Security and the\nInternal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation regularly\ninvestigate potential FCPA violations. A number of other\nagencies are also involved in the fight against international\ncorruption, including the Department of Treasury’s Office\nof Foreign Assets Control, which has helped lead a number\nof FCPA investigations.\nDepartments of Commerce and State\nBesides enforcement efforts by DOJ and SEC,\nthe U.S. government is also working to address corruption\nabroad and level the playing field for U.S. businesses\nthrough the efforts of the Departments of Commerce and\nState. Both Commerce and State advance anti-corruption\nand good governance initiatives globally and regularly\nassist U.S. companies doing business overseas in several\n5\nimportant ways. Both agencies encourage U.S. businesses\nto seek the assistance of U.S embassies when they are confronted\nwith bribe solicitations or other corruption-related\nissues overseas. 23\nThe Department of Commerce offers a number\nof important resources for businesses, including the\nInternational Trade Administration’s United States and\nForeign Commercial Service (Commercial Service). The\nCommercial Service has export and industry specialists\nlocated in over 100 U.S. cities and 70 countries who are\navailable to provide counseling and other assistance to U.S.\nbusinesses, particularly small and medium-sized companies,\nregarding exporting their products and services. Among\nother things, these specialists can help a U.S. company conduct\ndue diligence when choosing business partners or agents\noverseas. The International Company Profile Program, for\ninstance, can be part of a U.S. business’ evaluation of potential\noverseas business partners. 24 Businesses may contact the\nCommercial Service through its website, http://export.gov/\neac/, or directly at its domestic and foreign offices. 25\nAdditionally, the Department of Commerce’s Office\nof the General Counsel maintains a website, http://www.\ncommerce.gov/os/ogc/transparency-and-anti-briberyinitiatives,\nthat contains recent articles and speeches, links\nto translations of the FCPA, a catalogue of anti-corruption\nresources, and a list of international conventions and initiatives.\nThe Trade Compliance Center in the Department\nof Commerce’s International Trade Administration hosts\na website with anti-bribery resources, http://tcc.export.\ngov/Bribery. This website contains an online form through\nwhich U.S. companies can report allegations of foreign\nbribery by foreign competitors in international business\ntransactions. 26 The Department of Commerce also provides\ninformation to companies through a number of U.S.\nand international publications designed to assist firms in\ncomplying with anti-corruption laws. For example, the\nDepartment of Commerce has included a new anti-corruption\nsection in its Country Commercial Guides, prepared\nby market experts at U.S. embassies worldwide, that contains\ninformation on market conditions for more than 100 countries,\nincluding information on the FCPA for exporters. 27\nchapter 1\nIntroduction\nThe Department of Commerce has also published a guide,\nBusiness Ethics: A Manual for Managing a Responsible\nBusiness Enterprise in Emerging Market Economies, which\ncontains information about corporate compliance programs\nfor businesses involved in international trade. 28\nThe Departments of Commerce and State also provide\nadvocacy support, when determined to be in the\nnational interest, for U.S. companies bidding for foreign\ngovernment contracts. The Department of Commerce’s\nAdvocacy Center, for example, supports U.S. businesses\ncompeting against foreign companies for international contracts,\nsuch as by arranging for the delivery of an advocacy\nmessage by U.S. government officials or assisting with unanticipated\nproblems such as suspected bribery by a competitor.\n29 The Department of State’s Bureau of Economic and\nBusiness Affairs (specifically, its Office of Commercial and\nBusiness Affairs) similarly assists U.S. firms doing business\noverseas by providing advocacy on behalf of U.S. businesses\nand identifying risk areas for U.S. businesses; more information\nis available on its website, http://www.state.gov/e/\neb/cba/. Also, the Department of State’s economic officers\nserving overseas provide commercial advocacy and support\nfor U.S. companies at the many overseas diplomatic posts\nwhere the Commercial Service is not represented.\nThe Department of State promotes U.S. government\ninterests in addressing corruption internationally through\ncountry-to-country diplomatic engagement; development\nof and follow-through on international commitments relating\nto corruption; promotion of high-level political engagement\n(e.g., the G20 Anticorruption Action Plan); public\noutreach in foreign countries; and support for building\nthe capacity of foreign partners to combat corruption. In\nfiscal year 2009, the U.S. government provided more than\n$1 billion for anti-corruption and related good governance\nassistance abroad.\n6\nThe Department of State’s Bureau of International\nNarcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) manages\nU.S. participation in many multilateral anti-corruption\npolitical and legal initiatives at the global and regional level.\nINL also funds and coordinates significant efforts to assist\ncountries with combating corruption through legal reform,\ntraining, and other capacity-building efforts. Inquiries about\nthe U.S. government’s general anti-corruption efforts and\nimplementation of global and regional anti-corruption initiatives\nmay be directed to INL on its website, http://www.\nstate.gov/j/inl/c/crime/corr/index.htm, or by email to:\nanticorruption@state.gov. In addition, the U.S. Agency for\nInternational Development (USAID) has developed several\nanti-corruption programs and publications, information\nabout which can be found at http://www.usaid.gov/whatwe-do/democracy-human-rights-and-governance/promoting-accountability-transparency.\nFinally, the Department of\nState’s brochure “Fighting Global Corruption: Business Risk\nManagement,” available at http://www.ogc.doc.gov/pdfs/\nFighting_Global_Corruption.pdf, provides guidance about\ncorporate compliance programs as well as international anticorruption\ninitiatives.\nInternational Landscape: Global Anti-\nCorruption Efforts\nIn recent years, there has been a growing international\nconsensus that corruption must be combated, and the\nUnited States and other countries are parties to a number\nof international anti-corruption conventions. Under these\nconventions, countries that are parties undertake commitments\nto adopt a range of preventive and criminal law measures\nto combat corruption. The conventions incorporate\nreview processes that allow the United States to monitor\nother countries to ensure that they are meeting their international\nobligations. Likewise, these processes in turn permit\nother parties to monitor the United States’ anti-corruption\nlaws and enforcement to ensure that such enforcement and\nlegal frameworks are consistent with the United States’ treaty\nobligations. 30 U.S. officials regularly address the subject of\ncorruption with our foreign counterparts to raise awareness\nof the importance of fighting corruption and urge stronger\nenforcement of anti-corruption laws and policies.\nOECD Working Group on Bribery and the Anti-\nBribery Convention\nThe OECD was founded in 1961 to stimulate economic\nprogress and world trade. As noted, the Anti-Bribery\nConvention requires its parties to criminalize the bribery\nof foreign public officials in international business transactions.\n31 As of November 1, 2012, there were 39 parties to\nthe Anti-Bribery Convention: 34 OECD member countries\n(including the United States) and five non-OECD\nmember countries (Argentina, Brazil, Bulgaria, the Russian\nFederation, and South Africa). All of these parties are\nalso members of the OECD Working Group on Bribery\n(Working Group). 32\nThe Working Group is responsible for monitoring the\nimplementation of the Anti-Bribery Convention, the 2009\nRecommendation of the Council for Further Combating\nBribery of Foreign Public Officials in International\nBusiness Transactions, and related instruments. Its members\nmeet quarterly to review and monitor implementation\nof the Anti-Bribery Convention by member states around\nthe world. Each party undergoes periodic peer review. 33\nThis peer-review monitoring system is conducted in three\nphases. The Phase 1 review includes an in-depth assessment\nof each country’s domestic laws implementing the\nConvention. The Phase 2 review examines the effectiveness\nof each country’s laws and anti-bribery efforts. The final\nphase is a permanent cycle of peer review (the first cycle of\nwhich is referred to as the Phase 3 review) that evaluates\na country’s enforcement actions and results, as well as the\ncountry’s efforts to address weaknesses identified during the\nPhase 2 review. 34 All of the monitoring reports for the parties\nto the Convention can be found on the OECD website\nand can be a useful resource about the foreign bribery laws\nof the OECD Working Group member countries. 35\nThe United States was one of the first countries to\nundergo all three phases of review. The reports and appendices\ncan be found on DOJ’s and SEC’s websites. 36 In its\n7\nPhase 3 review of the United States, which was completed\nin October 2010, the Working Group commended U.S.\nefforts to fight transnational bribery and highlighted a\nnumber of best practices developed by the United States.\nThe report also noted areas where the United States’ antibribery\nefforts could be improved, including consolidating\npublicly available information on the application of\nthe FCPA and enhancing awareness among small- and\nmedium-sized companies about the prevention and detection\nof foreign bribery. This guide is, in part, a response to\nthese Phase 3 recommendations and is intended to help\nbusinesses and individuals better understand the FCPA. 37\nU.N. Convention Against Corruption\nThe United States is a state party to the United\nNations Convention Against Corruption (UNCAC),\nwhich was adopted by the U.N. General Assembly on\nOctober 31, 2003, and entered into force on December\n14, 2005. 38 The United States ratified the UNCAC on\nOctober 30, 2006. The UNCAC requires parties to criminalize\na wide range of corrupt acts, including domestic and\nforeign bribery and related offenses such as money laundering\nand obstruction of justice. The UNCAC also establishes\nguidelines for the creation of anti-corruption bodies,\ncodes of conduct for public officials, transparent and objective\nsystems of procurement, and enhanced accounting and\nauditing standards for the private sector. A peer review\nmechanism assesses the implementation of the UNCAC\nby parties to the Convention, with a focus in the first round\non criminalization and law enforcement as well as international\nlegal cooperation. 39 The United States has been\nreviewed under the Pilot Review Programme, the report\nof which is available on DOJ’s website. As of November 1,\n2012, 163 countries were parties to the UNCAC. 40\nchapter 1\nIntroduction\nThe IACAC requires parties (of which the United States\nis one) to criminalize both foreign and domestic bribery.\nA body known as the Mechanism for Follow-Up on\nthe Implementation of the Inter-American Convention\nAgainst Corruption (MESICIC) monitors parties’ compliance\nwith the IACAC. As of November 1, 2012, 31 countries\nwere parties to MESICIC.\nThe Council of Europe established the Group of\nStates Against Corruption (GRECO) in 1999 to monitor\ncountries’ compliance with the Council of Europe’s anticorruption\nstandards, including the Council of Europe’s\nCriminal Law Convention on Corruption. 42 These standards\ninclude prohibitions on the solicitation and receipt of\nbribes, as well as foreign bribery. As of November 1, 2012,\nGRECO member states, which need not be members of\nthe Council of Europe, include more than 45 European\ncountries and the United States. 43\nThe United States has been reviewed under both\nMESICIC and GRECO, and the reports generated by\nthose reviews are available on DOJ’s website.\nOther Anti-Corruption Conventions\nThe Inter-American Convention Against Corruption\n(IACAC) was the first international anti-corruption convention,\nadopted in March 1996 in Caracas, Venezuela,\nby members of the Organization of American States. 41\n8\n\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nTHE FCPA: ANTI-BRIBERY\nPROVISIONS\nThe FCPA addresses the problem of international corruption in two ways: (1)\nthe anti-bribery provisions, which are discussed below, prohibit individuals\nand businesses from bribing foreign government officials in order to obtain\nor retain business and (2) the accounting provisions, which are discussed in\nChapter 3, impose certain record keeping and internal control requirements\non issuers, and prohibit individuals and companies from knowingly falsifying\nan issuer’s books and records or circumventing or failing to implement an issuer’s\nsystem of internal controls. Violations of the FCPA can lead to civil and\ncriminal penalties, sanctions, and remedies, including fines, disgorgement,\nand/or imprisonment.\nIn general, the FCPA prohibits offering to pay, paying,\npromising to pay, or authorizing the payment of money\nor anything of value to a foreign official in order to influence\nany act or decision of the foreign official in his or her\nofficial capacity or to secure any other improper advantage\nin order to obtain or retain business. 44\nWho Is Covered by the Anti-Bribery Provisions?\nThe FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions apply broadly to\nthree categories of persons and entities: (1) “issuers” and\ntheir officers, directors, employees, agents, and shareholders;\n(2) “domestic concerns” and their officers, directors,\nemployees, agents, and shareholders; and (3) certain persons\nand entities, other than issuers and domestic concerns,\nacting while in the territory of the United States.\nIssuers—15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1\nSection 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934\n(the Exchange Act), which can be found at 15 U.S.C.\n§ 78dd-1, contains the anti-bribery provision governing\n10\nHow Can I Tell If My Company Is an “Issuer”?\n• It is listed on a national securities exchange in the\nUnited States (either stock or American Depository\nReceipts); or\n• The company’s stock trades in the over-thecounter\nmarket in the United States and the\ncompany is required to file SEC reports.\n• To see if your company files SEC reports, go to\nSEC’s website at http://www.sec.gov/edgar/\nsearchedgar/webusers.htm.\nissuers. 45 A company is an “issuer” under the FCPA if it\nhas a class of securities registered under Section 12 of the\nExchange Act 46 or is required to file periodic and other\nreports with SEC under Section 15(d) of the Exchange\nAct. 47 In practice, this means that any company with a\nclass of securities listed on a national securities exchange in\nthe United States, or any company with a class of securities\nquoted in the over-the-counter market in the United\nStates and required to file periodic reports with SEC, is an\nissuer. A company thus need not be a U.S. company to be\nan issuer. Foreign companies with American Depository\nReceipts that are listed on a U.S. exchange are also issuers. 48\nAs of December 31, 2011, 965 foreign companies were registered\nwith SEC. 49 Officers, directors, employees, agents,\nor stockholders acting on behalf of an issuer (whether U.S.\nor foreign nationals), and any co-conspirators, also can be\nprosecuted under the FCPA. 50\nDomestic Concerns—15 U.S.C. § 78dd-2\nThe FCPA also applies to “domestic concerns.” 51 A\ndomestic concern is any individual who is a citizen, national,\nor resident of the United States, or any corporation, partnership,\nassociation, joint-stock company, business trust,\nunincorporated organization, or sole proprietorship that is\norganized under the laws of the United States or its states,\nterritories, possessions, or commonwealths or that has its\nprincipal place of business in the United States. 52 Officers,\ndirectors, employees, agents, or stockholders acting on\nbehalf of a domestic concern, including foreign nationals or\ncompanies, are also covered. 53\nTerritorial Jurisdiction—15 U.S.C. § 78dd-3\nThe FCPA also applies to certain foreign nationals or\nentities that are not issuers or domestic concerns. 54 Since\n1998, the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions have applied to\nforeign persons and foreign non-issuer entities that, either\ndirectly or through an agent, engage in any act in furtherance\nof a corrupt payment (or an offer, promise, or authorization\nto pay) while in the territory of the United States. 55\nAlso, officers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders\nacting on behalf of such persons or entities may be subject\nto the FCPA’s anti-bribery prohibitions. 56\nWhat Jurisdictional Conduct Triggers the Anti-\nBribery Provisions?\nThe FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions can apply to\nconduct both inside and outside the United States. Issuers\nand domestic concerns—as well as their officers, directors,\nemployees, agents, or stockholders—may be prosecuted\nfor using the U.S. mails or any means or instrumentality of\ninterstate commerce in furtherance of a corrupt payment\nto a foreign official. The Act defines “interstate commerce”\nas “trade, commerce, transportation, or communication\namong the several States, or between any foreign country\nand any State or between any State and any place or ship\noutside thereof ….” 57 The term also includes the intrastate\nuse of any interstate means of communication, or any other\ninterstate instrumentality. 58 Thus, placing a telephone call or\nsending an e-mail, text message, or fax from, to, or through\nthe United States involves interstate commerce—as does\nsending a wire transfer from or to a U.S. bank or otherwise\nusing the U.S. banking system, or traveling across state borders\nor internationally to or from the United States.\nThose who are not issuers or domestic concerns may\nbe prosecuted under the FCPA if they directly, or through\nan agent, engage in any act in furtherance of a corrupt payment\nwhile in the territory of the United States, regardless of\n11\nwhether they utilize the U.S. mails or a means or instrumentality\nof interstate commerce. 59 Thus, for example, a foreign\nnational who attends a meeting in the United States that furthers\na foreign bribery scheme may be subject to prosecution,\nas may any co-conspirators, even if they did not themselves\nattend the meeting. A foreign national or company may also\nbe liable under the FCPA if it aids and abets, conspires with,\nor acts as an agent of an issuer or domestic concern, regardless\nof whether the foreign national or company itself takes any\naction in the United States. 60\nIn addition, under the “alternative jurisdiction” provision\nof the FCPA enacted in 1998, U.S. companies or\npersons may be subject to the anti-bribery provisions even\nif they act outside the United States. 61 The 1998 amendments\nto the FCPA expanded the jurisdictional coverage of\nthe Act by establishing an alternative basis for jurisdiction,\nthat is, jurisdiction based on the nationality principle. 62 In\nparticular, the 1998 amendments removed the requirement\nthat there be a use of interstate commerce (e.g., wire, email,\ntelephone call) for acts in furtherance of a corrupt payment\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nto a foreign official by U.S. companies and persons occurring\nwholly outside of the United States. 63\nWhat Is Covered?—The Business\nPurpose Test\nThe FCPA applies only to payments intended to\ninduce or influence a foreign official to use his or her position\n“in order to assist … in obtaining or retaining business\nfor or with, or directing business to, any person.” 64 This\nrequirement is known as the “business purpose test” and is\nbroadly interpreted. 65\nNot surprisingly, many enforcement actions involve\nbribes to obtain or retain government contracts. 66 The\nFCPA also prohibits bribes in the conduct of business or\nHypothetical: FCPA Jurisdiction\nCompany A, a Delaware company with its principal place of business in New York, is a large energy company that\noperates globally, including in a number of countries that have a high risk of corruption, such as Foreign Country. Company\nA’s shares are listed on a national U.S. stock exchange. Company A enters into an agreement with a European company\n(EuroCo) to submit a joint bid to the Oil Ministry to build a refinery in Foreign Country. EuroCo is not an issuer.\nExecutives of Company A and EuroCo meet in New York to discuss how to win the bid and decide to hire a purported\nthird-party consultant (Intermediary) and have him use part of his “commission” to bribe high-ranking officials within the\nOil Ministry. Intermediary meets with executives at Company A and EuroCo in New York to finalize the scheme. Eventually,\nmillions of dollars in bribes are funneled from the United States and Europe through Intermediary to high-ranking officials\nat the Oil Ministry, and Company A and EuroCo win the contract. A few years later, a front page article alleging that the\ncontract was procured through bribery appears in Foreign Country, and DOJ and SEC begin investigating whether the\nFCPA was violated.\nBased on these facts, which entities fall within the FCPA’s jurisdiction?\nAll of the entities easily fall within the FCPA’s jurisdiction. Company A is both an “issuer” and a “domestic concern”\nunder the FCPA, and Intermediary is an “agent” of Company A. EuroCo and Intermediary are also subject to the FCPA’s\nterritorial jurisdiction provision based on their conduct while in the United States. Moreover, even if EuroCo and Intermediary\nhad never taken any actions in the territory of the United States, they can still be subject to jurisdiction under a traditional\napplication of conspiracy law and may be subject to substantive FCPA charges under Pinkerton liability, namely, being liable\nfor the reasonably foreseeable substantive FCPA crimes committed by a co-conspirator in furtherance of the conspiracy.\n12\nExamples of Actions Taken\nto Obtain or Retain Business\n• Winning a contract\n• Influencing the procurement process\n• Circumventing the rules for importation of\nproducts\n• Gaining access to non-public bid tender\ninformation\n• Evading taxes or penalties\n• Influencing the adjudication of lawsuits or\nenforcement actions\n• Obtaining exceptions to regulations\n• Avoiding contract termination\nheld that payments to obtain favorable tax treatment can,\nunder appropriate circumstances, violate the FCPA:\nAvoiding or lowering taxes reduces operating costs\nand thus increases profit margins, thereby freeing up\nfunds that the business is otherwise legally obligated\nto expend. And this, in turn, enables it to take any\nnumber of actions to the disadvantage of competitors.\nBribing foreign officials to lower taxes and customs\nduties certainly can provide an unfair advantage\nover competitors and thereby be of assistance to the\npayor in obtaining or retaining business.\n* * *\n[W]e hold that Congress intended for the FCPA\nto apply broadly to payments intended to assist the\npayor, either directly or indirectly, in obtaining or\nretaining business for some person, and that bribes\npaid to foreign tax officials to secure illegally reduced\ncustoms and tax liability constitute a type of payment\nthat can fall within this broad coverage. 72\nto gain a business advantage. 67 For example, bribe payments\nmade to secure favorable tax treatment, to reduce or eliminate\ncustoms duties, to obtain government action to prevent\ncompetitors from entering a market, or to circumvent\na licensing or permit requirement, all satisfy the business\npurpose test. 68\nIn 2004, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit\naddressed the business purpose test in United States v. Kay\nand held that bribes paid to obtain favorable tax treatment—\nwhich reduced a company’s customs duties and sales taxes\non imports—could constitute payments made to “obtain\nor retain” business within the meaning of the FCPA. 69 The\ncourt explained that in enacting the FCPA, “Congress meant\nto prohibit a range of payments wider than only those that\ndirectly influence the acquisition or retention of government\ncontracts or similar commercial or industrial arrangements.”\n70 The Kay court found that “[t]he congressional\ntarget was bribery paid to engender assistance in improving\nthe business opportunities of the payor or his beneficiary,\nirrespective of whether that assistance be direct or indirect,\nand irrespective of whether it be related to administering\nthe law, awarding, extending, or renewing a contract, or\nexecuting or preserving an agreement.” 71 Accordingly, Kay\nPaying Bribes to Customs Officials\nIn 2010, a global freight forwarding company and\nsix of its corporate customers in the oil and gas industry\nresolved charges that they paid bribes to customs\nofficials. The companies bribed customs officials in more\nthan ten countries in exchange for such benefits as:\n• evading customs duties on imported goods\n• improperly expediting the importation of goods\nand equipment\n• extending drilling contracts and lowering tax\nassessments\n• obtaining false documentation related to\ntemporary import permits for drilling rigs\n• enabling the release of drilling rigs and other\nequipment from customs officials\nIn many instances, the improper payments at issue\nallowed the company to carry out its existing business,\nwhich fell within the FCPA’s prohibition on corrupt\npayments made for the purpose of “retaining” business.\nThe seven companies paid a total of more than $235\nmillion in civil and criminal sanctions and disgorgement.\n13\nIn short, while the FCPA does not cover every type\nof bribe paid around the world for every purpose, it does\napply broadly to bribes paid to help obtain or retain business,\nwhich can include payments made to secure a wide\nvariety of unfair business advantages. 73\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nWhat Does “Corruptly” Mean?\nTo violate the FCPA, an offer, promise, or authorization\nof a payment, or a payment, to a government official\nmust be made “corruptly.” 74 As Congress noted when\nadopting the FCPA, the word “corruptly” means an intent\nor desire to wrongfully influence the recipient:\nThe word “corruptly” is used in order to make clear\nthat the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must be intended\nto induce the recipient to misuse his official\nposition; for example, wrongfully to direct business\nto the payor or his client, to obtain preferential legislation\nor regulations, or to induce a foreign official to\nfail to perform an official function. 75\nWhere corrupt intent is present, the FCPA prohibits\npaying, offering, or promising to pay money or anything\nof value (or authorizing the payment or offer). 76 By focusing\non intent, the FCPA does not require that a corrupt\nact succeed in its purpose. 77 Nor must the foreign official\nactually solicit, accept, or receive the corrupt payment for\nthe bribe payor to be liable. 78 For example, in one case, a\nspecialty chemical company promised Iraqi government\nofficials approximately $850,000 in bribes for an upcoming\ncontract. Although the company did not, in the end, make\nthe payment (the scheme was thwarted by the U.S. government’s\ninvestigation), the company still violated the FCPA\nand was held accountable. 79\nAlso, as long as the offer, promise, authorization, or\npayment is made corruptly, the actor need not know the\nidentity of the recipient; the attempt is sufficient. 80 Thus, an\nexecutive who authorizes others to pay “whoever you need\nto” in a foreign government to obtain a contract has violated\nthe FCPA—even if no bribe is ultimately offered or paid.\nWhat Does “Willfully” Mean and When\nDoes It Apply?\nIn order for an individual defendant to be criminally\nliable under the FCPA, he or she must act “willfully.” 81 Proof\nof willfulness is not required to establish corporate criminal\nor civil liability, 82 though proof of corrupt intent is.\nThe term “willfully” is not defined in the FCPA, but\nit has generally been construed by courts to connote an\nact committed voluntarily and purposefully, and with a\nbad purpose, i.e., with “knowledge that [a defendant] was\ndoing a ‘bad’ act under the general rules of law.” 83 As the\nSupreme Court explained in Bryan v. United States, “[a]s a\ngeneral matter, when used in the criminal context, a ‘willful’\nact is one undertaken with a ‘bad purpose.’ In other\nwords, in order to establish a ‘willful’ violation of a statute,\n‘the Government must prove that the defendant acted with\nknowledge that his conduct was unlawful.’” 84\nNotably, as both the Second Circuit and Fifth Circuit\nCourts of Appeals have found, the FCPA does not require\nthe government to prove that a defendant was specifically\naware of the FCPA or knew that his conduct violated the\nFCPA. 85 To be guilty, a defendant must act with a bad purpose,\ni.e., know generally that his conduct is unlawful.\nWhat Does “Anything of Value” Mean?\nIn enacting the FCPA, Congress recognized that bribes\ncan come in many shapes and sizes—a broad range of unfair\nbenefits 86 —and so the statute prohibits the corrupt “offer,\npayment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of\nany money, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of\nthe giving of anything of value to” a foreign official. 87\nAn improper benefit can take many forms. While\ncases often involve payments of cash (sometimes in the\nguise of “consulting fees” or “commissions” given through\nintermediaries), others have involved travel expenses and\n14\nexpensive gifts. Like the domestic bribery statute, the FCPA\ndoes not contain a minimum threshold amount for corrupt\ngifts or payments. 88 Indeed, what might be considered a\nmodest payment in the United States could be a larger and\nmuch more significant amount in a foreign country.\nRegardless of size, for a gift or other payment to violate\nthe statute, the payor must have corrupt intent—that is,\nthe intent to improperly influence the government official.\nThe corrupt intent requirement protects companies that\nengage in the ordinary and legitimate promotion of their\nbusinesses while targeting conduct that seeks to improperly\ninduce officials into misusing their positions. Thus, it\nis difficult to envision any scenario in which the provision\nof cups of coffee, taxi fare, or company promotional items\nof nominal value would ever evidence corrupt intent, and\nneither DOJ nor SEC has ever pursued an investigation\non the basis of such conduct. Moreover, as in all areas of\nfederal law enforcement, DOJ and SEC exercise discretion\nin deciding which cases promote law enforcement priorities\nand justify investigation. Certain patterns, however,\nhave emerged: DOJ’s and SEC’s anti-bribery enforcement\nactions have focused on small payments and gifts only when\nthey comprise part of a systemic or long-standing course of\nconduct that evidences a scheme to corruptly pay foreign\nofficials to obtain or retain business. These assessments are\nnecessarily fact specific.\nCash\nThe most obvious form of corrupt payment is large\namounts of cash. In some instances, companies have maintained\ncash funds specifically earmarked for use as bribes.\nOne U.S. issuer headquartered in Germany disbursed corrupt\npayments from a corporate “cash desk” and used offshore\nbank accounts to bribe government officials to win\ncontracts. 89 In another instance, a four-company joint venture\nused its agent to pay $5 million in bribes to a Nigerian\npolitical party. 90 The payments were made to the agent in\nsuitcases of cash (typically in $1 million installments), and,\nin one instance, the trunk of a car when the cash did not fit\ninto a suitcase. 91\nGifts, Travel, Entertainment, and Other Things\nof Value\nA small gift or token of esteem or gratitude is often\nan appropriate way for business people to display respect\nfor each other. Some hallmarks of appropriate gift-giving\nare when the gift is given openly and transparently, properly\nrecorded in the giver’s books and records, provided only to\nreflect esteem or gratitude, and permitted under local law.\nItems of nominal value, such as cab fare, reasonable\nmeals and entertainment expenses, or company promotional\nitems, are unlikely to improperly influence an official,\nand, as a result, are not, without more, items that have\nresulted in enforcement action by DOJ or SEC. The larger\nor more extravagant the gift, however, the more likely it was\ngiven with an improper purpose. DOJ and SEC enforcement\ncases thus have involved single instances of large,\nextravagant gift-giving (such as sports cars, fur coats, and\nother luxury items) as well as widespread gifts of smaller\nitems as part of a pattern of bribes. 92 For example, in one\ncase brought by DOJ and SEC, a defendant gave a government\nofficial a country club membership fee and a generator,\nas well as household maintenance expenses, payment\nof cell phone bills, an automobile worth $20,000, and limousine\nservices. The same official also received $250,000\nthrough a third-party agent. 93\nIn addition, a number of FCPA enforcement actions\nhave involved the corrupt payment of travel and entertainment\nexpenses. Both DOJ and SEC have brought cases\nwhere these types of expenditures occurred in conjunction\nwith other conduct reflecting systemic bribery or other\nclear indicia of corrupt intent.\nA case involving a California-based telecommunications\ncompany illustrates the types of improper travel\nand entertainment expenses that may violate the FCPA. 94\nBetween 2002 and 2007, the company spent nearly $7 million\non approximately 225 trips for its customers in order to\nobtain systems contracts in China, including for employees\nof Chinese state-owned companies to travel to popular tourist\ndestinations in the United States. 95 Although the trips\nwere purportedly for the individuals to conduct training at\n15\nExamples of Improper\nTravel and Entertainment\n• a $12,000 birthday trip for a government decisionmaker\nfrom Mexico that included visits to wineries\nand dinners\n• $10,000 spent on dinners, drinks, and\nentertainment for a government official\n• a trip to Italy for eight Iraqi government officials\nthat consisted primarily of sightseeing and\nincluded $1,000 in “pocket money” for each\nofficial\n• a trip to Paris for a government official and his wife\nthat consisted primarily of touring activities via a\nchauffeur-driven vehicle\nthe company’s facilities, in reality, no training occurred on\nmany of these trips and the company had no facilities at those\nlocations. Approximately $670,000 of the $7 million was\nfalsely recorded as “training” expenses. 96\nLikewise, a New Jersey-based telecommunications\ncompany spent millions of dollars on approximately 315\ntrips for Chinese government officials, ostensibly to inspect\nfactories and train the officials in using the company’s\nequipment. 97 In reality, during many of these trips, the officials\nspent little or no time visiting the company’s facilities,\nbut instead visited tourist destinations such as Hawaii, Las\nVegas, the Grand Canyon, Niagara Falls, Disney World,\nUniversal Studios, and New York City. 98 Some of the trips\nwere characterized as “factory inspections” or “training”\nwith government customers but consisted primarily or\nentirely of sightseeing to locations chosen by the officials,\ntypically lasting two weeks and costing between $25,000\nand $55,000 per trip. In some instances, the company gave\nthe government officials $500 to $1,000 per day in spending\nmoney and paid all lodging, transportation, food,\nand entertainment expenses. The company either failed\nto record these expenses or improperly recorded them as\n“consulting fees” in its corporate books and records. The\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\ncompany also failed to implement appropriate internal controls\nto monitor the provision of travel and other things of\nvalue to Chinese government officials. 99\nCompanies also may violate the FCPA if they give\npayments or gifts to third parties, like an official’s family\nmembers, as an indirect way of corruptly influencing a foreign\nofficial. For example, one defendant paid personal bills\nand provided airline tickets to a cousin and close friend of\nthe foreign official whose influence the defendant sought in\nobtaining contracts. 100 The defendant was convicted at trial\nand received a prison sentence. 101\nAs part of an effective compliance program, a company\nshould have clear and easily accessible guidelines\nand processes in place for gift-giving by the company’s\ndirectors, officers, employees, and agents. Though not\nnecessarily appropriate for every business, many larger\ncompanies have automated gift-giving clearance processes\nand have set clear monetary thresholds for gifts\nalong with annual limitations, with limited exceptions\nfor gifts approved by appropriate management. Clear\nguidelines and processes can be an effective and efficient\nmeans for controlling gift-giving, deterring improper\ngifts, and protecting corporate assets.\nThe FCPA does not prohibit gift-giving. Rather, just\nlike its domestic bribery counterparts, the FCPA prohibits\nthe payments of bribes, including those disguised as gifts.\nCharitable Contributions\nCompanies often engage in charitable giving as part\nof legitimate local outreach. The FCPA does not prohibit\ncharitable contributions or prevent corporations from acting\nas good corporate citizens. Companies, however, cannot\nuse the pretense of charitable contributions as a way to\nfunnel bribes to government officials.\n16\nFor example, a pharmaceutical company used charitable\ndonations to a small local castle restoration charity\nheaded by a foreign government official to induce the official\nto direct business to the company. Although the charity\nwas a bona fide charitable organization, internal documents\nat the pharmaceutical company’s subsidiary established that\nthe payments were not viewed as charitable contributions\nbut rather as “dues” the subsidiary was required to pay for\nassistance from the government official. The payments constituted\na significant portion of the subsidiary’s total promotional\ndonations budget and were structured to allow\nthe subsidiary to exceed its authorized limits. The payments\nHypothetical: Gifts, Travel, and Entertainment\nCompany A is a large U.S. engineering company with global operations in more than 50 countries, including a\nnumber that have a high risk of corruption, such as Foreign Country. Company A’s stock is listed on a national U.S. stock\nexchange. In conducting its business internationally, Company A’s officers and employees come into regular contact with\nforeign officials, including officials in various ministries and state-owned entities. At a trade show, Company A has a booth\nat which it offers free pens, hats, t-shirts, and other similar promotional items with Company A’s logo. Company A also\nserves free coffee, other beverages, and snacks at the booth. Some of the visitors to the booth are foreign officials.\nIs Company A in violation of the FCPA?\nNo. These are legitimate, bona fide expenditures made in connection with the promotion, demonstration, or\nexplanation of Company A’s products or services There is nothing to suggest corrupt intent here The FCPA does not\nprevent companies from promoting their businesses in this way or providing legitimate hospitality, including to foreign\nofficials Providing promotional items with company logos or free snacks as set forth above is an appropriate means of\nproviding hospitality and promoting business Such conduct has never formed the basis for an FCPA enforcement action\nAt the trade show, Company A invites a dozen current and prospective customers out for drinks, and pays\nthe moderate bar tab. Some of the current and prospective customers are foreign officials under the FCPA. Is\nCompany A in violation of the FCPA?\nNo. Again, the FCPA was not designed to prohibit all forms of hospitality to foreign officials. While the cost here may\nbe more substantial than the beverages, snacks, and promotional items provided at the booth, and the invitees specifically\nselected, there is still nothing to suggest corrupt intent.\nTwo years ago, Company A won a long-term contract to supply goods and services to the state-owned Electricity\nCommission in Foreign Country. The Electricity Commission is 100% owned, controlled, and operated by the\ngovernment of Foreign Country, and employees of the Electricity Commission are subject to Foreign Country’s\ndomestic bribery laws. Some Company A executives are in Foreign Country for meetings with officials of the\nElectricity Commission. The General Manager of the Electricity Commission was recently married, and during the\ntrip Company A executives present a moderately priced crystal vase to the General Manager as a wedding gift\nand token of esteem. Is Company A in violation of the FCPA?\nNo. It is appropriate to provide reasonable gifts to foreign officials as tokens of esteem or gratitude. It is important that\nsuch gifts be made openly and transparently, properly recorded in a company’s books and records, and given only where\nappropriate under local law, customary where given, and reasonable for the occasion.\nDuring the course of the contract described above, Company A periodically provides training to Electricity\nCommission employees at its facilities in Michigan. The training is paid for by the Electricity Commission as part of\nthe contract. Senior officials of the Electricity Commission inform Company A that they want to inspect the facilities\nand ensure that the training is working well. Company A pays for the airfare, hotel, and transportation for the\n(cont’d)\n17\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nElectricity Commission senior officials to travel to Michigan to inspect Company A’s facilities. Because it is a lengthy\ninternational flight, Company A agrees to pay for business class airfare, to which its own employees are entitled\nfor lengthy flights. The foreign officials visit Michigan for several days, during which the senior officials perform an\nappropriate inspection. Company A executives take the officials to a moderately priced dinner, a baseball game,\nand a play. Do any of these actions violate the FCPA?\nNo Neither the costs associated with training the employees nor the trip for the senior officials to the Company’s\nfacilities in order to inspect them violates the FCPA Reasonable and bona fide promotional expenditures do not violate\nthe FCPA Here, Company A is providing training to the Electricity Commission’s employees and is hosting the Electricity\nCommission senior officials Their review of the execution and performance of the contract is a legitimate business purpose\nEven the provision of business class airfare is reasonable under the circumstances, as are the meals and entertainment,\nwhich are only a small component of the business trip\nWould this analysis be different if Company A instead paid for the senior officials to travel first-class with their\nspouses for an all-expenses-paid, week-long trip to Las Vegas, where Company A has no facilities?\nYes. This conduct almost certainly violates the FCPA because it evinces a corrupt intent. Here, the trip does not appear\nto be designed for any legitimate business purpose, is extravagant, includes expenses for the officials’ spouses, and therefore\nappears to be designed to corruptly curry favor with the foreign government officials. Moreover, if the trip were booked as a\nlegitimate business expense—such as the provision of training at its facilities—Company A would also be in violation of the\nFCPA’s accounting provisions. Furthermore, this conduct suggests deficiencies in Company A’s internal controls.\nCompany A’s contract with the Electricity Commission is going to expire, and the Electricity Commission is\noffering the next contract through its tender process. An employee of the Electricity Commission contacts\nCompany A and offers to provide Company A with confidential, non-public bid information from Company A’s\ncompetitors if Company A will pay for a vacation to Paris for him and his girlfriend. Employees of Company A\naccede to the official’s request, pay for the vacation, receive the confidential bid information, and yet still do not\nwin the contract. Has Company A violated the FCPA?\nYes Company A has provided things of value to a foreign official for the purpose of inducing the official to misuse\nhis office and to gain an improper advantage It does not matter that it was the foreign official who first suggested the\nillegal conduct or that Company A ultimately was not successful in winning the contract This conduct would also violate\nthe FCPA’s accounting provisions if the trip were booked as a legitimate business expense and suggests deficiencies in\nCompany A’s internal controls\n18\nalso were not in compliance with the company’s internal\npolicies, which provided that charitable donations generally\nshould be made to healthcare institutions and relate to\nthe practice of medicine. 102\nProper due diligence and controls are critical for\ncharitable giving. In general, the adequacy of measures\ntaken to prevent misuse of charitable donations will depend\non a risk-based analysis and the specific facts at hand. In\nOpinion Procedure Release No. 10-02, DOJ described the\ndue diligence and controls that can minimize the likelihood\nof an FCPA violation. In that matter, a Eurasian-based subsidiary\nof a U.S. non-governmental organization was asked\nby an agency of a foreign government to make a grant to\na local microfinance institution (MFI) as a prerequisite to\nthe subsidiary’s transformation to bank status. The subsidiary\nproposed contributing $1.42 million to a local MFI to\nsatisfy the request. The subsidiary undertook an extensive,\nthree-stage due diligence process to select the proposed\ngrantee and imposed significant controls on the proposed\ngrant, including ongoing monitoring and auditing, earmarking\nfunds for capacity building, prohibiting compensation\nof board members, and implementing anti-corruption\ncompliance provisions. DOJ explained that it would\nnot take any enforcement action because the company’s due\ndiligence and the controls it planned to put in place sufficed\nto prevent an FCPA violation.\nOther opinion releases also address charitable-type\ngrants or donations. Under the facts presented in those\nreleases, DOJ approved the proposed grant or donation, 103\nbased on due diligence measures and controls such as:\n• certifications by the recipient regarding compliance\nwith the FCPA; 104\n• due diligence to confirm that none of the recipient’s\nofficers were affiliated with the foreign government\nat issue; 105\n• a requirement that the recipient provide audited\nfinancial statements; 106\n• a written agreement with the recipient restricting\nthe use of funds; 107\n• steps to ensure that the funds were transferred to a\nvalid bank account; 108\n• confirmation that the charity’s commitments were\nmet before funds were disbursed; 109 and\n• on-going monitoring of the efficacy of the\nprogram. 110\nLegitimate charitable giving does not violate the\nFCPA. Compliance with the FCPA merely requires that\ncharitable giving not be used as a vehicle to conceal payments\nmade to corruptly influence foreign officials.\nFive Questions to Consider When Making\nCharitable Payments in a Foreign Country:\n1 What is the purpose of the payment?\n2 Is the payment consistent with the company’s\ninternal guidelines on charitable giving?\n3 Is the payment at the request of a foreign official?\n4 Is a foreign official associated with the charity\nand, if so, can the foreign official make decisions\nregarding your business in that country?\n5 Is the payment conditioned upon receiving\nbusiness or other benefits?\nWho Is a Foreign Official?\nThe FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions apply to corrupt\npayments made to (1) “any foreign official”; (2) “any foreign\npolitical party or official thereof ”; (3) “any candidate for\nforeign political office”; or (4) any person, while knowing\nthat all or a portion of the payment will be offered, given, or\npromised to an individual falling within one of these three\ncategories. 111 Although the statute distinguishes between a\n“foreign official,” “foreign political party or official thereof,”\nand “candidate for foreign political office,” the term “foreign\nofficial” in this guide generally refers to an individual\nfalling within any of these three categories.\nThe FCPA defines “foreign official” to include:\nany officer or employee of a foreign government or\nany department, agency, or instrumentality thereof,\n19\nor of a public international organization, or any person\nacting in an official capacity for or on behalf of\nany such government or department, agency, or instrumentality,\nor for or on behalf of any such public\ninternational organization. 112\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nAs this language makes clear, the FCPA broadly\napplies to corrupt payments to “any” officer or employee\nof a foreign government and to those acting on the foreign\ngovernment’s behalf. 113 The FCPA thus covers corrupt\npayments to low-ranking employees and high-level\nofficials alike. 114\nThe FCPA prohibits payments to foreign officials, not\nto foreign governments. 115 That said, companies contemplating\ncontributions or donations to foreign governments\nshould take steps to ensure that no monies are used for corrupt\npurposes, such as the personal benefit of individual\nforeign officials.\nDepartment, Agency, or Instrumentality of a\nForeign Government\nForeign officials under the FCPA include officers\nor employees of a department, agency, or instrumentality\nof a foreign government. When a foreign government\nis organized in a fashion similar to the U.S. system, what\nconstitutes a government department or agency is typically\nclear (e.g., a ministry of energy, national security agency, or\ntransportation authority). 116 However, governments can be\norganized in very different ways. 117 Many operate through\nstate-owned and state-controlled entities, particularly in\nsuch areas as aerospace and defense manufacturing, banking\nand finance, healthcare and life sciences, energy and\nextractive industries, telecommunications, and transportation.\n118 By including officers or employees of agencies and\ninstrumentalities within the definition of “foreign official,”\nthe FCPA accounts for this variability.\nThe term “instrumentality” is broad and can include\nstate-owned or state-controlled entities. Whether a particular\nentity constitutes an “instrumentality” under the FCPA\nrequires a fact-specific analysis of an entity’s ownership,\ncontrol, status, and function. 119 A number of courts have\napproved final jury instructions providing a non-exclusive\nlist of factors to be considered:\n• the foreign state’s extent of ownership of the entity;\n• the foreign state’s degree of control over the entity\n(including whether key officers and directors of\nthe entity are, or are appointed by, government\nofficials);\n• the foreign state’s characterization of the entity and\nits employees;\n• the circumstances surrounding the entity’s creation;\n• the purpose of the entity’s activities;\n• the entity’s obligations and privileges under the\nforeign state’s law;\n• the exclusive or controlling power vested in the\nentity to administer its designated functions;\n• the level of financial support by the foreign\nstate (including subsidies, special tax treatment,\ngovernment-mandated fees, and loans);\n• the entity’s provision of services to the jurisdiction’s\nresidents;\n• whether the governmental end or purpose sought\nto be achieved is expressed in the policies of the\nforeign government; and\n• the general perception that the entity is performing\nofficial or governmental functions. 120\nCompanies should consider these factors when evaluating\nthe risk of FCPA violations and designing compliance\nprograms.\nDOJ and SEC have pursued cases involving instrumentalities\nsince the time of the FCPA’s enactment and\nhave long used an analysis of ownership, control, status,\nand function to determine whether a particular entity is\nan agency or instrumentality of a foreign government.\nFor example, the second-ever FCPA case charged by DOJ\ninvolved a California company that paid bribes through a\nMexican corporation to two executives of a state-owned\n20\nMexican national oil company. 121 And in the early 1980s,\nDOJ and SEC brought cases involving a $1 million bribe to\nthe chairman of Trinidad and Tobago’s racing authority. 122\nDOJ and SEC continue to regularly bring FCPA\ncases involving bribes paid to employees of agencies and\ninstrumentalities of foreign governments. In one such\ncase, the subsidiary of a Swiss engineering company paid\nbribes to officials of a state-owned and controlled electricity\ncommission. The commission was created by, owned\nby, and controlled by the Mexican government, and it had\na monopoly on the transmission and distribution of electricity\nin Mexico. Many of the commission’s board members\nwere cabinet-level government officials, and the director\nwas appointed by Mexico’s president. 123 Similarly, in\nanother recent case, Miami telecommunications executives\nwere charged with paying bribes to employees of Haiti’s\nstate-owned and controlled telecommunications company.\nThe telecommunications company was 97% owned and\n100% controlled by the Haitian government, and its director\nwas appointed by Haiti’s president. 124\nWhile no one factor is dispositive or necessarily more\nimportant than another, as a practical matter, an entity is\nunlikely to qualify as an instrumentality if a government\ndoes not own or control a majority of its shares. However,\nthere are circumstances in which an entity would qualify\nas an instrumentality absent 50% or greater foreign government\nownership, which is reflected in the limited number\nof DOJ or SEC enforcement actions brought in such\nsituations. For example, in addition to being convicted of\nfunneling millions of dollars in bribes to two sitting presidents\nin two different countries, a French issuer’s three\nsubsidiaries were convicted of paying bribes to employees\nof a Malaysian telecommunications company that was 43%\nowned by Malaysia’s Ministry of Finance. There, notwithstanding\nits minority ownership stake in the company, the\nMinistry held the status of a “special shareholder,” had veto\npower over all major expenditures, and controlled important\noperational decisions. 125 In addition, most senior\ncompany officers were political appointees, including the\nChairman and Director, the Chairman of the Board of the\nTender Committee, and the Executive Director. 126 Thus,\ndespite the Malaysian government having a minority shareholder\nposition, the company was an instrumentality of the\nMalaysian government as the government nevertheless had\nsubstantial control over the company.\nCompanies and individuals should also remember\nthat, whether an entity is an instrumentality of a foreign\ngovernment or a private entity, commercial (i.e., privateto-private)\nbribery may still violate the FCPA’s accounting\nprovisions, the Travel Act, anti-money laundering laws, and\nother federal or foreign laws. Any type of corrupt payment\nthus carries a risk of prosecution.\nPublic International Organizations\nIn 1998, the FCPA was amended to expand the definition\nof “foreign official” to include employees and representatives\nof public international organizations. 127 A “public international\norganization” is any organization designated as such\nby Executive Order under the International Organizations\nImmunities Act, 22 U.S.C. § 288, or any other organization\nthat the President so designates. 128 Currently, public international\norganizations include entities such as the World Bank,\nthe International Monetary Fund, the World Intellectual\nProperty Organization, the World Trade Organization, the\nOECD, the Organization of American States, and numerous\nothers. A comprehensive list of organizations designated\nas “public international organizations” is contained in 22\nU.S.C. § 288 and can also be found on the U.S. Government\nPrinting Office website at http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/.\nHow Are Payments to Third Parties\nTreated?\nThe FCPA expressly prohibits corrupt payments\nmade through third parties or intermediaries. 129 Specifically,\nit covers payments made to “any person, while knowing\nthat all or a portion of such money or thing of value will\nbe offered, given, or promised, directly or indirectly,” 130 to a\nforeign official. Many companies doing business in a foreign\ncountry retain a local individual or company to help them\nconduct business. Although these foreign agents may provide\nentirely legitimate advice regarding local customs and\nprocedures and may help facilitate business transactions,\n21\ncompanies should be aware of the risks involved in engaging\nthird-party agents or intermediaries. The fact that a\nbribe is paid by a third party does not eliminate the potential\nfor criminal or civil FCPA liability. 131\nFor instance, a four-company joint venture used\ntwo agents—a British lawyer and a Japanese trading\ncompany—to bribe Nigerian government officials in\norder to win a series of liquefied natural gas construction\nprojects. 132 Together, the four multi-national corporations\nand the Japanese trading company paid a\ncombined $1.7 billion in civil and criminal sanctions\nfor their decade-long bribery scheme. In addition, the\nsubsidiary of one of the companies pleaded guilty and a\nnumber of individuals, including the British lawyer and\nthe former CEO of one of the companies’ subsidiaries,\nreceived significant prison terms.\nSimilarly, a medical device manufacturer entered into\na deferred prosecution agreement as the result of corrupt\npayments it authorized its local Chinese distributor to pay\nto Chinese officials. 133 Another company, a manufacturer\nof specialty chemicals, committed multiple FCPA violations\nthrough its agents in Iraq: a Canadian national and\nthe Canadian’s companies. Among other acts, the Canadian\nnational paid and promised to pay more than $1.5 million\nin bribes to officials of the Iraqi Ministry of Oil to secure\nsales of a fuel additive. Both the company and the Canadian\nnational pleaded guilty to criminal charges and resolved\ncivil enforcement actions by SEC. 134\nIn another case, the U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight\nforwarding company was charged with paying bribes on\nbehalf of its customers in several countries. 135 Although the\nU.S. subsidiary was not an issuer under the FCPA, it was an\n“agent” of several U.S. issuers and was thus charged directly\nwith violating the FCPA. Charges against the freight forwarding\ncompany and seven of its customers resulted in\nover $236.5 million in sanctions. 136\nBecause Congress anticipated the use of third-party\nagents in bribery schemes—for example, to avoid actual\nknowledge of a bribe—it defined the term “knowing” in a\nway that prevents individuals and businesses from avoiding\nliability by putting “any person” between themselves and\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nthe foreign officials. 137 Under the FCPA, a person’s state of\nmind is “knowing” with respect to conduct, a circumstance,\nor a result if the person:\n• is aware that [he] is engaging in such conduct,\nthat such circumstance exists, or that such result is\nsubstantially certain to occur; or\n• has a firm belief that such circumstance exists or\nthat such result is substantially certain to occur. 138\nThus, a person has the requisite knowledge when he is\naware of a high probability of the existence of such circumstance,\nunless the person actually believes that such circumstance\ndoes not exist. 139 As Congress made clear, it meant to\nimpose liability not only on those with actual knowledge\nof wrongdoing, but also on those who purposefully avoid\nactual knowledge:\n[T]he so-called “head-in-the-sand” problem—variously\ndescribed in the pertinent authorities as “conscious\ndisregard,” “willful blindness” or “deliberate\nignorance”—should be covered so that management\nofficials could not take refuge from the Act’s prohibitions\nby their unwarranted obliviousness to any\naction (or inaction), language or other “signaling device”\nthat should reasonably alert them of the “high\nprobability” of an FCPA violation. 140\nCommon red flags associated with third parties include:\n• excessive commissions to third-party agents or\nconsultants;\n• unreasonably large discounts to third-party\ndistributors;\n• third-party “consulting agreements” that include\nonly vaguely described services;\n• the third-party consultant is in a different line of\nbusiness than that for which it has been engaged;\n• the third party is related to or closely associated\nwith the foreign official;\n22\n• the third party became part of the transaction at\nthe express request or insistence of the foreign\nofficial;\n• the third party is merely a shell company incorporated\nin an offshore jurisdiction; and\n• the third party requests payment to offshore\nbank accounts.\nBusinesses may reduce the FCPA risks associated\nwith third-party agents by implementing an effective compliance\nprogram, which includes due diligence of any prospective\nforeign agents.\nUnited States v. Kozeny, et al.\nIn December 2011, the U.S. Court of Appeals\nfor the Second Circuit upheld a conscious avoidance\ninstruction given during the 2009 trial of a businessman\nwho was convicted of conspiring to violate the FCPA’s\nanti-bribery provisions by agreeing to make payments to\nAzeri officials in a scheme to encourage the privatization\nof the Azerbaijan Republic’s state oil company. The\ncourt of appeals found that the instruction did not lack\na factual predicate, citing evidence and testimony at\ntrial demonstrating that the defendant knew corruption\nwas pervasive in Azerbaijan; that he was aware of his\nbusiness partner’s reputation for misconduct; that he\nhad created two U.S. companies in order to shield\nhimself and other investors from potential liability for\npayments made in violation of the FCPA; and that the\ndefendant expressed concerns during a conference call\nabout whether his business partner and company were\nbribing officials.\nThe court of appeals also rejected the defendant’s\ncontention that the conscious avoidance charge had\nimproperly permitted the jury to convict him based on\nnegligence, explaining that ample evidence in the record\nshowed that the defendant had “serious concerns”\nabout the legality of his partner’s business practices\n“and worked to avoid learning exactly what [he] was\ndoing,” and noting that the district court had specifically\ninstructed the jury not to convict based on negligence.\nWhat Affirmative Defenses Are\nAvailable?\nThe FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions contain two affirmative\ndefenses: (1) that the payment was lawful under the\nwritten laws of the foreign country (the “local law” defense),\nand (2) that the money was spent as part of demonstrating a\nproduct or performing a contractual obligation (the “reasonable\nand bona fide business expenditure” defense). Because\nthese are affirmative defenses, the defendant bears the burden\nof proving them.\nThe Local Law Defense\nFor the local law defense to apply, a defendant must\nestablish that “the payment, gift, offer, or promise of anything\nof value that was made, was lawful under the written\nlaws and regulations of the foreign official’s, political\nparty’s, party official’s, or candidate’s country.” 141 The defendant\nmust establish that the payment was lawful under the\nforeign country’s written laws and regulations at the time\nof the offense. In creating the local law defense in 1988,\nCongress sought “to make clear that the absence of written\nlaws in a foreign official’s country would not by itself be sufficient\nto satisfy this defense.” 142 Thus, the fact that bribes\nmay not be prosecuted under local law is insufficient to\nestablish the defense. In practice, the local law defense arises\ninfrequently, as the written laws and regulations of countries\nrarely, if ever, permit corrupt payments. Nevertheless,\nif a defendant can establish that conduct that otherwise\nfalls within the scope of the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions\nwas lawful under written, local law, he or she would have a\ndefense to prosecution.\nIn United States v. Kozeny, the defendant unsuccessfully\nsought to assert the local law defense regarding the law\nof Azerbaijan. The parties disputed the contents and applicability\nof Azeri law, and each presented expert reports and\ntestimony on behalf of their conflicting interpretations. The\ncourt ruled that the defendant could not invoke the FCPA’s\naffirmative defense because Azeri law did not actually legalize\nthe bribe payment. The court concluded that an exception\nunder Azeri law relieving bribe payors who voluntarily\n23\ndisclose bribe payments to the authorities of criminal liability\ndid not make the bribes legal. 143\nReasonable and Bona Fide Expenditures\nThe FCPA allows companies to provide reasonable\nand bona fide travel and lodging expenses to a foreign\nofficial, and it is an affirmative defense where expenses\nare directly related to the promotion, demonstration, or\nexplanation of a company’s products or services, or are\nrelated to a company’s execution or performance of a contract\nwith a foreign government or agency. 144 Trips that\nare primarily for personal entertainment purposes, however,\nare not bona fide business expenses and may violate\nthe FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions. 145 Moreover, when\nexpenditures, bona fide or not, are mischaracterized in a\ncompany’s books and records, or where unauthorized or\nimproper expenditures occur due to a failure to implement\nadequate internal controls, they may also violate\nthe FCPA’s accounting provisions. Purposeful mischaracterization\nof expenditures may also, of course, indicate a\ncorrupt intent.\nDOJ and SEC have consistently recognized that businesses,\nboth foreign and domestic, are permitted to pay for\nreasonable expenses associated with the promotion of their\nproducts and services or the execution of existing contracts.\nIn addition, DOJ has frequently provided guidance about\nlegitimate promotional and contract-related expenses—\naddressing travel and lodging expenses in particular—\nthrough several opinion procedure releases. Under the circumstances\npresented in those releases, 146 DOJ opined that\nthe following types of expenditures on behalf of foreign\nofficials did not warrant FCPA enforcement action:\n• travel and expenses to visit company facilities or\noperations;\n• travel and expenses for training; and\n• product demonstration or promotional activities,\nincluding travel and expenses for meetings.\nWhether any particular payment is a bona fide expenditure\nnecessarily requires a fact-specific analysis. But the\nfollowing non-exhaustive list of safeguards, compiled from\nseveral releases, may be helpful to businesses in evaluating\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nwhether a particular expenditure is appropriate or may risk\nviolating the FCPA:\n• Do not select the particular officials who will participate\nin the party’s proposed trip or program 147\nor else select them based on pre-determined, meritbased\ncriteria. 148\n• Pay all costs directly to travel and lodging vendors\nand/or reimburse costs only upon presentation of a\nreceipt. 149\n• Do not advance funds or pay for reimbursements\nin cash. 150\n• Ensure that any stipends are reasonable approximations\nof costs likely to be incurred 151 and/or that\nexpenses are limited to those that are necessary and\nreasonable. 152\n• Ensure the expenditures are transparent,\nboth within the company and to the foreign\ngovernment. 153\n• Do not condition payment of expenses on any\naction by the foreign official. 154\n• Obtain written confirmation that payment of the\nexpenses is not contrary to local law. 155\n• Provide no additional compensation, stipends, or\nspending money beyond what is necessary to pay\nfor actual expenses incurred. 156\n• Ensure that costs and expenses on behalf of the\nforeign officials will be accurately recorded in the\ncompany’s books and records. 157\nIn sum, while certain expenditures are more likely to\nraise red flags, they will not give rise to prosecution if they\nare (1) reasonable, (2) bona fide, and (3) directly related\nto (4) the promotion, demonstration, or explanation of\nproducts or services or the execution or performance of\na contract. 158\n24\nWhat Are Facilitating or Expediting\nPayments?\nThe FCPA’s bribery prohibition contains a narrow\nexception for “facilitating or expediting payments” made in\nfurtherance of routine governmental action. 159 The facilitating\npayments exception applies only when a payment is\nmade to further “routine governmental action” that involves\nnon-discretionary acts. 160 Examples of “routine governmental\naction” include processing visas, providing police protection\nor mail service, and supplying utilities like phone\nservice, power, and water. Routine government action does\nnot include a decision to award new business or to continue\nbusiness with a particular party. 161 Nor does it include acts\nthat are within an official’s discretion or that would constitute\nmisuse of an official’s office. 162 Thus, paying an official a\nsmall amount to have the power turned on at a factory might\nbe a facilitating payment; paying an inspector to ignore the\nfact that the company does not have a valid permit to operate\nthe factory would not be a facilitating payment.\nExamples of “Routine Governmental Action”\nAn action which is ordinarily and commonly\nperformed by a foreign official in—\n• obtaining permits, licenses, or other official\ndocuments to qualify a person to do business in a\nforeign country;\n• processing governmental papers, such as visas and\nwork orders;\n• providing police protection, mail pickup and\ndelivery, or scheduling inspections associated with\ncontract performance or inspections related to\ntransit of goods across country;\n• providing phone service, power and water supply,\nloading and unloading cargo, or protecting\nperishable products or commodities from\ndeterioration; or\n• actions of a similar nature.\nWhether a payment falls within the exception is not\ndependent on the size of the payment, though size can be\ntelling, as a large payment is more suggestive of corrupt\nintent to influence a non-routine governmental action. But,\nlike the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions more generally, the\nfacilitating payments exception focuses on the purpose of the\npayment rather than its value. For instance, an Oklahomabased\ncorporation violated the FCPA when its subsidiary\npaid Argentine customs officials approximately $166,000\nto secure customs clearance for equipment and materials\nthat lacked required certifications or could not be imported\nunder local law and to pay a lower-than-applicable duty\nrate. The company’s Venezuelan subsidiary had also paid\nVenezuelan customs officials approximately $7,000 to permit\nthe importation and exportation of equipment and materials\nnot in compliance with local regulations and to avoid a full\ninspection of the imported goods. 163 In another case, three\nsubsidiaries of a global supplier of oil drilling products and\nservices were criminally charged with authorizing an agent to\nmake at least 378 corrupt payments (totaling approximately\n$2.1 million) to Nigerian Customs Service officials for preferential\ntreatment during the customs process, including the\nreduction or elimination of customs duties. 164\nLabeling a bribe as a “facilitating payment” in a company’s\nbooks and records does not make it one. A Swiss\noffshore drilling company, for example, recorded payments\nto its customs agent in the subsidiary’s “facilitating\npayment” account, even though company personnel\nbelieved the payments were, in fact, bribes. The company\nwas charged with violating both the FCPA’s anti-bribery\nand accounting provisions. 165\nAlthough true facilitating payments are not illegal\nunder the FCPA, they may still violate local law in the\ncountries where the company is operating, and the OECD’s\nWorking Group on Bribery recommends that all countries\nencourage companies to prohibit or discourage facilitating\npayments, which the United States has done regularly. 166\nIn addition, other countries’ foreign bribery laws, such as\nthe United Kingdom’s, may not contain an exception for\nfacilitating payments. 167 Individuals and companies should\ntherefore be aware that although true facilitating payments\n25\nare permissible under the FCPA, they may still subject a\ncompany or individual to sanctions. As with any expenditure,\nfacilitating payments may still violate the FCPA if they are\nnot properly recorded in an issuer’s books and records. 168\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nHypothetical: Facilitating Payments\nCompany A is a large multi-national mining company with operations in Foreign Country, where it recently identified\na significant new ore deposit It has ready buyers for the new ore but has limited capacity to get it to market In order to\nincrease the size and speed of its ore export, Company A will need to build a new road from its facility to the port that can\naccommodate larger trucks Company A retains an agent in Foreign Country to assist it in obtaining the required permits,\nincluding an environmental permit, to build the road The agent informs Company A’s vice president for international\noperations that he plans to make a one-time small cash payment to a clerk in the relevant government office to ensure\nthat the clerk files and stamps the permit applications expeditiously, as the agent has experienced delays of three months\nwhen he has not made this “grease” payment The clerk has no discretion about whether to file and stamp the permit\napplications once the requisite filing fee has been paid The vice president authorizes the payment\nA few months later, the agent tells the vice president that he has run into a problem obtaining a necessary environmental\npermit. It turns out that the planned road construction would adversely impact an environmentally sensitive and protected\nlocal wetland. While the problem could be overcome by rerouting the road, such rerouting would cost Company A $1\nmillion more and would slow down construction by six months. It would also increase the transit time for the ore and\nreduce the number of monthly shipments. The agent tells the vice president that he is good friends with the director of\nForeign Country’s Department of Natural Resources and that it would only take a modest cash payment to the director\nand the “problem would go away.” The vice president authorizes the payment, and the agent makes it. After receiving the\npayment, the director issues the permit, and Company A constructs its new road through the wetlands.\nWas the payment to the clerk a violation of the FCPA?\nNo. Under these circumstances, the payment to the clerk would qualify as a facilitating payment, since it is a one-time,\nsmall payment to obtain a routine, non-discretionary governmental service that Company A is entitled to receive (i.e., the\nstamping and filing of the permit application). However, while the payment may qualify as an exception to the FCPA’s\nanti-bribery provisions, it may violate other laws, both in Foreign Country and elsewhere. In addition, if the payment is not\naccurately recorded, it could violate the FCPA’s books and records provision.\nWas the payment to the director a violation of the FCPA?\nYes. The payment to the director of the Department of Natural Resources was in clear violation of the FCPA, since it\nwas designed to corruptly influence a foreign official into improperly approving a permit. The issuance of the environmental\npermit was a discretionary act, and indeed, Company A should not have received it. Company A, its vice president, and the\nlocal agent may all be prosecuted for authorizing and paying the bribe.\n26\nDoes the FCPA Apply to Cases of\nExtortion or Duress?\nSituations involving extortion or duress will not give\nrise to FCPA liability because a payment made in response to\ntrue extortionate demands under imminent threat of physical\nharm cannot be said to have been made with corrupt intent\nor for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business. 169 In\nenacting the FCPA, Congress recognized that real-world\nsituations might arise in which a business is compelled to pay\nan official in order to avoid threats to health and safety. As\nCongress explained, “a payment to an official to keep an oil\nrig from being dynamited should not be held to be made with\nthe requisite corrupt purpose.” 170\nMere economic coercion, however, does not amount to\nextortion. As Congress noted when it enacted the FCPA:\n“The defense that the payment was demanded on the part of\na government official as a price for gaining entry into a market\nor to obtain a contract would not suffice since at some\npoint the U.S. company would make a conscious decision\nwhether or not to pay a bribe.” 171 The fact that the payment\nwas “first proposed by the recipient … does not alter the corrupt\npurpose on the part of the person paying the bribe.” 172\nThis distinction between extortion and economic coercion\nwas recognized by the court in United States v. Kozeny.\nThere, the court concluded that although an individual who\nmakes a payment under duress (i.e., upon threat of physical\nharm) will not be criminally liable under the FCPA, 173 a\nbribe payor who claims payment was demanded as a price for\ngaining market entry or obtaining a contract “cannot argue\nthat he lacked the intent to bribe the official because he made\nthe ‘conscious decision’ to pay the official.” 174 While the\nbribe payor in this situation “could have turned his back and\nwalked away,” in the oil rig example, “he could not.” 175\nBusinesses operating in high-risk countries may face\nreal threats of violence or harm to their employees, and\npayments made in response to imminent threats to health\nor safety do not violate the FCPA. 176 If such a situation\narises, and to ensure the safety of its employees, companies\nshould immediately contact the appropriate U.S. embassy\nfor assistance.\nPrinciples of Corporate Liability for\nAnti-Bribery Violations\nGeneral principles of corporate liability apply to the\nFCPA. Thus, a company is liable when its directors, officers,\nemployees, or agents, acting within the scope of their employment,\ncommit FCPA violations intended, at least in part, to\nbenefit the company. 177 Similarly, just as with any other statute,\nDOJ and SEC look to principles of parent-subsidiary\nand successor liability in evaluating corporate liability.\nParent-Subsidiary Liability\nThere are two ways in which a parent company may\nbe liable for bribes paid by its subsidiary. First, a parent may\nhave participated sufficiently in the activity to be directly\nliable for the conduct—as, for example, when it directed its\nsubsidiary’s misconduct or otherwise directly participated\nin the bribe scheme.\nSecond, a parent may be liable for its subsidiary’s conduct\nunder traditional agency principles. The fundamental\ncharacteristic of agency is control. 178 Accordingly, DOJ and\nSEC evaluate the parent’s control—including the parent’s\nknowledge and direction of the subsidiary’s actions, both\ngenerally and in the context of the specific transaction—\nwhen evaluating whether a subsidiary is an agent of the parent.\nAlthough the formal relationship between the parent\nand subsidiary is important in this analysis, so are the practical\nrealities of how the parent and subsidiary actually interact.\nIf an agency relationship exists, a subsidiary’s actions\nand knowledge are imputed to its parent. 179 Moreover,\nunder traditional principles of respondeat superior, a company\nis liable for the acts of its agents, including its employees,\nundertaken within the scope of their employment and\nintended, at least in part, to benefit the company. 180 Thus,\nif an agency relationship exists between a parent and a\nsubsidiary, the parent is liable for bribery committed by\nthe subsidiary’s employees. For example, SEC brought an\nadministrative action against a parent for bribes paid by the\npresident of its indirect, wholly owned subsidiary. In that\nmatter, the subsidiary’s president reported directly to the\nCEO of the parent issuer, and the issuer routinely identified\n27\nthe president as a member of its senior management in its\nannual filing with SEC and in annual reports. Additionally,\nthe parent’s legal department approved the retention of the\nthird-party agent through whom the bribes were arranged\ndespite a lack of documented due diligence and an agency\nagreement that violated corporate policy; also, an official of\nthe parent approved one of the payments to the third-party\nagent. 181 Under these circumstances, the parent company\nhad sufficient knowledge and control of its subsidiary’s\nactions to be liable under the FCPA.\nSuccessor Liability\nCompanies acquire a host of liabilities when they\nmerge with or acquire another company, including those arising\nout of contracts, torts, regulations, and statutes. As a general\nlegal matter, when a company merges with or acquires\nanother company, the successor company assumes the predecessor\ncompany’s liabilities. 182 Successor liability is an integral\ncomponent of corporate law and, among other things, prevents\ncompanies from avoiding liability by reorganizing. 183\nSuccessor liability applies to all kinds of civil and criminal\nliabilities, 184 and FCPA violations are no exception. Whether\nsuccessor liability applies to a particular corporate transaction\ndepends on the facts and the applicable state, federal,\nand foreign law. Successor liability does not, however, create\nliability where none existed before. For example, if an issuer\nwere to acquire a foreign company that was not previously\nsubject to the FCPA’s jurisdiction, the mere acquisition of\nthat foreign company would not retroactively create FCPA\nliability for the acquiring issuer.\nDOJ and SEC encourage companies to conduct preacquisition\ndue diligence and improve compliance programs\nand internal controls after acquisition for a variety\nof reasons. First, due diligence helps an acquiring company\nto accurately value the target company. Contracts obtained\nthrough bribes may be legally unenforceable, business\nobtained illegally may be lost when bribe payments are\nstopped, there may be liability for prior illegal conduct, and\nthe prior corrupt acts may harm the acquiring company’s\nreputation and future business prospects. Identifying these\nissues before an acquisition allows companies to better\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nevaluate any potential post-acquisition liability and thus\nproperly assess the target’s value. 185 Second, due diligence\nreduces the risk that the acquired company will continue to\npay bribes. Proper pre-acquisition due diligence can identify\nbusiness and regional risks and can also lay the foundation\nfor a swift and successful post-acquisition integration\ninto the acquiring company’s corporate control and compliance\nenvironment. Third, the consequences of potential\nviolations uncovered through due diligence can be handled\nby the parties in an orderly and efficient manner through\nnegotiation of the costs and responsibilities for the investigation\nand remediation. Finally, comprehensive due diligence\ndemonstrates a genuine commitment to uncovering\nand preventing FCPA violations.\nIn a significant number of instances, DOJ and\nSEC have declined to take action against companies\nthat voluntarily disclosed and remediated conduct\nand cooperated with DOJ and SEC in the merger and\nacquisition context. 186 And DOJ and SEC have only\ntaken action against successor companies in limited circumstances,\ngenerally in cases involving egregious and\nsustained violations or where the successor company\ndirectly participated in the violations or failed to stop the\nmisconduct from continuing after the acquisition. In one\ncase, a U.S.-based issuer was charged with books and records\nand internal controls violations for continuing a kickback\nscheme originated by its predecessor. 187 Another recent case\ninvolved a merger between two tobacco leaf merchants,\nwhere prior to the merger each company committed\nFCPA violations through its foreign subsidiaries, involving\nmultiple countries over the course of many years. At each\ncompany, the bribes were directed by the parent company’s\nsenior management. The two issuers then merged to form\na new public company. Under these circumstances—the\nmerger of two public companies that had each engaged in\n28\nPractical Tips to Reduce FCPA Risk in Mergers and Acquisitions\nCompanies pursuing mergers or acquisitions can take certain steps to identify and potentially reduce FCPA risks:\n• M&A Opinion Procedure Release Requests: One option is to seek an opinion from DOJ in anticipation of a\npotential acquisition, such as occurred with Opinion Release 08-02 That case involved special circumstances,\nnamely, severely limited pre-acquisition due diligence available to the potential acquiring company, and, because\nit was an opinion release (i e , providing certain assurances by DOJ concerning prospective conduct), it necessarily\nimposed demanding standards and prescriptive timeframes in return for specific assurances from DOJ, which\nSEC, as a matter of discretion, also honors Thus, obtaining an opinion from DOJ can be a good way to address\nspecific due diligence challenges, but, because of the nature of such an opinion, it will likely contain more stringent\nrequirements than may be necessary in all circumstances\n• M&A Risk-Based FCPA Due Diligence and Disclosure: As a practical matter, most acquisitions will typically not\nrequire the type of prospective assurances contained in an opinion from DOJ DOJ and SEC encourage companies\nengaging in mergers and acquisitions to: (1) conduct thorough risk-based FCPA and anti-corruption due diligence\non potential new business acquisitions; (2) ensure that the acquiring company’s code of conduct and compliance\npolicies and procedures regarding the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws apply as quickly as is practicable to\nnewly acquired businesses or merged entities; (3) train the directors, officers, and employees of newly acquired\nbusinesses or merged entities, and when appropriate, train agents and business partners, on the FCPA and other\nrelevant anti-corruption laws and the company’s code of conduct and compliance policies and procedures; (4)\nconduct an FCPA-specific audit of all newly acquired or merged businesses as quickly as practicable; and (5) disclose\nany corrupt payments discovered as part of its due diligence of newly acquired entities or merged entities DOJ\nand SEC will give meaningful credit to companies who undertake these actions, and, in appropriate circumstances,\nDOJ and SEC may consequently decline to bring enforcement actions\nbribery—both the new entity and the foreign subsidiaries\nwere liable under the FCPA. The new parent entered into\na non-prosecution agreement with DOJ and settled a civil\naction with SEC, while the company’s subsidiaries, which\nalso merged, pleaded guilty. 188\nMore often, DOJ and SEC have pursued enforcement\nactions against the predecessor company (rather\nthan the acquiring company), particularly when the\nacquiring company uncovered and timely remedied the\nviolations or when the government’s investigation of\nthe predecessor company preceded the acquisition. In\none such case, an Ohio-based health care company’s due\ndiligence of an acquisition target uncovered FCPA violations\nby the target’s subsidiary, and, before the merger\nwas completed, the subsidiary’s violations were disclosed\nto DOJ and SEC. The subsidiary pleaded guilty and\npaid a $2 million criminal fine, 189 the acquisition target\nsettled with SEC and paid a $500,000 civil penalty, 190\nand no successor liability was sought against the acquiring\nentity. In another case, a Pennsylvania-based issuer\nthat supplied heating and air conditioning products and\nservices was subject to an ongoing investigation by DOJ\nand SEC at the time that it was acquired; DOJ and SEC\nresolved enforcement actions only against the predecessor\ncompany, which had by that time become a wholly owned\nsubsidiary of the successor company. 191\nDOJ and SEC have also brought actions only against a\npredecessor company where its FCPA violations are discovered\nafter acquisition. For example, when a Florida-based\nU.S. company discovered in post-acquisition due diligence\nthat the telecommunications company (a domestic concern)\nit had acquired had engaged in foreign bribery, the\nsuccessor company disclosed the FCPA violations to DOJ.\nIt then conducted an internal investigation, cooperated\nfully with DOJ, and took appropriate remedial action—\nincluding terminating senior management at the acquired\n29\ncompany. No enforcement action was taken against the successor,\nbut the predecessor company pleaded guilty to one\ncount of violating the FCPA and agreed to pay a $2 million\nfine. 192 Later, four executives from the predecessor company\nwere convicted of FCPA violations, three of whom received\nterms of imprisonment. 193\nOn occasion, when an enforcement action has\nbeen taken against a predecessor company, the successor\nseeks assurances that it will not be subject to a future\nenforcement action. In one such case, a Dutch predecessor\nresolved FCPA charges with DOJ through a deferred\nprosecution agreement. 194 While both the predecessor\nand successor signed the agreement, which included a\ncommitment to ongoing cooperation and an improved\ncompliance program, only the predecessor company was\ncharged; in signing the agreement, the successor company\ngained the certainty of conditional release from criminal\nliability, even though it was not being pursued for FCPA\nviolations. 195 In another case, after a Connecticut-based\ncompany uncovered FCPA violations by a California\ncompany it sought to acquire, both companies voluntarily\ndisclosed the conduct to DOJ and SEC. 196 The predecessor\ncompany resolved its criminal liability through a\nnon-prosecution agreement with DOJ that included an\n$800,000 monetary penalty and also settled with SEC,\npaying a total of $1.1 million in disgorgement, pre-judgment\ninterest, and civil penalties. The successor company\nproceeded with the acquisition and separately entered\ninto a non-prosecution agreement with DOJ in which it\nagreed, among other things, to ensure full performance of\nthe predecessor company’s non-prosecution agreement.\nThis agreement provided certainty to the successor concerning\nits FCPA liability. 197\nImportantly, a successor company’s voluntary disclosure,\nappropriate due diligence, and implementation of an\neffective compliance program may also decrease the likelihood\nof an enforcement action regarding an acquired company’s\npost-acquisition conduct when pre-acquisition due\ndiligence is not possible. 198\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\n30\nHypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Not Previously\nSubject to the FCPA\nCompany A is a Delaware corporation with its principal offices in the United States and whose shares are listed on\na national U.S. exchange. Company A is considering acquiring Foreign Company, which is not an issuer or a domestic\nconcern. Foreign Company takes no actions within the United States that would make it subject to territorial jurisdiction.\nCompany A’s proposed acquisition would make Foreign Company a subsidiary of Company A.\nScenario 1:\nPrior to acquiring Foreign Company, Company A engages in extensive due diligence of Foreign Company, including: (1)\nhaving its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Foreign Company’s sales and financial data, its customer\ncontracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based analysis of Foreign Company’s customer\nbase; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Foreign Company; and (4) engaging in discussions\nwith Foreign Company’s general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding all corruption risks,\ncompliance efforts, and any other corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Foreign Company over the past ten years.\nThis due diligence aims to determine whether Foreign Company has appropriate anti-corruption and compliance policies\nin place, whether Foreign Company’s employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies, how Foreign\nCompany ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated.\nDuring the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Foreign Company has made several potentially\nimproper payments in the form of an inflated commission to a third-party agent in connection with a government contract\nwith Foreign Country. Immediately after the acquisition, Company A discloses the conduct to DOJ and SEC, suspends\nand terminates those employees and the third-party agent responsible for the payments, and makes certain that the\nillegal payments have stopped. It also quickly integrates Foreign Company into Company A’s own robust internal controls,\nincluding its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online\nand in-person training in the local language. Company A also requires Foreign Company’s third-party distributors and other\nagents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anticorruption\nrepresentations and warranties and audit rights.\nBased on these facts, could DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A?\nNo. Although DOJ and SEC have jurisdiction over Company A because it is an issuer, neither could pursue Company\nA for conduct that occurred prior to its acquisition of Foreign Company. As Foreign Company was neither an issuer nor a\ndomestic concern and was not subject to U.S. territorial jurisdiction, DOJ and SEC have no jurisdiction over its pre-acquisition\nmisconduct. The acquisition of a company does not create jurisdiction where none existed before.\nImportantly, Company A’s extensive pre-acquisition due diligence allowed it to identify and halt the corruption. As\nthere was no continuing misconduct post-acquisition, the FCPA was not violated.\nScenario 2:\nCompany A performs only minimal and pro forma pre-acquisition due diligence. It does not conduct a risk-based\nanalysis, and its review of Foreign Company’s data, contracts, and third-party and distributor agreements is cursory.\nCompany A acquires Foreign Company and makes it a wholly owned subsidiary. Although Company A circulates its\ncompliance policies to all new personnel after the acquisition, it does not translate the compliance policies into the local\nlanguage or train its new personnel or third-party agents on anti-corruption issues.\nA few months after the acquisition, an employee in Company A’s international sales office (Sales Employee) learns\nfrom a legacy Foreign Company employee that for years the government contract that generated most of Foreign\nCompany’s revenues depended on inflated commissions to a third-party agent “to make the right person happy at Foreign\nGovernment Agency.” Sales Employee is told that unless the payments continue the business will likely be lost, which\nwould mean that Company A’s new acquisition would quickly become a financial failure. The payments continue for two\n(cont’d)\n31\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\nyears after the acquisition. After another employee of Company A reports the long-running bribe scheme to a director at\nForeign Government Agency, Company A stops the payments and DOJ and SEC investigate.\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC charge Company A?\nYes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company A in similar circumstances. Any charges would not,\nhowever, be premised upon successor liability, but rather on Company A’s post-acquisition bribe payments, which\nthemselves created criminal and civil liability for Company A.\nScenario 3:\nUnder local law, Company A’s ability to conduct pre-acquisition due diligence on Foreign Company is limited. In the\ndue diligence it does conduct, Company A determines that Foreign Company is doing business in high-risk countries\nand in high-risk industries but finds no red flags specific to Foreign Company’s operations. Post-acquisition, Company\nA conducts extensive due diligence and determines that Foreign Company had paid bribes to officials with Foreign\nGovernment Agency. Company A takes prompt action to remediate the problem, including following the measures set\nforth in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02. Among other actions, it voluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and\nSEC, ensures all bribes are immediately stopped, takes remedial action against all parties involved in the corruption, and\nquickly incorporates Foreign Company into a robust compliance program and Company A’s other internal controls.\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute Company A?\nDOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances Companies can follow\nthe measures set forth in Opinion Procedure Release No 08-02, or seek their own opinions, where adequate pre-acquisition\ndue diligence is not possible\nHypothetical: Successor Liability Where Acquired Company Was Already Subject to\nthe FCPA\nBoth Company A and Company B are Delaware corporations with their principal offices in the United States Both\ncompanies’ shares are listed on a national U S exchange\nScenario 1:\nCompany A is considering acquiring several of Company B’s business lines. Prior to the acquisition, Company A engages\nin extensive due diligence, including: (1) having its legal, accounting, and compliance departments review Company B’s\nsales and financial data, its customer contracts, and its third-party and distributor agreements; (2) performing a risk-based\nanalysis of Company B’s customer base; (3) performing an audit of selected transactions engaged in by Company B; and\n(4) engaging in discussions with Company B’s general counsel, vice president of sales, and head of internal audit regarding\nall corruption risks, compliance efforts, and any other major corruption-related issues that have surfaced at Company B\nover the past ten years. This due diligence aims to determine whether Company B has appropriate anti-corruption and\ncompliance policies in place, whether Company B’s employees have been adequately trained regarding those policies,\nhow Company B ensures that those policies are followed, and what remedial actions are taken if the policies are violated.\nDuring the course of its due diligence, Company A learns that Company B has made several potentially improper\npayments in connection with a government contract with Foreign Country. As a condition of the acquisition, Company A\nrequires Company B to disclose the misconduct to the government. Company A makes certain that the illegal payments\n(cont’d)\n32\nhave stopped and quickly integrates Company B’s business lines into Company A’s own robust internal controls, including\nits anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required online and inperson\ntraining in the local language. Company A also requires Company B’s third-party distributors and other agents to\nsign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anti-corruption\nrepresentations and warranties and audit rights.\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?\nDOJ and SEC have declined to prosecute companies like Company A in similar circumstances. DOJ and SEC\nencourage companies like Company A to conduct extensive FCPA due diligence. By uncovering the corruption, Company\nA put itself in a favorable position, and, because the corrupt payments have stopped, Company A has no continuing\nliability. Whether DOJ and SEC might charge Company B depends on facts and circumstances beyond the scope of this\nhypothetical. DOJ would consider its Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations and SEC would consider\nthe factors contained in the Seaboard Report, both of which are discussed in Chapter 5. In general, the more egregious\nand long-standing the corruption, the more likely it is that DOJ and SEC would prosecute Company B. In certain limited\ncircumstances, DOJ and SEC have in the past declined to bring charges against acquired companies, recognizing that\nacquiring companies may bear much of the reputational damage and costs associated with such charges.\nScenario 2:\nCompany A plans to acquire Company B Although, as in Scenario 1, Company A conducts extensive due diligence, it\ndoes not uncover the bribery until after the acquisition Company A then makes certain that the illegal payments stop and\nvoluntarily discloses the misconduct to DOJ and SEC It quickly integrates Company B into Company A’s own robust internal\ncontrols, including its anti-corruption and compliance policies, which it communicates to its new employees through required\nonline and in-person training in the local language Company A also requires Company B’s third-party distributors and other\nagents to sign anti-corruption certifications, complete training, and sign new contracts that incorporate FCPA and anticorruption\nrepresentations and warranties and audit rights\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?\nAbsent unusual circumstances not contemplated by this hypothetical, DOJ and SEC are unlikely to prosecute\nCompany A for the pre-acquisition misconduct of Company B, provided that Company B still exists in a form that would\nallow it to be prosecuted separately (e.g., Company B is a subsidiary of Company A). DOJ and SEC understand that no\ndue diligence is perfect and that society benefits when companies with strong compliance programs acquire and improve\ncompanies with weak ones. At the same time, however, neither the liability for corruption—nor the harms caused by it—\nare eliminated when one company acquires another. Whether DOJ and SEC will pursue a case against Company B (or, in\nunusual circumstances, Company A) will depend on consideration of all the factors in the Principles of Federal Prosecution\nof Business Organizations and the Seaboard Report, respectively.\nScenario 3:\nCompany A merges with Company B, which is in the same line of business and interacts with the same Foreign\nGovernment customers, and forms Company C Due diligence before the merger reveals that both Company A and\nCompany B have been engaging in similar bribery In both cases, the bribery was extensive and known by high-level\nmanagement within the companies\nBased on these facts, would DOJ or SEC prosecute?\nYes. DOJ and SEC have prosecuted companies like Company C on the basis of successor liability. Company C is a\ncombination of two companies that both violated the FCPA, and their merger does not eliminate their liability. In addition,\nsince Company C is an ongoing concern, DOJ and SEC may impose a monitorship to ensure that the bribery has ceased\nand a compliance program is developed to prevent future misconduct.\n33\nAdditional Principles of Criminal\nLiability for Anti-Bribery Violations:\nAiding and Abetting and Conspiracy\nUnder federal law, individuals or companies that aid\nor abet a crime, including an FCPA violation, are as guilty as\nif they had directly committed the offense themselves. The\naiding and abetting statute provides that whoever “commits\nan offense against the United States or aids, abets, counsels,\ncommands, induces or procures its commission,” or “willfully\ncauses an act to be done which if directly performed\nby him or another would be an offense against the United\nStates,” is punishable as a principal. 199 Aiding and abetting is\nnot an independent crime, and the government must prove\nthat an underlying FCPA violation was committed. 200\nIndividuals and companies, including foreign nationals\nand companies, may also be liable for conspiring to\nviolate the FCPA—i.e., for agreeing to commit an FCPA\nviolation—even if they are not, or could not be, independently\ncharged with a substantive FCPA violation. For\ninstance, a foreign, non-issuer company could be convicted\nof conspiring with a domestic concern to violate the FCPA.\nUnder certain circumstances, it could also be held liable\nfor the domestic concern’s substantive FCPA violations\nunder Pinkerton v. United States, which imposes liability on\na defendant for reasonably foreseeable crimes committed\nby a co-conspirator in furtherance of a conspiracy that the\ndefendant joined. 201\nA foreign company or individual may be held liable\nfor aiding and abetting an FCPA violation or for conspiring\nto violate the FCPA, even if the foreign company or individual\ndid not take any act in furtherance of the corrupt\npayment while in the territory of the United States. In conspiracy\ncases, the United States generally has jurisdiction\nover all the conspirators where at least one conspirator is\nan issuer, domestic concern, or commits a reasonably foreseeable\novert act within the United States. 202 For example,\nif a foreign company or individual conspires to violate the\nFCPA with someone who commits an overt act within the\nUnited States, the United States can prosecute the foreign\ncompany or individual for the conspiracy. The same principle\napplies to aiding and abetting violations. For instance,\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\neven though they took no action in the United States,\nJapanese and European companies were charged with conspiring\nwith and aiding and abetting a domestic concern’s\nFCPA violations. 203\nAdditional Principles of Civil Liability\nfor Anti-Bribery Violations: Aiding and\nAbetting and Causing\nBoth companies and individuals can be held civilly\nliable for aiding and abetting FCPA anti-bribery violations\nif they knowingly or recklessly provide substantial assistance\nto a violator. 204 Similarly, in the administrative proceeding\ncontext, companies and individuals may be held\nliable for causing FCPA violations. 205 This liability extends\nto the subsidiaries and agents of U.S. issuers.\nIn one case, the U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight forwarding\ncompany was held civilly liable for paying bribes on\nbehalf of its customers in several countries. 206 Although the\nU.S. subsidiary was not an issuer for purposes of the FCPA,\nit was an “agent” of several U.S. issuers. By paying bribes on\nbehalf of its issuers’ customers, the subsidiary both directly\nviolated and aided and abetted the issuers’ FCPA violations.\nWhat Is the Applicable Statute of\nLimitations?\nStatute of Limitations in Criminal Cases\nThe FCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting provisions\ndo not specify a statute of limitations for criminal actions.\nAccordingly, the general five-year limitations period set\nforth in 18 U.S.C. § 3282 applies to substantive criminal\nviolations of the Act. 207\nIn cases involving FCPA conspiracies, the government\nmay be able to reach conduct occurring before the\nfive-year limitations period applicable to conspiracies\n34\nunder 18 U.S.C. § 371. For conspiracy offenses, the government\ngenerally need prove only that one act in furtherance\nof the conspiracy occurred during the limitations period,\nthus enabling the government to prosecute bribes paid or\naccounting violations occurring more than five years prior\nto the filing of formal charges. 208\nThere are at least two ways in which the applicable\nlimitations period is commonly extended. First, companies\nor individuals cooperating with DOJ may enter into\na tolling agreement that voluntarily extends the limitations\nperiod. Second, under 18 U.S.C. § 3292, the government\nmay seek a court order suspending the statute of limitations\nposed in a criminal case for up to three years in order to\nobtain evidence from foreign countries. Generally, the suspension\nperiod begins when the official request is made by\nthe U.S. government to the foreign authority and ends on\nthe date on which the foreign authority takes final action\non the request. 209\nStatute of Limitations in Civil Actions\nIn civil cases brought by SEC, the statute of limitations\nis set by 28 U.S.C. § 2462, which provides for a fiveyear\nlimitation on any “suit or proceeding for the enforcement\nof any civil fine, penalty, or forfeiture.” The five-year\nperiod begins to run “when the claim first accrued.” The\nfive-year limitations period applies to SEC actions seeking\ncivil penalties, but it does not prevent SEC from\nseeking equitable remedies, such as an injunction or the\ndisgorgement of ill-gotten gains, for conduct pre-dating\nthe five-year period. In cases against individuals who are\nnot residents of the United States, the statute is tolled for\nany period when the defendants are not “found within the\nUnited States in order that proper service may be made\nthereon.” 210 Furthermore, companies or individuals cooperating\nwith SEC may enter into tolling agreements that\nvoluntarily extend the limitations period.\n35\nchapter 2\nThe FCPA:\nAnti-Bribery Provisions\n36\n\nchapter 3\nThe FCPA:\nAccounting Provisions\nTHE FCPA: ACCOUNTING\nPROVISIONS\nIn addition to the anti-bribery provisions, the FCPA contains accounting provisions\napplicable to public companies. The FCPA’s accounting provisions operate\nin tandem with the anti-bribery provisions 211 and prohibit off-the-books\naccounting. Company management and investors rely on a company’s financial\nstatements and internal accounting controls to ensure transparency in the financial\nhealth of the business, the risks undertaken, and the transactions between\nthe company and its customers and business partners. The accounting provisions\nare designed to “strengthen the accuracy of the corporate books and\nrecords and the reliability of the audit process which constitute the foundations\nof our system of corporate disclosure.” 212\nThe accounting provisions consist of two primary\ncomponents. First, under the “books and records” provision,\nissuers must make and keep books, records, and\naccounts that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly\nreflect an issuer’s transactions and dispositions of an issuer’s\nassets. 213 Second, under the “internal controls” provision,\nissuers must devise and maintain a system of internal\naccounting controls sufficient to assure management’s control,\nauthority, and responsibility over the firm’s assets. 214\nThese components, and other aspects of the accounting\nprovisions, are discussed in greater detail below.\nAlthough the accounting provisions were originally\nenacted as part of the FCPA, they do not apply only to bribery-related\nviolations. Rather, the accounting provisions\nensure that all public companies account for all of their\nassets and liabilities accurately and in reasonable detail,\nand they form the backbone for most accounting fraud and\nissuer disclosure cases brought by DOJ and SEC. 215\n38\nIn the past, “corporate bribery has\nbeen concealed by the falsification of\ncorporate books and records” and the\naccounting provisions “remove[] this\navenue of coverup.”\nSenate Report No. 95-114, at 3 (1977)\nWhat Is Covered by the Accounting\nProvisions?\nBooks and Records Provision\nBribes, both foreign and domestic, are often mischaracterized\nin companies’ books and records. Section 13(b)(2)(A) of\nthe Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(2)(A)), commonly\ncalled the “books and records” provision, requires issuers\nto “make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in\nreasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions\nand dispositions of the assets of the issuer.” 216 The “in\nreasonable detail” qualification was adopted by Congress\n“in light of the concern that such a standard, if unqualified,\nmight connote a degree of exactitude and precision which\nis unrealistic.” 217 The addition of this phrase was intended\nto make clear “that the issuer’s records should reflect transactions\nin conformity with accepted methods of recording\neconomic events and effectively prevent off-the-books slush\nfunds and payments of bribes.” 218\nThe term “reasonable detail” is defined in the statute\nas the level of detail that would “satisfy prudent officials in\nthe conduct of their own affairs.” 219 Thus, as Congress noted\nwhen it adopted this definition, “[t]he concept of reasonableness\nof necessity contemplates the weighing of a number of\nrelevant factors, including the costs of compliance.” 220\nAlthough the standard is one of reasonable detail,\nit is never appropriate to mischaracterize transactions in a\ncompany’s books and records. 221 Bribes are often concealed\nunder the guise of legitimate payments, such as commissions\nor consulting fees.\nIn instances where all the elements of a violation of\nthe anti-bribery provisions are not met—where, for example,\nthere was no use of interstate commerce—companies\nnonetheless may be liable if the improper payments are inaccurately\nrecorded. Consistent with the FCPA’s approach\nto prohibiting payments of any value that are made with a\ncorrupt purpose, there is no materiality threshold under the\nbooks and records provision. In combination with the internal\ncontrols provision, the requirement that issuers maintain\nbooks and records that accurately and fairly reflect the\ncorporation’s transactions “assure[s], among other things,\nthat the assets of the issuer are used for proper corporate\npurpose[s].” 222 As with the anti-bribery provisions, DOJ’s\nand SEC’s enforcement of the books and records provision\nhas typically involved misreporting of either large bribe payments\nor widespread inaccurate recording of smaller payments\nmade as part of a systemic pattern of bribery.\nBribes Have Been Mischaracterized As:\n• Commissions or Royalties\n• Consulting Fees\n• Sales and Marketing Expenses\n• Scientific Incentives or Studies\n• Travel and Entertainment Expenses\n• Rebates or Discounts\n• After Sales Service Fees\n• Miscellaneous Expenses\n• Petty Cash Withdrawals\n• Free Goods\n• Intercompany Accounts\n• Supplier / Vendor Payments\n• Write-offs\n• “Customs Intervention” Payments\n39\nInternal Controls Provision\nThe payment of bribes often occurs in companies that\nhave weak internal control environments. Internal controls\nover financial reporting are the processes used by companies\nto provide reasonable assurances regarding the reliability\nof financial reporting and the preparation of financial\nstatements. They include various components, such as: a\ncontrol environment that covers the tone set by the organization\nregarding integrity and ethics; risk assessments; control\nactivities that cover policies and procedures designed\nto ensure that management directives are carried out (e.g.,\napprovals, authorizations, reconciliations, and segregation\nof duties); information and communication; and monitoring.\nSection 13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.\n§ 78m(b)(2)(B)), commonly called the “internal controls”\nprovision, requires issuers to:\ndevise and maintain a system of internal accounting\ncontrols sufficient to provide reasonable assurances\nthat—\n(i) transactions are executed in accordance with management’s\ngeneral or specific authorization;\n(ii) transactions are recorded as necessary (I) to permit\npreparation of financial statements in conformity\nwith generally accepted accounting principles or any\nother criteria applicable to such statements, and (II)\nto maintain accountability for assets;\n(iii) access to assets is permitted only in accordance\nwith management’s general or specific authorization;\nand\n(iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared\nwith the existing assets at reasonable intervals\nand appropriate action is taken with respect to any\ndifferences …. 223\nchapter 3\nThe FCPA:\nAccounting Provisions\nAn effective compliance program is a critical component\nof an issuer’s internal controls. Fundamentally,\nthe design of a company’s internal controls must take into\naccount the operational realities and risks attendant to the\ncompany’s business, such as: the nature of its products or\nservices; how the products or services get to market; the\nnature of its work force; the degree of regulation; the extent\nof its government interaction; and the degree to which it\nhas operations in countries with a high risk of corruption. A\ncompany’s compliance program should be tailored to these\ndifferences. Businesses whose operations expose them to a\nhigh risk of corruption will necessarily devise and employ\ndifferent internal controls than businesses that have a lesser\nexposure to corruption, just as a financial services company\nwould be expected to devise and employ different internal\ncontrols than a manufacturer.\nA 2008 case against a German manufacturer of industrial\nand consumer products illustrates a systemic internal\ncontrols problem involving bribery that was unprecedented\nin scale and geographic reach. From 2001 to 2007, the company\ncreated elaborate payment schemes—including slush\nLike the “reasonable detail” requirement in the\nbooks and records provision, the Act defines “reasonable\nassurances” as “such level of detail and degree of assurance\nas would satisfy prudent officials in the conduct of their\nown affairs.” 224\nThe Act does not specify a particular set of controls\nthat companies are required to implement. Rather, the\ninternal controls provision gives companies the flexibility\nto develop and maintain a system of controls that is appropriate\nto their particular needs and circumstances.\nCompanies with ineffective internal\ncontrols often face risks of embezzlement\nand self-dealing by employees, commercial\nbribery, export control problems, and\nviolations of other U.S. and local laws.\n40\nfunds, off-the-books accounts, and systematic payments to\nbusiness consultants and other intermediaries—to facilitate\nbribery. Payments were made in ways that obscured their\npurpose and the ultimate recipients of the money. In some\ncases, employees obtained large amounts of cash from cash\ndesks and then transported the cash in suitcases across international\nborders. Authorizations for some payments were\nplaced on sticky notes and later removed to avoid any permanent\nrecord. The company made payments totaling approximately\n$1.36 billion through various mechanisms, including\n$805.5 million as bribes and $554.5 million for unknown\npurposes. 225 The company was charged with internal controls\nand books and records violations, along with anti-bribery\nviolations, and paid over $1.6 billion to resolve the case with\nauthorities in the United States and Germany. 226\nThe types of internal control failures identified in the\nabove example exist in many other cases where companies\nwere charged with internal controls violations. 227 A 2010\ncase against a multi-national automobile manufacturer\ninvolved bribery that occurred over a long period of time in\nmultiple countries. 228 In that case, the company used dozens\nof ledger accounts, known internally as “internal third\nparty accounts,” to maintain credit balances for the benefit\nof government officials. 229 The accounts were funded\nthrough several bogus pricing mechanisms, such as “price\nsurcharges,” “price inclusions,” or excessive commissions. 230\nThe company also used artificial discounts or rebates on\nsales contracts to generate the money to pay the bribes. 231\nThe bribes also were made through phony sales intermediaries\nand corrupt business partners, as well as through the\nuse of cash desks. 232 Sales executives would obtain cash from\nthe company in amounts as high as hundreds of thousands\nof dollars, enabling the company to obscure the purpose\nand recipients of the money paid to government officials. 233\nIn addition to bribery charges, the company was charged\nwith internal controls and books and records violations.\nGood internal controls can prevent not only FCPA\nviolations, but also other illegal or unethical conduct by the\ncompany, its subsidiaries, and its employees. DOJ and SEC\nhave repeatedly brought FCPA cases that also involved\nother types of misconduct, such as financial fraud, 234\ncommercial bribery, 235 export controls violations, 236 and\nembezzlement or self-dealing by company employees. 237\nPotential Reporting and Anti-Fraud Violations\nIssuers have reporting obligations under Section\n13(a) of the Exchange Act, which requires issuers to file\nan annual report that contains comprehensive information\nabout the issuer. Failure to properly disclose material information\nabout the issuer’s business, including material revenue,\nexpenses, profits, assets, or liabilities related to bribery\nof foreign government officials, may give rise to anti-fraud\nand reporting violations under Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of\nthe Exchange Act.\nFor example, a California-based technology company\nwas charged with reporting violations, in addition to violations\nof the FCPA’s anti-bribery and accounting provisions,\nwhen its bribery scheme led to material misstatements in its\nSEC filings. 238 The company was awarded contracts procured\nthrough bribery of Chinese officials that generated material\nrevenue and profits. The revenue and profits helped the company\noffset losses incurred to develop new products expected\nto become the company’s future source of revenue growth.\nThe company improperly recorded the bribe payments as\nsales commission expenses in its books and records.\nCompanies engaged in bribery may also be engaged\nin activity that violates the anti-fraud and reporting provisions.\nFor example, an oil and gas pipeline company and\nits employees engaged in a long-running scheme to use the\ncompany’s petty cash accounts in Nigeria to make a variety\nof corrupt payments to Nigerian tax and court officials\nusing false invoices. 239 The company and its employees also\nengaged in a fraudulent scheme to minimize the company’s\ntax obligations in Bolivia by using false invoices to claim\nfalse offsets to its value-added tax obligations. The scheme\nresulted in material overstatements of the company’s net\nincome in the company’s financial statements, which violated\nthe Exchange Act’s anti-fraud and reporting provisions.\nBoth schemes also violated the books and records\nand internal controls provisions.\n41\nWhat Are Management’s Other Obligations?\nSarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002\nIn 2002, in response to a series of accounting scandals\ninvolving U.S. companies, Congress enacted the Sarbanes-\nOxley Act (Sarbanes-Oxley or SOX), 240 which strengthened\nthe accounting requirements for issuers. All issuers\nmust comply with Sarbanes-Oxley’s requirements, several\nof which have FCPA implications.\nSOX Section 302 (15 U.S.C. § 7241)—Responsibility\nof Corporate Officers for the Accuracy and Validity of\nCorporate Financial Reports\nSection 302 of Sarbanes-Oxley requires that a company’s\n“principal officers” (typically the Chief Executive\nOfficer (CEO) and Chief Financial Officer (CFO)) take\nresponsibility for and certify the integrity of their company’s\nfinancial reports on a quarterly basis. Under Exchange\nAct Rule 13a-14, which is commonly called the “SOX certification”\nrule, each periodic report filed by an issuer must\ninclude a certification signed by the issuer’s principal executive\nofficer and principal financial officer that, among other\nthings, states that: (i) based on the officer’s knowledge, the\nreport contains no material misstatements or omissions;\n(ii) based on the officer’s knowledge, the relevant financial\nstatements are accurate in all material respects; (iii) internal\ncontrols are properly designed; and (iv) the certifying\nofficers have disclosed to the issuer’s audit committee and\nauditors all significant internal control deficiencies.\nSOX Section 404 (15 U.S.C. § 7262)—Reporting\non the State of a Company’s Internal Controls over\nFinancial Reporting\nSarbanes-Oxley also strengthened a company’s\nrequired disclosures concerning the state of its internal control\nover financial reporting. Under Section 404, issuers are\nrequired to present in their annual reports management’s\nconclusion regarding the effectiveness of the company’s\ninternal controls over financial reporting. This statement\nmust also assess the effectiveness of such internal controls\nand procedures. In addition, the company’s independent\nchapter 3\nThe FCPA:\nAccounting Provisions\nauditor must attest to and report on its assessment of the\neffectiveness of the company’s internal controls over financial\nreporting.\nAs directed by Section 404, SEC has adopted\nrules requiring issuers and their independent auditors to\nreport to the public on the effectiveness of the company’s\ninternal controls over financial reporting. 241 These\ninternal controls include those related to illegal acts and\nfraud—including acts of bribery—that could result in a\nmaterial misstatement of the company’s financial statements.\n242 In 2007, SEC issued guidance on controls over\nfinancial reporting. 243\nSOX Section 802 (18 U.S.C. §§ 1519 and 1520)—\nCriminal Penalties for Altering Documents\nSection 802 of Sarbanes-Oxley prohibits altering,\ndestroying, mutilating, concealing, or falsifying records,\ndocuments, or tangible objects with the intent to obstruct,\nimpede, or influence a potential or actual federal investigation.\nThis section also prohibits any accountant from knowingly\nand willfully violating the requirement that all audit\nor review papers be maintained for a period of five years.\nWho Is Covered by the Accounting\nProvisions?\nCivil Liability for Issuers, Subsidiaries, and Affiliates\nThe FCPA’s accounting provisions apply to every\nissuer that has a class of securities registered pursuant to\nSection 12 of the Exchange Act or that is required to file\nannual or other periodic reports pursuant to Section 15(d)\nof the Exchange Act. 244 These provisions apply to any issuer\nwhose securities trade on a national securities exchange in\nthe United States, including foreign issuers with exchangetraded\nAmerican Depository Receipts. 245 They also apply\n42\nto companies whose stock trades in the over-the-counter\nmarket in the United States and which file periodic reports\nwith the Commission, such as annual and quarterly reports.\nUnlike the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, the accounting\nprovisions do not apply to private companies. 246\nAlthough the FCPA’s accounting requirements are\ndirected at “issuers,” an issuer’s books and records include\nthose of its consolidated subsidiaries and affiliates. An issuer’s\nresponsibility thus extends to ensuring that subsidiaries\nor affiliates under its control, including foreign subsidiaries\nand joint venture partners, comply with the accounting\nprovisions. For instance, DOJ and SEC brought enforcement\nactions against a California company for violating the\nFCPA’s accounting provisions when two Chinese joint ventures\nin which it was a partner paid more than $400,000 in\nbribes over a four-year period to obtain business in China. 247\nSales personnel in China made the illicit payments by obtaining\ncash advances from accounting personnel, who recorded\nthe payments on the books as “business fees” or “travel and\nentertainment” expenses. Although the payments were made\nexclusively in China by Chinese employees of the joint venture,\nthe California company failed to have adequate internal\ncontrols and failed to act on red flags indicating that its affiliates\nwere engaged in bribery. The California company paid\n$1.15 million in civil disgorgement and a criminal monetary\npenalty of $1.7 million.\nCompanies may not be able to exercise the same level\nof control over a minority-owned subsidiary or affiliate as\nthey do over a majority or wholly owned entity. Therefore,\nif a parent company owns less than 50% of a subsidiary or\naffiliate, the parent is only required to use its best efforts\nto cause the minority-owned subsidiary or affiliate to\ndevise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls\nconsistent with the issuer’s own obligations under\nthe FCPA. 248 In evaluating an issuer’s good faith efforts,\nall the circumstances—including “the relative degree of\nthe issuer’s ownership of the domestic or foreign firm and\nthe laws and practices governing the business operations\nof the country in which such firm is located”—are taken\ninto account. 249\nCivil Liability for Individuals and Other Entities\nCompanies (including subsidiaries of issuers) and\nindividuals may also face civil liability for aiding and abetting\nor causing an issuer’s violation of the accounting provisions.\n250 For example, in April 2010, SEC charged four\nindividuals—a Country Manager, a Senior Vice President\nof Sales, a Regional Financial Director, and an International\nController of a U.S. issuer—for their roles in schemes to\nbribe Kyrgyz and Thai government officials to purchase\ntobacco from their employer. The complaint alleged that,\namong other things, the individuals aided and abetted the\nissuer company’s violations of the books and records and\ninternal controls provisions by “knowingly provid[ing]\nsubstantial assistance to” the parent company. 251 All four\nexecutives settled the charges against them, consenting to\nthe entry of final judgments permanently enjoining them\nfrom violating the accounting and anti-bribery provisions,\nwith two executives paying civil penalties. 252 As in other\nareas of federal securities law, corporate officers also can be\nheld liable as control persons. 253\nSimilarly, in October 2011, SEC brought an administrative\naction against a U.S. water valve manufacturer and\na former employee of the company’s Chinese subsidiary\nfor violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions. 254 The\nChinese subsidiary had made improper payments to employees\nof certain design institutes to create design specifications\nthat favored the company’s valve products. The payments\nwere disguised as sales commissions in the subsidiary’s books\nand records, thereby causing the U.S. issuer’s books and\nrecords to be inaccurate. The general manager of the subsidiary,\nwho approved the payments and knew or should have\nknown that they were improperly recorded, was ordered to\ncease-and-desist from committing or causing violations of\nthe accounting provisions, among other charges. 255\nAdditionally, individuals and entities can be held\ndirectly civilly liable for falsifying an issuer’s books and\nrecords or for circumventing internal controls. Exchange\nAct Rule 13b2-1 provides: “No person shall, directly or\nindirectly, falsify or cause to be falsified, any book, record\nor account subject to [the books and records provision] of\nthe Securities Exchange Act.” 256 And Section 13(b)(5) of\n43\nthe Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. § 78m(b)(5)) provides that\n“[n]o person shall knowingly circumvent or knowingly fail\nto implement a system of internal accounting controls or\nknowingly falsify any book, record, or account ….” 257 The\nExchange Act defines “person” to include a “natural person,\ncompany, government, or political subdivision, agency, or\ninstrumentality of a government.” 258\nAn issuer’s officers and directors may also be held civilly\nliable for making false statements to a company’s auditor.\nExchange Act Rule 13b2-2 prohibits officers and directors\nfrom making (or causing to be made) materially false\nor misleading statements, including an omission of material\nfacts, to an accountant. This liability arises in connection\nwith any audit, review, or examination of a company’s financial\nstatements or in connection with the filing of any document\nwith SEC. 259\nFinally, the principal executive and principal financial\nofficer, or persons performing similar functions, can\nbe held liable for violating Exchange Act Rule 13a-14 by\nsigning false personal certifications required by SOX.\nThus, for example, in January 2011, SEC charged the former\nCEO of a U.S. issuer for his role in schemes to bribe\nIraqi government officials in connection with the United\nNations Oil-For-Food Programme and to bribe Iraqi and\nIndonesian officials to purchase the company’s fuel additives.\nThere, the company used false invoices and sham consulting\ncontracts to support large bribes that were passed\non to foreign officials through an agent, and the bribes were\nmischaracterized as legitimate commissions and travel fees\nin the company’s books and records. The officer directed\nand authorized the bribe payments and their false recording\nin the books and records. He also signed annual and quarterly\nSOX certifications in which he falsely represented that\nthe company’s financial statements were fairly presented\nand the company’s internal controls sufficiently designed,\nas well as annual representations to the company’s external\nauditors where he falsely stated that he complied with the\ncompany’s code of ethics and was unaware of any violations\nof the code of ethics by anyone else. The officer was charged\nwith aiding and abetting violations of the books and records\nand internal controls provisions, circumventing internal\nchapter 3\nThe FCPA:\nAccounting Provisions\ncontrols, falsifying books and records, making false statements\nto accountants, and signing false certifications. 260 He\nconsented to the entry of an injunction and paid disgorgement\nand a civil penalty. 261 He also later pleaded guilty in\nthe United Kingdom to conspiring to corrupt Iraqi and\nIndonesian officials. 262\nCriminal Liability for Accounting Violations\nCriminal liability can be imposed on companies\nand individuals for knowingly failing to comply with the\nFCPA’s books and records or internal controls provisions. 263\nAs with the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, individuals are\nonly subject to the FCPA’s criminal penalties for violations\nof the accounting provisions if they acted “willfully.” 264\nFor example, a French company was criminally\ncharged with failure to implement internal controls and\nfailure to keep accurate books and records, among other\nviolations. 265 As part of its deferred prosecution agreement,\nthe company admitted to numerous internal control failures,\nincluding failure to implement sufficient anti-bribery\ncompliance policies, maintain a sufficient system for the\nselection and approval of consultants, and conduct appropriate\naudits of payments to purported “business consultants.”\n266 Likewise, a German company pleaded guilty to\ninternal controls and books and records violations where,\nfrom 2001 through 2007, it made payments totaling\napproximately $1.36 billion through various mechanisms,\nincluding $805.5 million as bribes and $554.5 million for\nunknown purposes. 267\nIndividuals can be held criminally liable for accounting\nviolations. For example, a former managing director of a U.S.\nbank’s real estate business in China pleaded guilty to conspiring\nto evade internal accounting controls in order to transfer\na multi-million dollar ownership interest in a Shanghai\nbuilding to himself and a Chinese public official with whom\n44\nhe had a personal friendship. The former managing director\nrepeatedly made false representations to his employer about\nthe transaction and the ownership interests involved. 268\nConspiracy and Aiding and Abetting Liability\nAs with the FCPA’s anti-bribery provisions, companies\n(including subsidiaries of issuers) and individuals may\nface criminal liability for conspiring to commit or for aiding\nand abetting violations of the accounting provisions.\nFor example, the subsidiary of a Houston-based\ncompany pleaded guilty both to conspiring to commit and\nto aiding and abetting the company’s books and records\nand anti-bribery violations. 269 The subsidiary paid bribes\nof over $4 million and falsely characterized the payments\nas “commissions,” “fees,” or “legal services,” consequently\ncausing the company’s books and records to be inaccurate.\nAlthough the subsidiary was not an issuer and therefore\ncould not be charged directly with an accounting violation,\nit was criminally liable for its involvement in the parent\ncompany’s accounting violation.\nSimilarly, a U.S. subsidiary of a Swiss freight forwarding\ncompany that was not an issuer was charged with\nconspiring to commit and with aiding and abetting the\nbooks and records violations of its customers, who were\nissuers and therefore subject to the FCPA’s accounting\nprovisions. 270 The U.S. subsidiary substantially assisted the\nissuer-customers in violating the FCPA’s books and records\nprovision by masking the true nature of the bribe payments\nin the invoices it submitted to the issuer-customers. 271 The\nsubsidiary thus faced criminal liability for its involvement\nin the issuer-customers’ FCPA violations even though it\nwas not itself subject to the FCPA’s accounting provisions.\ncompany’s operations and financial condition. A company’s\nfinancial statements should be complete and fairly represent\nthe company’s financial condition. 272 Thus, under U.S.\nGAAP, any payments to foreign government officials must\nbe properly accounted for in a company’s books, records,\nand financial statements.\nU.S. laws, including SEC Rules, require issuers to\nundergo an annual external audit of their financial statements\nand to make those audited financial statements available to\nthe public by filing them with SEC. SEC Rules and the rules\nand standards issued by the Public Company Accounting\nOversight Board (PCAOB) under SEC oversight, require\nexternal auditors to be independent of the companies that\nthey audit. Independent auditors must comply with the rules\nand standards set forth by the PCAOB when they perform\nan audit of a public company. These audit standards govern,\nfor example, the auditor’s responsibility concerning material\nerrors, irregularities, or illegal acts by a client and its officers,\ndirectors, and employees. Additionally, the auditor has a\nresponsibility to obtain an understanding of an entity’s internal\ncontrols over financial reporting as part of its audit and\nmust communicate all significant deficiencies and material\nweaknesses identified during the audit to management and\nthe audit committee. 273\nUnder Section 10A of the Exchange Act, independent\nauditors who discover an illegal act, such as the payment\nof bribes to domestic or foreign government officials,\nhave certain obligations in connection with their audits of\npublic companies. 274 Generally, Section 10A requires auditors\nwho become aware of illegal acts to report such acts to\nappropriate levels within the company and, if the company\nfails to take appropriate action, to notify SEC.\nAuditor Obligations\nAll public companies in the United States must file\nannual financial statements that have been prepared in\nconformity with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting\nPrinciples (U.S. GAAP). These accounting principles are\namong the most comprehensive in the world. U.S. GAAP\nrequires an accounting of all assets, liabilities, revenue, and\nexpenses as well as extensive disclosures concerning the\n45\nchapter 3\nThe FCPA:\nAccounting Provisions\n46\n\nchapter 4\nOther Related\nU.S. Laws\nOTHER RELATED U.S. LAWS\nBusinesses and individuals should be aware that conduct that violates the\nFCPA’s anti-bribery or accounting provisions may also violate other statutes or\nregulations. Moreover, payments to foreign government officials and intermediaries\nmay violate these laws even if all of the elements of an FCPA violation\nare not present.\nTravel Act\nThe Travel Act, 18 U.S.C. § 1952, prohibits travel\nin interstate or foreign commerce or using the mail or any\nfacility in interstate or foreign commerce, with the intent\nto distribute the proceeds of any unlawful activity or to\npromote, manage, establish, or carry on any unlawful activity.\n275 “Unlawful activity” includes violations of not only\nthe FCPA, but also state commercial bribery laws. Thus,\nbribery between private commercial enterprises may, in\nsome circumstances, be covered by the Travel Act. Said differently,\nif a company pays kickbacks to an employee of a\nprivate company who is not a foreign official, such privateto-private\nbribery could possibly be charged under the\nTravel Act.\nDOJ has previously charged both individual and\ncorporate defendants in FCPA cases with violations of\nthe Travel Act. 276 For instance, an individual investor was\nconvicted of conspiracy to violate the FCPA and the Travel\nAct in 2009 where the relevant “unlawful activity” under\nthe Travel Act was an FCPA violation involving a bribery\nscheme in Azerbaijan. 277 Also in 2009, a California company\nthat engaged in both bribery of foreign officials in violation\nof the FCPA and commercial bribery in violation of\nCalifornia state law pleaded guilty to conspiracy to violate\nthe FCPA and the Travel Act, among other charges. 278\nMoney Laundering\nMany FCPA cases also involve violations of antimoney\nlaundering statutes. 279 For example, two Florida\nexecutives of a Miami-based telecommunications company\nwere convicted of FCPA and money laundering conduct\nwhere they conducted financial transactions involving the\nproceeds of specified unlawful activities—violations of the\nFCPA, the criminal bribery laws of Haiti, and wire fraud—\nin order to conceal and disguise these proceeds. Notably,\nalthough foreign officials cannot be prosecuted for FCPA\n48\nviolations, 280 three former Haitian officials involved in the\nsame scheme were convicted of money laundering. 281\nMail and Wire Fraud\nThe mail and wire fraud statutes may also apply. In\n2006, for example, a wholly owned foreign subsidiary of\na U.S. issuer pleaded guilty to both FCPA and wire fraud\ncounts where the scheme included overbilling the subsidiary’s\ncustomers—both government and private—and\nusing part of the overcharged money to pay kickbacks to the\ncustomers’ employees. The wire fraud charges alleged that\nthe subsidiary had funds wired from its parent’s Oregon\nbank account to off-the-books bank accounts in South\nKorea that were controlled by the subsidiary. The funds,\namounting to almost $2 million, were then paid to managers\nof state-owned and private steel production companies\nin China and South Korea as illegal commission payments\nand kickbacks that were disguised as refunds, commissions,\nand other seemingly legitimate expenses. 282\nsale of defense articles and services valued at $500,000 or\nmore triggers disclosure requirements concerning fees and\ncommissions, including bribes, in an aggregate amount of\n$100,000 or more. 285 Violations of AECA and ITAR can\nresult in civil and criminal penalties. 286\nTax Violations\nIndividuals and companies who violate the FCPA may\nalso violate U.S. tax law, which explicitly prohibits tax deductions\nfor bribes, such as false sales “commissions” deductions\nintended to conceal corrupt payments. 287 Internal Revenue\nService-Criminal Investigation has been involved in a number\nof FCPA investigations involving tax violations, as well as\nother financial crimes like money laundering.\nCertification and Reporting Violations\nCertain other licensing, certification, and reporting\nrequirements imposed by the U.S. government can also be\nimplicated in the foreign bribery context. For example, as\na condition of its facilitation of direct loans and loan guarantees\nto a foreign purchaser of U.S. goods and services,\nthe Export-Import Bank of the United States requires the\nU.S. supplier to make certifications concerning commissions,\nfees, or other payments paid in connection with the\nfinancial assistance and that it has not and will not violate\nthe FCPA. 283 A false certification may give rise to criminal\nliability for false statements. 284\nSimilarly, manufacturers, exporters, and brokers of\ncertain defense articles and services are subject to registration,\nlicensing, and reporting requirements under the\nArms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C. § 2751, et\nseq., and its implementing regulations, the International\nTraffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22 C.F.R. § 120, et\nseq. For example, under AECA and ITAR, all manufacturers\nand exporters of defense articles and services must register\nwith the Directorate of Defense Trade Controls. The\n49\nchapter 4\nOther Related\nU.S. Laws\n50\n\nchapter 5\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\nGUIDING PRINCIPLES OF\nENFORCEMENT\nWhat Does DOJ Consider When\nDeciding Whether to Open an\nInvestigation or Bring Charges?\nWhether and how DOJ will commence, decline,\nor otherwise resolve an FCPA matter is guided by the\nPrinciples of Federal Prosecution in the case of individuals,\nand the Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business\nOrganizations in the case of companies.\nDOJ Principles of Federal Prosecution\nThe Principles of Federal Prosecution, set forth in\nChapter 9-27.000 of the U.S. Attorney’s Manual, 288 provide\nguidance for DOJ prosecutors regarding initiating\nor declining prosecution, selecting charges, and plea-bargaining.\nThe Principles of Federal Prosecution provide that\nprosecutors should recommend or commence federal prosecution\nif the putative defendant’s conduct constitutes a\nfederal offense and the admissible evidence will probably be\nsufficient to obtain and sustain a conviction unless (1) no\nsubstantial federal interest would be served by prosecution;\n(2) the person is subject to effective prosecution in another\njurisdiction; or (3) an adequate non-criminal alternative to\nprosecution exists. In assessing the existence of a substantial\nfederal interest, the prosecutor is advised to “weigh all relevant\nconsiderations,” including the nature and seriousness\nof the offense; the deterrent effect of prosecution; the person’s\nculpability in connection with the offense; the person’s\nhistory with respect to criminal activity; the person’s\nwillingness to cooperate in the investigation or prosecution\nof others; and the probable sentence or other consequences\nif the person is convicted. The Principles of Federal\nProsecution also set out the considerations to be weighed\nwhen deciding whether to enter into a plea agreement with\nan individual defendant, including the nature and seriousness\nof the offense and the person’s willingness to cooperate,\nas well as the desirability of prompt and certain disposition\nof the case and the expense of trial and appeal. 289\nDOJ Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business\nOrganizations\nThe Principles of Federal Prosecution of Business\nOrganizations, set forth in Chapter 9-28.000 of the U.S.\nAttorney’s Manual, 290 provide guidance regarding the resolun\nof cases involving corporate wrongdoing. The Principles\ntio\nof Federal Prosecution of Business Organizations recognize\nthat resolution of corporate criminal cases by means other\n52\nthan indictment, including non-prosecution and deferred\nprosecution agreements, may be appropriate in certain circumstances.\nNine factors are considered in conducting an\ninvestigation, determining whether to charge a corporation,\nand negotiating plea or other agreements:\n• the nature and seriousness of the offense, including\nthe risk of harm to the public;\n• the pervasiveness of wrongdoing within the corporation,\nincluding the complicity in, or the condoning\nof, the wrongdoing by corporate management;\n• the corporation’s history of similar misconduct,\nincluding prior criminal, civil, and regulatory\nenforcement actions against it;\n• the corporation’s timely and voluntary disclosure of\nwrongdoing and its willingness to cooperate in the\ninvestigation of its agents;\n• the existence and effectiveness of the corporation’s\npre-existing compliance program;\n• the corporation’s remedial actions, including any\nefforts to implement an effective corporate compliance\nprogram or improve an existing one, replace\nresponsible management, discipline or terminate\nwrongdoers, pay restitution, and cooperate with the\nrelevant government agencies;\n• collateral consequences, including whether there\nis disproportionate harm to shareholders, pension\nholders, employees, and others not proven personally\nculpable, as well as impact on the public arising\nfrom the prosecution;\n• the adequacy of the prosecution of individuals\nresponsible for the corporation’s malfeasance; and\n• the adequacy of remedies such as civil or regulatory\nenforcement actions.\nAs these factors illustrate, in many investigations it\nwill be appropriate for a prosecutor to consider a corporation’s\npre-indictment conduct, including voluntary disclosure,\ncooperation, and remediation, in determining whether\nto seek an indictment. In assessing a corporation’s cooperation,\nprosecutors are prohibited from requesting attorneyclient\nprivileged materials with two exceptions—when a\ncorporation or its employee asserts an advice-of-counsel\ndefense and when the attorney-client communications were\nin furtherance of a crime or fraud. Otherwise, an organization’s\ncooperation may only be assessed on the basis of\nwhether it disclosed the relevant facts underlying an investigation—and\nnot on the basis of whether it has waived its\nattorney-client privilege or work product protection. 291\nWhat Does SEC Consider When\nDeciding Whether to Open an\nInvestigation or Bring Charges?\nSEC’s Enforcement Manual, published by SEC’s\nEnforcement Division and available on SEC’s website, 292\nsets forth information about how SEC conducts investigations,\nas well as the guiding principles that SEC staff\nconsiders when determining whether to open or close an\ninvestigation and whether civil charges are merited. There\nare various ways that potential FCPA violations come to\nthe attention of SEC staff, including: tips from informants\nor whistleblowers; information developed in other investigations;\nself-reports or public disclosures by companies;\nreferrals from other offices or agencies; public sources, such\nas media reports and trade publications; and proactive\ninvestigative techniques, including risk-based initiatives.\nInvestigations can be formal, such as where SEC has issued\na formal order of investigation that authorizes its staff to\nissue investigative subpoenas for testimony and documents,\nor informal, such as where the staff proceeds with the investigation\nwithout the use of investigative subpoenas.\nIn determining whether to open an investigation and,\nif so, whether an enforcement action is warranted, SEC\nstaff considers a number of factors, including: the statutes\nor rules potentially violated; the egregiousness of the potential\nviolation; the potential magnitude of the violation;\nwhether the potentially harmed group is particularly vulnerable\nor at risk; whether the conduct is ongoing; whether\nthe conduct can be investigated efficiently and within the\nstatute of limitations period; and whether other authorities,\nincluding federal or state agencies or regulators, might be\nbetter suited to investigate the conduct. SEC staff also may\n53\nconsider whether the case involves a possibly widespread\nindustry practice that should be addressed, whether the\ncase involves a recidivist, and whether the matter gives SEC\nan opportunity to be visible in a community that might not\notherwise be familiar with SEC or the protections afforded\nby the securities laws.\nFor more information about the Enforcement\nDivision’s procedures concerning investigations, enforcement\nactions, and cooperation with other regulators, see\nthe Enforcement Manual at http://www.sec.gov/divisions/\nenforce.shtml.\nSelf-Reporting, Cooperation, and\nRemedial Efforts\nWhile the conduct underlying any FCPA investigation\nis obviously a fundamental and threshold consideration\nin deciding what, if any, action to take, both DOJ\nand SEC place a high premium on self-reporting, along\nwith cooperation and remedial efforts, in determining the\nappropriate resolution of FCPA matters.\nCriminal Cases\nUnder DOJ’s Principles of Federal Prosecution of\nBusiness Organizations, federal prosecutors consider a\ncompany’s cooperation in determining how to resolve a\ncorporate criminal case. Specifically, prosecutors consider\nwhether the company made a voluntary and timely disprovide\nrel-\nclosure as well as the company’s willingness to\nevant information and evidence and identify relevant actors\ninside and outside the company, including senior executives.\nIn addition, prosecutors may consider a company’s\nremedial actions, including efforts to improve an existing\ncompliance program or appropriate disciplining of wrongdoers.\n293 A company’s remedial measures should be meaningful\nand illustrate its recognition of the seriousness of the\nmisconduct, for example, by taking steps to implement the\npersonnel, operational, and organizational changes necessary\nto establish an awareness among employees that criminal\nconduct will not be tolerated. 294\nThe Principles of Federal Prosecution similarly provide\nthat prosecutors may consider an individual’s willingness\nchapter 5\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\nto cooperate in deciding whether a prosecution should\nbe undertaken and how it should be resolved. Although a\nwillingness to cooperate will not, by itself, generally relieve\na person of criminal liability, it may be given “serious consideration”\nin evaluating whether to enter into a plea agreement\nwith a defendant, depending on the nature and value\nof the cooperation offered. 295\nThe U.S. Sentencing Guidelines similarly take into\naccount an individual defendant’s cooperation and voluntary\ndisclosure. Under § 5K1.1, a defendant’s cooperation,\nif sufficiently substantial, may justify the government filing\na motion for a reduced sentence. And under § 5K2.16, a\ndefendant’s voluntary disclosure of an offense prior to its\ndiscovery—if the offense was unlikely to have been discovered\notherwise—may warrant a downward departure in\ncertain circumstances.\nChapter 8 of the Sentencing Guidelines, which governs\nthe sentencing of organizations, takes into account an\norganization’s remediation as part of an “effective compliance\nand ethics program.” One of the seven elements of\nsuch a program provides that after the detection of criminal\nconduct, “the organization shall take reasonable steps\nto respond appropriately to the criminal conduct and to\nprevent further similar criminal conduct, including making\nany necessary modifications to the organization’s\ncompliance and ethics program.” 296 Having an effective\ncompliance and ethics program may lead to a three-point\nreduction in an organization’s culpability score under\n§ 8C2.5, which affects the fine calculation under the\nGuidelines. Similarly, an organization’s self-reporting,\ncooperation, and acceptance of responsibility may lead to\nfine reductions under § 8C2.5(g) by decreasing the culpability\nscore. Conversely, an organization will not qualify\nfor the compliance program reduction when it unreasonably\ndelayed reporting the offense. 297 Similar to § 5K1.1\n54\nfor individuals, organizations can qualify for departures\npursuant to § 8C4.1 of the Guidelines for cooperating in\nthe prosecution of others.\nCivil Cases\nSEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by\nCompanies\nSEC’s framework for evaluating cooperation by companies\nis set forth in its 2001 Report of Investigation Pursuant\nto Section 21(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and\nCommission Statement on the Relationship of Cooperation to\nAgency Enforcement Decisions, which is commonly known\nas the Seaboard Report. 298 The report, which explained the\nCommission’s decision not to take enforcement action\nagainst a public company for certain accounting violations\ncaused by its subsidiary, details the many factors SEC considers\nin determining whether, and to what extent, it grants leniency\nto companies for cooperating in its investigations and\nfor related good corporate citizenship. Specifically, the report\nidentifies four broad measures of a company’s cooperation:\n• self-policing prior to the discovery of the misconduct,\nincluding establishing effective compliance\nprocedures and an appropriate tone at the top;\n• self-reporting of misconduct when it is discovered,\nincluding conducting a thorough review of the\nnature, extent, origins, and consequences of the misconduct,\nand promptly, completely, and effectively\ndisclosing the misconduct to the public, to regulatory\nagencies, and to self-regulatory organizations;\n• remediation, including dismissing or appropriately\ndisciplining wrongdoers, modifying and improving\ninternal controls and procedures to prevent\nrecurrence of the misconduct, and appropriately\ncompensating those adversely affected; and\n• cooperation with law enforcement authorities,\nincluding providing SEC staff with all information\nrelevant to the underlying violations and the\ncompany’s remedial efforts.\nSince every enforcement matter is different, this analytical\nframework sets forth general principles but does not\nlimit SEC’s broad discretion to evaluate every case individually\non its own unique facts and circumstances. Similar\nto SEC’s treatment of cooperating individuals, credit\nfor cooperation by companies may range from taking no\nenforcement action to pursuing reduced sanctions in connection\nwith enforcement actions.\nSEC’s Framework for Evaluating Cooperation by\nIndividuals\nIn 2010, SEC announced a new cooperation program\nfor individuals. 299 SEC staff has a wide range of tools to\nfacilitate and reward cooperation by individuals, from taking\nno enforcement action to pursuing reduced sanctions in\nconnection with enforcement actions. Although the evaluation\nof cooperation depends on the specific circumstances,\nSEC generally evaluates four factors to determine whether,\nto what extent, and in what manner to credit cooperation\nby individuals:\n• the assistance provided by the cooperating individual\nin SEC’s investigation or related enforcement\nactions, including, among other things: the\nvalue and timeliness of the cooperation, including\nwhether the individual was the first to report the\nmisconduct to SEC or to offer his or her cooperation;\nwhether the investigation was initiated based\nupon the information or other cooperation by the\nindividual; the quality of the cooperation, including\nwhether the individual was truthful and the\ncooperation was complete; the time and resources\nconserved as a result of the individual’s cooperation;\nand the nature of the cooperation, such as the\ntype of assistance provided;\n• the importance of the matter in which the individual\nprovided cooperation;\n• the societal interest in ensuring that the cooperating\nindividual is held accountable for his or her\nmisconduct, including the severity of the individual’s\nmisconduct, the culpability of the individual,\nand the efforts undertaken by the individual to\nremediate the harm; and\n55\n• the appropriateness of a cooperation credit in light\nof the profile of the cooperating individual.\nCorporate Compliance Program\nIn a global marketplace, an effective compliance program\nis a critical component of a company’s internal controls\nand is essential to detecting and preventing FCPA violations.\n300 Effective compliance programs are tailored to the\ncompany’s specific business and to the risks associated with\nthat business. They are dynamic and evolve as the business\nand the markets change.\nAn effective compliance program promotes “an organizational\nculture that encourages ethical conduct and a\ncommitment to compliance with the law.” 301 Such a program\nprotects a company’s reputation, ensures investor value and\nconfidence, reduces uncertainty in business transactions, and\nsecures a company’s assets. 302 A well-constructed, thoughtfully\nimplemented, and consistently enforced compliance\nand ethics program helps prevent, detect, remediate, and\nreport misconduct, including FCPA violations.\nIn addition to considering whether a company has\nself-reported, cooperated, and taken appropriate remedial\nactions, DOJ and SEC also consider the adequacy of a\ncompany’s compliance program when deciding what, if any,\naction to take. The program may influence whether or not\ncharges should be resolved through a deferred prosecution\nagreement (DPA) or non-prosecution agreement (NPA),\nas well as the appropriate length of any DPA or NPA, or\nthe term of corporate probation. It will often affect the\npenalty amount and the need for a monitor or self-reporting.\n303 As discussed above, SEC’s Seaboard Report focuses,\namong other things, on a company’s self-policing prior to\nthe discovery of the misconduct, including whether it had\nestablished effective compliance procedures. 304 Likewise,\nthree of the nine factors set forth in DOJ’s Principles of\nFederal Prosecution of Business Organizations relate, either\ndirectly or indirectly, to a compliance program’s design and\nimplementation, including the pervasiveness of wrongdoing\nwithin the company, the existence and effectiveness of\nthe company’s pre-existing compliance program, and the\ncompany’s remedial actions. 305 DOJ also considers the U.S.\nchapter 5\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\nSentencing Guidelines’ elements of an effective compliance\nprogram, as set forth in § 8B2.1 of the Guidelines.\nThese considerations reflect the recognition that\na company’s failure to prevent every single violation does\nnot necessarily mean that a particular company’s compliance\nprogram was not generally effective. DOJ and SEC\nunderstand that “no compliance program can ever prevent\nall criminal activity by a corporation’s employees,” 306 and\nthey do not hold companies to a standard of perfection. An\nassessment of a company’s compliance program, including\nits design and good faith implementation and enforcement,\nis an important part of the government’s assessment of\nwhether a violation occurred, and if so, what action should\nbe taken. In appropriate circumstances, DOJ and SEC may\ndecline to pursue charges against a company based on the\ncompany’s effective compliance program, or may otherwise\nseek to reward a company for its program, even when that\nprogram did not prevent the particular underlying FCPA\nviolation that gave rise to the investigation. 307\nDOJ and SEC have no formulaic requirements\nregarding compliance programs. Rather, they employ a\ncommon-sense and pragmatic approach to evaluating compliance\nprograms, making inquiries related to three basic\nquestions:\n• Is the company’s compliance program well\ndesigned?\n• Is it being applied in good faith?\n• Does it work? 308\nThis guide contains information regarding some of\nthe basic elements DOJ and SEC consider when evaluating\ncompliance programs. Although the focus is on compliance\nwith the FCPA, given the existence of anti-corruption\nlaws in many other countries, businesses should consider\ndesigning programs focused on anti-corruption compliance\nmore broadly. 309\n56\nHallmarks of Effective Compliance\nPrograms\nIndividual companies may have different compliance\nneeds depending on their size and the particular risks associated\nwith their businesses, among other factors. When it\ncomes to compliance, there is no one-size-fits-all program.\nThus, the discussion below is meant to provide insight into\nthe aspects of compliance programs that DOJ and SEC\nassess, recognizing that companies may consider a variety\nof factors when making their own determination of what\nis appropriate for their specific business needs. 310 Indeed,\nsmall- and medium-size enterprises likely will have different\ncompliance programs from large multi-national corporations,\na fact DOJ and SEC take into account when evaluating\ncompanies’ compliance programs.\nCompliance programs that employ a “check-the-box”\napproach may be inefficient and, more importantly, ineffective.\nBecause each compliance program should be tailored\nto an organization’s specific needs, risks, and challenges,\nthe information provided below should not be considered\na substitute for a company’s own assessment of the corporate\ncompliance program most appropriate for that particular\nbusiness organization. In the end, if designed carefully,\nimplemented earnestly, and enforced fairly, a company’s\ncompliance program—no matter how large or small the\norganization—will allow the company generally to prevent\nviolations, detect those that do occur, and remediate them\npromptly and appropriately.\nCommitment from Senior Management and a\nClearly Articulated Policy Against Corruption\nWithin a business organization, compliance begins\nwith the board of directors and senior executives setting\nthe proper tone for the rest of the company. Managers and\nemployees take their cues from these corporate leaders.\nThus, DOJ and SEC consider the commitment of corporate\nleaders to a “culture of compliance” 311 and look to see\nif this high-level commitment is also reinforced and implemented\nby middle managers and employees at all levels of\na business. A well-designed compliance program that is\nnot enforced in good faith, such as when corporate management\nexplicitly or implicitly encourages employees to\nengage in misconduct to achieve business objectives, will be\nineffective. DOJ and SEC have often encountered companies\nwith compliance programs that are strong on paper but\nthat nevertheless have significant FCPA violations because\nmanagement has failed to effectively implement the program\neven in the face of obvious signs of corruption. This\nmay be the result of aggressive sales staff preventing compliance\npersonnel from doing their jobs effectively and of\nsenior management, more concerned with securing a valuable\nbusiness opportunity than enforcing a culture of compliance,\nsiding with the sales team. The higher the financial\nstakes of the transaction, the greater the temptation for\nmanagement to choose profit over compliance.\nA strong ethical culture directly supports a strong\ncompliance program. By adhering to ethical standards,\nsenior managers will inspire middle managers to reinforce\nthose standards. Compliant middle managers, in turn, will\nencourage employees to strive to attain those standards\nthroughout the organizational structure. 312\nIn short, compliance with the FCPA and ethical rules\nmust start at the top. DOJ and SEC thus evaluate whether\nsenior management has clearly articulated company standards,\ncommunicated them in unambiguous terms, adhered\nto them scrupulously, and disseminated them throughout\nthe organization.\nCode of Conduct and Compliance Policies and\nProcedures\nA company’s code of conduct is often the foundation\nupon which an effective compliance program is built. As\nDOJ has repeatedly noted in its charging documents, the\nmost effective codes are clear, concise, and accessible to all\nemployees and to those conducting business on the company’s\nbehalf. Indeed, it would be difficult to effectively\nimplement a compliance program if it was not available in\nthe local language so that employees in foreign subsidiaries\ncan access and understand it. When assessing a compliance\nprogram, DOJ and SEC will review whether the company\n57\nhas taken steps to make certain that the code of conduct\nremains current and effective and whether a company has\nperiodically reviewed and updated its code.\nWhether a company has policies and procedures that\noutline responsibilities for compliance within the company,\ndetail proper internal controls, auditing practices, and documentation\npolicies, and set forth disciplinary procedures\nwill also be considered by DOJ and SEC. These types of\npolicies and procedures will depend on the size and nature\nof the business and the risks associated with the business.\nEffective policies and procedures require an in-depth\nunderstanding of the company’s business model, including\nits products and services, third-party agents, customers,\ngovernment interactions, and industry and geographic\nrisks. Among the risks that a company may need to address\ninclude the nature and extent of transactions with foreign\ngovernments, including payments to foreign officials; use\nof third parties; gifts, travel, and entertainment expenses;\ncharitable and political donations; and facilitating and\nexpediting payments. For example, some companies with\nglobal operations have created web-based approval processes\nto review and approve routine gifts, travel, and entertainment\ninvolving foreign officials and private customers\nwith clear monetary limits and annual limitations. Many of\nthese systems have built-in flexibility so that senior management,\nor in-house legal counsel, can be apprised of and, in\nappropriate circumstances, approve unique requests. These\ntypes of systems can be a good way to conserve corporate\nresources while, if properly implemented, preventing and\ndetecting potential FCPA violations.\nRegardless of the specific policies and procedures\nimplemented, these standards should apply to personnel at\nall levels of the company.\nOversight, Autonomy, and Resources\nIn appraising a compliance program, DOJ and SEC\nalso consider whether a company has assigned responsibility\nfor the oversight and implementation of a company’s\ncompliance program to one or more specific senior\nexecutives within an organization. 313 Those individuals\nmust have appropriate authority within the organization,\nchapter 5\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\nadequate autonomy from management, and sufficient\nresources to ensure that the company’s compliance program\nis implemented effectively. 314 Adequate autonomy generally\nincludes direct access to an organization’s governing\nauthority, such as the board of directors and committees\nof the board of directors (e.g., the audit committee). 315\nDepending on the size and structure of an organization,\nit may be appropriate for day-to-day operational responsibility\nto be delegated to other specific individuals within\na company. 316 DOJ and SEC recognize that the reporting\nstructure will depend on the size and complexity of an\norganization. Moreover, the amount of resources devoted\nto compliance will depend on the company’s size, complexity,\nindustry, geographical reach, and risks associated with\nthe business. In assessing whether a company has reasonable\ninternal controls, DOJ and SEC typically consider whether\nthe company devoted adequate staffing and resources to the\ncompliance program given the size, structure, and risk profile\nof the business.\nRisk Assessment\nAssessment of risk is fundamental to developing a\nstrong compliance program, and is another factor DOJ\nand SEC evaluate when assessing a company’s compliance\nprogram. 317 One-size-fits-all compliance programs are\ngenerally ill-conceived and ineffective because resources\ninevitably are spread too thin, with too much focus on lowrisk\nmarkets and transactions to the detriment of high-risk\nareas. Devoting a disproportionate amount of time policing\nmodest entertainment and gift-giving instead of focusing\non large government bids, questionable payments to\nthird-party consultants, or excessive discounts to resellers\nand distributors may indicate that a company’s compliance\nprogram is ineffective. A $50 million contract with a\ngovernment agency in a high-risk country warrants greater\n58\nscrutiny than modest and routine gifts and entertainment.\nSimilarly, performing identical due diligence on all thirdparty\nagents, irrespective of risk factors, is often counterproductive,\ndiverting attention and resources away from\nthose third parties that pose the most significant risks.\nDOJ and SEC will give meaningful credit to a company\nthat implements in good faith a comprehensive, risk-based\ncompliance program, even if that program does not prevent\nan infraction in a low risk area because greater attention\nand resources had been devoted to a higher risk area.\nConversely, a company that fails to prevent an FCPA violation\non an economically significant, high-risk transaction\nbecause it failed to perform a level of due diligence commensurate\nwith the size and risk of the transaction is likely\nto receive reduced credit based on the quality and effectiveness\nof its compliance program.\nAs a company’s risk for FCPA violations increases,\nthat business should consider increasing its compliance\nprocedures, including due diligence and periodic internal\naudits. The degree of appropriate due diligence is fact-specific\nand should vary based on industry, country, size, and\nnature of the transaction, and the method and amount of\nthird-party compensation. Factors to consider, for instance,\ninclude risks presented by: the country and industry sector,\nthe business opportunity, potential business partners, level\nof involvement with governments, amount of government\nregulation and oversight, and exposure to customs and\nimmigration in conducting business affairs. When assessing\na company’s compliance program, DOJ and SEC take into\naccount whether and to what degree a company analyzes\nand addresses the particular risks it faces.\nTraining and Continuing Advice\nCompliance policies cannot work unless effectively\ncommunicated throughout a company. Accordingly, DOJ\nand SEC will evaluate whether a company has taken steps to\nensure that relevant policies and procedures have been communicated\nthroughout the organization, including through\nperiodic training and certification for all directors, officers,\nrelevant employees, and, where appropriate, agents and\nbusiness partners. 318 For example, many larger companies\nhave implemented a mix of web-based and in-person training\nconducted at varying intervals. Such training typically\ncovers company policies and procedures, instruction on\napplicable laws, practical advice to address real-life scenarios,\nand case studies. Regardless of how a company chooses\nto conduct its training, however, the information should\nbe presented in a manner appropriate for the targeted audience,\nincluding providing training and training materials\nin the local language. For example, companies may want to\nconsider providing different types of training to their sales\npersonnel and accounting personnel with hypotheticals\nor sample situations that are similar to the situations they\nmight encounter. In addition to the existence and scope of\na company’s training program, a company should develop\nappropriate measures, depending on the size and sophistication\nof the particular company, to provide guidance and\nadvice on complying with the company’s ethics and compliance\nprogram, including when such advice is needed\nurgently. Such measures will help ensure that the compliance\nprogram is understood and followed appropriately at\nall levels of the company.\nIncentives and Disciplinary Measures\nIn addition to evaluating the design and implementation\nof a compliance program throughout an organization,\nenforcement of that program is fundamental to its effectiveness.\n319 A compliance program should apply from the\nboard room to the supply room—no one should be beyond\nits reach. DOJ and SEC will thus consider whether, when\nenforcing a compliance program, a company has appropriate\nand clear disciplinary procedures, whether those procedures\nare applied reliably and promptly, and whether they\nare commensurate with the violation. Many companies\nhave found that publicizing disciplinary actions internally,\nwhere appropriate under local law, can have an important\ndeterrent effect, demonstrating that unethical and unlawful\nactions have swift and sure consequences.\nDOJ and SEC recognize that positive incentives can\nalso drive compliant behavior. These incentives can take many\n59\nforms such as personnel evaluations and promotions, rewards\nfor improving and developing a company’s compliance program,\nand rewards for ethics and compliance leadership. 320\nSome organizations, for example, have made adherence to\ncompliance a significant metric for management’s bonuses so\nthat compliance becomes an integral part of management’s\neveryday concern. Beyond financial incentives, some companies\nhave highlighted compliance within their organizations\nby recognizing compliance professionals and internal audit\nstaff. Others have made working in the company’s compliance\norganization a way to advance an employee’s career.\nSEC, for instance, has encouraged companies to embrace\nmethods to incentivize ethical and lawful behavior:\n[M]ake integrity, ethics and compliance part of the\npromotion, compensation and evaluation processes\nas well. For at the end of the day, the most effective\nway to communicate that “doing the right thing” is a\npriority, is to reward it. Conversely, if employees are\nled to believe that, when it comes to compensation\nand career advancement, all that counts is short-term\nprofitability, and that cutting ethical corners is an acceptable\nway of getting there, they’ll perform to that\nmeasure. To cite an example from a different walk\nof life: a college football coach can be told that the\ngraduation rates of his players are what matters, but\nhe’ll know differently if the sole focus of his contract\nextension talks or the decision to fire him is his winloss\nrecord. 321\nNo matter what the disciplinary scheme or potential\nincentives a company decides to adopt, DOJ and SEC will\nconsider whether they are fairly and consistently applied\nacross the organization. No executive should be above compliance,\nno employee below compliance, and no person\nwithin an organization deemed too valuable to be disciplined,\nif warranted. Rewarding good behavior and sanctioning\nbad behavior reinforces a culture of compliance and\nethics throughout an organization.\nThird-Party Due Diligence and Payments\nDOJ’s and SEC’s FCPA enforcement actions demonstrate\nthat third parties, including agents, consultants,\nand distributors, are commonly used to conceal the payment\nof bribes to foreign officials in international business\nchapter 5\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\ntransactions. Risk-based due diligence is particularly important\nwith third parties and will also be considered by DOJ\nand SEC in assessing the effectiveness of a company’s compliance\nprogram.\nAlthough the degree of appropriate due diligence\nmay vary based on industry, country, size and nature of the\ntransaction, and historical relationship with the third-party,\nsome guiding principles always apply.\nFirst, as part of risk-based due diligence, companies\nshould understand the qualifications and associations of\nits third-party partners, including its business reputation,\nand relationship, if any, with foreign officials. The degree of\nscrutiny should increase as red flags surface.\nSecond, companies should have an understanding of\nthe business rationale for including the third party in the\ntransaction. Among other things, the company should\nunderstand the role of and need for the third party and\nensure that the contract terms specifically describe the services\nto be performed. Additional considerations include\npayment terms and how those payment terms compare to\ntypical terms in that industry and country, as well as the\ntiming of the third party’s introduction to the business.\nMoreover, companies may want to confirm and document\nthat the third party is actually performing the work for\nwhich it is being paid and that its compensation is commensurate\nwith the work being provided.\nThird, companies should undertake some form of\nongoing monitoring of third-party relationships. 322 Where\nappropriate, this may include updating due diligence periodically,\nexercising audit rights, providing periodic training,\nand requesting annual compliance certifications by the\nthird party.\nIn addition to considering a company’s due diligence\non third parties, DOJ and SEC also assess whether\nthe company has informed third parties of the company’s\n60\nCompliance Program Case Study\nRecent DOJ and SEC actions relating to a financial institution’s real estate transactions with a government agency\nin China illustrate the benefits of implementing and enforcing a comprehensive risk-based compliance program. The\ncase involved a joint venture real estate investment in the Luwan District of Shanghai, China, between a U.S.-based\nfinancial institution and a state-owned entity that functioned as the District’s real estate arm. The government entity\nconducted the transactions through two special purpose vehicles (“SPVs”), with the second SPV purchasing a 12%\nstake in a real estate project.\nThe financial institution, through a robust compliance program, frequently trained its employees, imposed a\ncomprehensive payment-approval process designed to prevent bribery, and staffed a compliance department with\na direct reporting line to the board of directors. As appropriate given the industry, market, and size and structure of\nthe transactions, the financial institution (1) provided extensive FCPA training to the senior executive responsible for\nthe transactions and (2) conducted extensive due diligence on the transactions, the local government entity, and the\nSPVs. Due diligence on the entity included reviewing Chinese government records; speaking with sources familiar\nwith the Shanghai real estate market; checking the government entity’s payment records and credit references;\nconducting an on-site visit and placing a pretextual telephone call to the entity’s offices; searching media sources;\nand conducting background checks on the entity’s principals. The financial institution vetted the SPVs by obtaining\na letter with designated bank account information from a Chinese official associated with the government entity (the\n“Chinese Official”); using an international law firm to request and review 50 documents from the SPVs’ Canadian\nattorney; interviewing the attorney; and interviewing the SPVs’ management.\nNotwithstanding the financial institution’s robust compliance program and good faith enforcement of it, the\ncompany failed to learn that the Chinese Official personally owned nearly 50% of the second SPV (and therefore a\nnearly 6% stake in the joint venture) and that the SPV was used as a vehicle for corrupt payments. This failure was\ndue, in large part, to misrepresentations by the Chinese Official, the financial institution’s executive in charge of\nthe project, and the SPV’s attorney that the SPV was 100% owned and controlled by the government entity. DOJ\nand SEC declined to take enforcement action against the financial institution, and its executive pleaded guilty to\nconspiracy to violate the FCPA’s internal control provisions and also settled with SEC.\ncompliance program and commitment to ethical and lawful\nbusiness practices and, where appropriate, whether it\nhas sought assurances from third parties, through certifications\nand otherwise, of reciprocal commitments. These can\nbe meaningful ways to mitigate third-party risk.\nConfidential Reporting and Internal Investigation\nAn effective compliance program should include a\nmechanism for an organization’s employees and others to\nreport suspected or actual misconduct or violations of the\ncompany’s policies on a confidential basis and without fear of\nretaliation. 323 Companies may employ, for example, anonymous\nhotlines or ombudsmen. Moreover, once an allegation\nis made, companies should have in place an efficient, reliable,\nand properly funded process for investigating the allegation\nand documenting the company’s response, including any\ndisciplinary or remediation measures taken. Companies will\nwant to consider taking “lessons learned” from any reported\nviolations and the outcome of any resulting investigation to\nupdate their internal controls and compliance program and\nfocus future training on such issues, as appropriate.\nContinuous Improvement: Periodic Testing and\nReview\nFinally, a good compliance program should constantly\nevolve. A company’s business changes over time, as do the\nenvironments in which it operates, the nature of its customers,\nthe laws that govern its actions, and the standards of its\n61\nindustry. In addition, compliance programs that do not just\nexist on paper but are followed in practice will inevitably\nuncover compliance weaknesses and require enhancements.\nConsequently, DOJ and SEC evaluate whether companies\nregularly review and improve their compliance programs\nand not allow them to become stale.\nAccording to one survey, 64% of general counsel whose\ncompanies are subject to the FCPA say there is room for\nimprovement in their FCPA training and compliance programs.\n324 An organization should take the time to review and\ntest its controls, and it should think critically about its potential\nweaknesses and risk areas. For example, some companies\nhave undertaken employee surveys to measure their compliance\nculture and strength of internal controls, identify best\npractices, and detect new risk areas. Other companies periodically\ntest their internal controls with targeted audits to make\ncertain that controls on paper are working in practice. DOJ\nand SEC will give meaningful credit to thoughtful efforts\nto create a sustainable compliance program if a problem is\nlater discovered. Similarly, undertaking proactive evaluations\nbefore a problem strikes can lower the applicable penalty\nrange under the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines. 325 Although the\nnature and the frequency of proactive evaluations may vary\ndepending on the size and complexity of an organization, the\nidea behind such efforts is the same: continuous improvement\nand sustainability. 326\nMergers and Acquisitions: Pre-Acquisition Due\nDiligence and Post-Acquisition Integration\nIn the context of the FCPA, mergers and acquisitions\npresent both risks and opportunities. A company\nthat does not perform adequate FCPA due diligence prior\nto a merger or acquisition may face both legal and business\nrisks. 327 Perhaps most commonly, inadequate due diligence\ncan allow a course of bribery to continue—with all the\nattendant harms to a business’s profitability and reputation,\nas well as potential civil and criminal liability.\nIn contrast, companies that conduct effective FCPA\ndue diligence on their acquisition targets are able to evaluate\nmore accurately each target’s value and negotiate for the\ncosts of the bribery to be borne by the target. In addition,\nchapter 5\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\nsuch actions demonstrate to DOJ and SEC a company’s\ncommitment to compliance and are taken into account\nwhen evaluating any potential enforcement action. For\nexample, DOJ and SEC declined to take enforcement\naction against an acquiring issuer when the issuer, among\nother things, uncovered the corruption at the company\nbeing acquired as part of due diligence, ensured that the\ncorruption was voluntarily disclosed to the government,\ncooperated with the investigation, and incorporated the\nacquired company into its compliance program and internal\ncontrols. On the other hand, SEC took action against\nthe acquired company, and DOJ took action against a subsidiary\nof the acquired company. 328 When pre-acquisition\ndue diligence is not possible, DOJ has described procedures,\ncontained in Opinion Procedure Release No. 08-02,\npursuant to which companies can nevertheless be rewarded\nif they choose to conduct thorough post-acquisition FCPA\ndue diligence. 329\nFCPA due diligence, however, is normally only a\nportion of the compliance process for mergers and acquisitions.\nDOJ and SEC evaluate whether the acquiring company\npromptly incorporated the acquired company into all\nof its internal controls, including its compliance program.\nCompanies should consider training new employees, reevaluating\nthird parties under company standards, and, where\nappropriate, conducting audits on new business units.\nFor example, as a result of due diligence conducted\nby a California-based issuer before acquiring the majority\ninterest in a joint venture, the issuer learned of corrupt payments\nto obtain business. However, the issuer only implemented\nits internal controls “halfway” so as not to “choke\nthe sales engine and cause a distraction for the sales guys.”\nAs a result, the improper payments continued, and the\nissuer was held liable for violating the FCPA’s internal controls\nand books and records provisions. 330\n62\nOther Guidance on Compliance and\nInternational Best Practices\nIn addition to this guide, the U.S. Departments of\nCommerce and State have both issued publications that contain\nguidance regarding compliance programs. The Department\nof Commerce’s International Trade Administration has published\nBusiness Ethics: A Manual for Managing a Responsible\nBusiness Enterprise in Emerging Market Economies, 331 and the\nDepartment of State has published Fighting Global Corruption:\nBusiness Risk Management. 332\nThere is also an emerging international consensus on\ncompliance best practices, and a number of inter-governmental\nand non-governmental organizations have issued\nguidance regarding best practices for compliance. 333 Most\nnotably, the OECD’s 2009 Anti-Bribery Recommendation\nand its Annex II, Good Practice Guidance on Internal\nControls, Ethics, and Compliance, 334 published in February\n2010, were drafted based on consultations with the private\nsector and civil society and set forth specific good practices\nfor ensuring effective compliance programs and measures\nfor preventing and detecting foreign bribery. In addition,\nbusinesses may wish to refer to the following resources:\n• Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation—Anti-\nCorruption Code of Conduct for Business; 335\n• International Chamber of Commerce—ICC Rules\non Combating Corruption; 336\n• Transparency International—Business Principles for\nCountering Bribery; 337\n• United Nations Global Compact—The Ten\nPrinciples; 338\n• World Bank—Integrity Compliance\nGuidelines; 339 and\n• World Economic Forum—Partnering Against\nCorruption–Principles for Countering Bribery. 340\nHypothetical: Third-Party Vetting\nPart 1: Consultants\nCompany A, a U.S. issuer headquartered in Delaware, wants to start doing business in a country that poses high risks\nof corruption. Company A learns about a potential $50 million contract with the country’s Ministry of Immigration. This\nis a very attractive opportunity to Company A, both for its profitability and to open the door to future projects with the\ngovernment. At the suggestion of the company’s senior vice president of international sales (Sales Executive), Company A\nhires a local businessman who assures them that he has strong ties to political and government leaders in the country and\ncan help them win the contract. Company A enters into a consulting contract with the local businessman (Consultant). The\nagreement requires Consultant to use his best efforts to help the company win the business and provides for Consultant to\nreceive a significant monthly retainer as well as a success fee of 3% of the value of any contract the company wins.\nWhat steps should Company A consider taking before hiring Consultant?\nThere are several factors here that might lead Company A to perform heightened FCPA-related due diligence prior\nto retaining Consultant: (1) the market (high-risk country); (2) the size and significance of the deal to the company; (3) the\ncompany’s first time use of this particular consultant; (4) the consultant’s strong ties to political and government leaders;\n(5) the success fee structure of the contract; and (6) the vaguely-defined services to be provided. In order to minimize the\nlikelihood of incurring FCPA liability, Company A should carefully vet Consultant and his role in the transaction, including\nclose scrutiny of the relationship between Consultant and any Ministry of Immigration officials or other government officials.\nAlthough there is nothing inherently illegal about contracting with a third party that has close connections to politicians\nand government officials to perform legitimate services on a transaction, this type of relationship can be susceptible to\ncorruption. Among other things, Company A may consider conducting due diligence on Consultant, including background\n(cont’d)\n63\nchapter 5\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\nand reference checks; ensuring that the contract spells out exactly what services and deliverables (such as written status\nreports or other documentation) Consultant is providing; training Consultant on the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws;\nrequiring Consultant to represent that he will abide by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws; including audit rights in the\ncontract (and exercising those rights); and ensuring that payments requested by Consultant have the proper supporting\ndocumentation before they are approved for payment.\nPart 2: Distributors and Local Partners\nAssume the following alternative facts:\nInstead of hiring Consultant, Company A retains an often-used local distributor (Distributor) to sell Company A’s\nproducts to the Ministry of Immigration In negotiating the pricing structure, Distributor, which had introduced the project\nto Company A, claims that the standard discount price to Distributor creates insufficient margin for Distributor to cover\nwarehousing, distribution, installation, marketing, and training costs and requests an additional discount or rebate, or, in\nthe alternative, a contribution to its marketing efforts, either in the form of a lump sum or as a percentage of the total\ncontract. The requested discount/allowance is significantly larger than usual, although there is precedent at Company\nA for granting this level of discount in unique circumstances. Distributor further advises Company A that the Ministry’s\nprocurement officials responsible for awarding the contract have expressed a strong preference for including a particular\nlocal company (Local Partner) in the transaction as a subcontractor of Company A to perform installation, training, and\nother services that would normally have been performed by Distributor or Company A. According to Distributor, the\nMinistry has a solid working relationship with Local Partner, and it would cause less disruption for Local Partner to perform\nmost of the on-site work at the Ministry. One of the principals (Principal 1) of the Local Partner is an official in another\ngovernment ministry.\nWhat additional compliance considerations do these alternative facts raise?\nAs with Consultant in the first scenario above, Company A should carefully vet Distributor and Local Partner and their\nroles in the transaction in order to minimize the likelihood of incurring FCPA liability. While Company A has an established\nrelationship with Distributor, the fact that Distributor has requested an additional discount warrants further inquiry into\nthe economic justification for the change, particularly where, as here, the proposed transaction structure contemplates\npaying Local Partner to provide many of the same services that Distributor would otherwise provide. In many cases, it may\nbe appropriate for distributors to receive larger discounts to account for unique circumstances in particular transactions.\nThat said, a common mechanism to create additional margin for bribe payments is through excessive discounts or rebates\nto distributors. Accordingly, when a company has pre-existing relationships with distributors and other third parties,\ntransaction-specific due diligence—including an analysis of payment terms to confirm that the payment is commensurate\nwith the work being performed—can be critical even in circumstances where due diligence of the distributor or other third\nparty raises no initial red flags.\nCompany A should carefully scrutinize the relationship among Local Partner, Distributor, and Ministry of Immigration\nofficials. While there is nothing inherently illegal about contracting with a third party that is recommended by the end-user,\nor even hiring a government official to perform legitimate services on a transaction unrelated to his or her government\njob, these facts raise additional red flags that warrant significant scrutiny. Among other things, Company A would be\nwell-advised to require Principal 1 to verify that he will have no role in the Ministry of Immigration’s decision to award\nthe contract to Company A, notify the Ministry of Immigration and his own ministry of his proposed involvement in the\ntransaction, and certify that he will abide by the FCPA and other anti-corruption laws and that his involvement in the\ntransaction is permitted under local law.\n(cont’d)\n64\nAssume the following additional facts:\nUnder its company policy for a government transaction of this size, Company A requires both finance and compliance\napproval. The finance officer is concerned that the discounts to Distributor are significantly larger than what they have\napproved for similar work and will cut too deeply into Company A’s profit margin. The finance officer is also skeptical about\nincluding Local Partner to perform some of the same services that Company A is paying Distributor to perform. Unsatisfied\nwith Sales Executive’s explanation, she requests a meeting with Distributor and Principal 1. At the meeting, Distributor\nand Principal 1 offer vague and inconsistent justifications for the payments and fail to provide any supporting analysis, and\nPrincipal 1 seems to have no real expertise in the industry. During a coffee break, Distributor comments to Sales Executive\nthat the finance officer is naïve about “how business is done in my country.” Following the meeting, Sales Executive\ndismisses the finance officer’s concerns, assuring her that the proposed transaction structure is reasonable and legitimate.\nSales Executive also reminds the finance officer that “the deal is key to their growth in the industry.”\nThe compliance officer focuses his due diligence on vetting Distributor and Local Partner and hires a business investigative\nfirm to conduct a background check. Distributor appears reputable, capable, and financially stable and is willing to take on\nreal risk in the project, financial and otherwise. However, the compliance officer learns that Distributor has established an\noff-shore bank account for the transaction. The compliance officer further learns that Local Partner’s business was organized\ntwo years ago and appears financially stable but has no expertise in the industry and has established an off-shore shell\ncompany and bank account to conduct this transaction. The background check also reveals that Principal 1 is a former college\nroommate of a senior official of the Ministry of Immigration. The Sales Executive dismisses the compliance officer’s concerns,\ncommenting that what Local Partner does with its payments “isn’t our problem.” Sales Executive also strongly objects to the\ncompliance officer’s request to meet with Principal 1 to discuss the off-shore company and account, assuring him that it was\ndone for legitimate tax purposes and complaining that if Company A continues to “harass” Local Partner and Distributor, they\nwould partner with Company A’s chief competitor. The compliance officer and the finance officer discuss their concerns with\neach other but ultimately sign off on the deal even though their questions had not been answered. Their decision is motivated\nin large part by their conversation with Sales Executive, who told them that this was the region’s most important contract\nand that the detailed FCPA questionnaires and robust anti-corruption representations in the contracts placed the burden on\nDistributor and Local Partner to act ethically.\nCompany A goes forward with the Distributor and Local Partner agreements and wins the contract after six months. The\nfinance officer approves Company A’s payments to Local Partner via the offshore account, even though Local Partner’s invoices\ndid not contain supporting detail or documentation of any services provided. Company A recorded the payments as legitimate\noperational expenses on its books and records. Sales Executive received a large year-end bonus due to the award of the contract.\nIn fact, Local Partner and Distributor used part of the payments and discount margin, respectively, to funnel bribe payments\nto several Ministry of Immigration officials, including Principal 1’s former college roommate, in exchange for awarding the\ncontract to Company A. Thousands of dollars are also wired to the personal offshore bank account of Sales Executive.\nHow would DOJ and SEC evaluate the potential FCPA liability of Company A and its employees?\nThis is not the case of a single “rogue employee” circumventing an otherwise robust compliance program. Although\nCompany A’s finance and compliance officers had the correct instincts to scrutinize the structure and economics of the\ntransaction and the role of the third parties, their due diligence was incomplete. When the initial inquiry identified significant\nred flags, they approved the transaction despite knowing that their concerns were unanswered or the answers they received\nraised additional concerns and red flags. Relying on due diligence questionnaires and anti-corruption representations is\ninsufficient, particularly when the risks are readily apparent. Nor can Company A or its employees shield themselves from\nliability because it was Distributor and Local Partner—rather than Company A directly—that made the payments.\nThe facts suggest that Sales Executive had actual knowledge of or was willfully blind to the consultant’s payment of\nthe bribes. He also personally profited from the scheme (both from the kickback and from the bonus he received from the\ncompany) and intentionally discouraged the finance and compliance officers from learning the full story. Sales Executive is\ntherefore subject to liability under the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal controls provisions of the FCPA, and\nothers may be as well. Company A may also be liable for violations of the anti-bribery, books and records, and internal\ncontrols provisions of the FCPA given the number and significance of red flags that established a high probability of bribery\nand the role of employees and agents acting on the company’s behalf.\n65\nchapter 5\nGuiding Principles\nof Enforcement\n66\n\nchapter 6\nFCPA Penalties,\nSanctions, and\nRemedies\nFCPA PENALTIES, SANCTIONS,\nAND REMEDIES\nWhat Are the Potential Consequences\nfor Violations of the FCPA?\nThe FCPA provides for different criminal and civil\npenalties for companies and individuals.\nCriminal Penalties\nFor each violation of the anti-bribery provisions, the\nFCPA provides that corporations and other business entities\nare subject to a fine of up to $2 million. 341 Individuals,\nincluding officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of\ncompanies, are subject to a fine of up to $100,000 and\nimprisonment for up to five years. 342\nFor each violation of the accounting provisions, the\nFCPA provides that corporations and other business entities\nare subject to a fine of up to $25 million. 343 Individuals\nare subject to a fine of up to $5 million and imprisonment\nfor up to 20 years. 344\nUnder the Alternative Fines Act, 18 U.S.C. § 3571(d),\ncourts may impose significantly higher fines than those provided\nby the FCPA—up to twice the benefit that the defendant\nsought to obtain by making the corrupt payment, as\nlong as the facts supporting the increased fines are included\nin the indictment and either proved to the jury beyond a\nreasonable doubt or admitted in a guilty plea proceeding. 345\nFines imposed on individuals may not be paid by their\nemployer or principal. 346\nU.S. Sentencing Guidelines\nWhen calculating penalties for violations of the FCPA,\nDOJ focuses its analysis on the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines\n(Guidelines) 347 in all of its resolutions, including guilty pleas,\nDPAs, and NPAs. The Guidelines provide a very detailed and\npredictable structure for calculating penalties for all federal\ncrimes, including violations of the FCPA. To determine the\nappropriate penalty, the “offense level” is first calculated by\nexamining both the severity of the crime and facts specific to\nthe crime, with appropriate reductions for cooperation and\nacceptance of responsibility, and, for business entities, additional\nfactors such as voluntary disclosure, cooperation, preexisting\ncompliance programs, and remediation.\nThe Guidelines provide for different penalties for the\ndifferent provisions of the FCPA. The initial offense level\nfor violations of the anti-bribery provisions is determined\nunder § 2C1.1, while violations of the accounting provisions\nare assessed under § 2B1.1. For individuals, the initial\noffense level is modified by factors set forth in Chapters 3,\n4, and 5 of the Guidelines 348 to identify a final offense level.\nThis final offense level, combined with other factors, is used\n68\nto determine whether the Guidelines would recommend\nthat incarceration is appropriate, the length of any term of\nincarceration, and the appropriate amount of any fine. For\ncorporations, the offense level is modified by factors particular\nto organizations as described in Chapter 8 to determine\nthe applicable organizational penalty.\nFor example, violations of the anti-bribery provisions\nare calculated pursuant to § 2C1.1. The offense level\nis determined by first identifying the base offense level; 349\nadding additional levels based on specific offense characteristics,\nincluding whether the offense involved more than\none bribe, the value of the bribe or the benefit that was conferred,\nand the level of the public official; 350 adjusting the\noffense level based on the defendant’s role in the offense; 351\nand using the total offense level as well as the defendant’s\ncriminal history category to determine the advisory guideline\nrange. 352 For violations of the accounting provisions\nassessed under § 2B1.1, the procedure is generally the\nsame, except that the specific offense characteristics differ.\nFor instance, for violations of the FCPA’s accounting provisions,\nthe offense level may be increased if a substantial\npart of the scheme occurred outside the United States or if\nthe defendant was an officer or director of a publicly traded\ncompany at the time of the offense. 353\nFor companies, the offense level is calculated pursuant\nto §§ 2C1.1 or 2B1.1 in the same way as for an\nindividual—by starting with the base offense level and\nincreasing it as warranted by any applicable specific\noffense characteristics. The organizational guidelines\nfound in Chapter 8, however, provide the structure for\ndetermining the final advisory guideline fine range for\norganizations. The base fine consists of the greater of the\namount corresponding to the total offense level, calculated\npursuant to the Guidelines, or the pecuniary gain or\nloss from the offense. 354 This base fine is then multiplied\nby a culpability score that can either reduce the fine to as\nlittle as five percent of the base fine or increase the recommended\nfine to up to four times the amount of the base\nfine. 355 As described in § 8C2.5, this culpability score is\ncalculated by taking into account numerous factors such\nas the size of the organization committing the criminal\nacts; the involvement in or tolerance of criminal activity\nby high-level personnel within the organization; and\nprior misconduct or obstructive behavior. The culpability\nscore is reduced if the organization had an effective preexisting\ncompliance program to prevent violations and if\nthe organization voluntarily disclosed the offense, cooperated\nin the investigation, and accepted responsibility for\nthe criminal conduct. 356\nCivil Penalties\nAlthough only DOJ has the authority to pursue criminal\nactions, both DOJ and SEC have civil enforcement\nauthority under the FCPA. DOJ may pursue civil actions\nfor anti-bribery violations by domestic concerns (and their\nofficers, directors, employees, agents, or stockholders) and\nforeign nationals and companies for violations while in the\nUnited States, while SEC may pursue civil actions against\nissuers and their officers, directors, employees, agents, or\nstockholders for violations of the anti-bribery and the\naccounting provisions. 357\nFor violations of the anti-bribery provisions, corporations\nand other business entities are subject to a civil\npenalty of up to $16,000 per violation. 358 Individuals,\nincluding officers, directors, stockholders, and agents of\ncompanies, are similarly subject to a civil penalty of up to\n$16,000 per violation, 359 which may not be paid by their\nemployer or principal. 360\nFor violations of the accounting provisions, SEC may\nobtain a civil penalty not to exceed the greater of (a) the\ngross amount of the pecuniary gain to the defendant as a\nresult of the violations or (b) a specified dollar limitation.\nThe specified dollar limitations are based on the egregiousness\nof the violation, ranging from $7,500 to $150,000 for\nan individual and $75,000 to $725,000 for a company. 361\nSEC may obtain civil penalties both in actions filed in federal\ncourt and in administrative proceedings. 362\nCollateral Consequences\nIn addition to the criminal and civil penalties described\nabove, individuals and companies who violate the FCPA may\nface significant collateral consequences, including suspension\n69\nor debarment from contracting with the federal government,\ncross-debarment by multilateral development banks, and the\nsuspension or revocation of certain export privileges.\nDebarment\nUnder federal guidelines governing procurement,\nan individual or company that violates the FCPA or other\ncriminal statutes may be barred from doing business with the\nfederal government. The Federal Acquisition Regulations\n(FAR) provide for the potential suspension or debarment\nof companies that contract with the government upon\nconviction of or civil judgment for bribery, falsification or\ndestruction of records, the making of false statements, or\n“[c]ommission of any other offense indicating a lack of business\nintegrity or business honesty that seriously and directly\naffects the present responsibility of a Government contractor\nor subcontractor.” 363 These measures are not intended\nto be punitive and may be imposed only if “in the public’s\ninterest for the Government’s protection.” 364\nUnder the FAR, a decision to debar or suspend is discretionary.\nThe decision is not made by DOJ prosecutors or\nSEC staff, but instead by independent debarment authorities\nwithin each agency, such as the Department of Defense or\nthe General Services Administration, which analyze a number\nof factors to determine whether a company should be suspended,\ndebarred, or otherwise determined to be ineligible\nfor government contracting. Such factors include whether\nthe contractor has effective internal control systems in place,\nself-reported the misconduct in a timely manner, and has\ntaken remedial measures. 365 If a cause for debarment exists,\nthe contractor has the burden of demonstrating to the satisfaction\nof the debarring official that it is presently responsible\nand that debarment is not necessary. 366 Each federal department\nand agency determines the eligibility of contractors\nwith whom it deals. However, if one department or agency\ndebars or suspends a contractor, the debarment or suspension\napplies to the entire executive branch of the federal government,\nunless a department or agency shows compelling reasons\nnot to debar or suspend the contractor. 367\nAlthough guilty pleas, DPAs, and NPAs do not result\nin automatic debarment from U.S. government contracting,\nchapter 6\nFCPA Penalties,\nSanctions, and\nRemedies\ncommitting a federal crime and the factual admissions\nunderlying a resolution are factors that the independent\ndebarment authorities may consider. Moreover, indictment\nalone can lead to suspension of the right to do business\nwith the government. 368 The U.S. Attorney’s Manual also\nprovides that when a company engages in fraud against the\ngovernment, a prosecutor may not negotiate away an agency’s\nright to debar or delist the company as part of the plea\nbargaining process. 369 In making debarment determinations,\ncontracting agencies, including at the state and local\nlevel, may consult with DOJ in advance of awarding a contract.\nDepending on the circumstances, DOJ may provide\ninformation to contracting authorities in the context of\nthe corporate settlement about the facts and circumstances\nunderlying the criminal conduct and remediation measures\nundertaken by the company, if any. This information sharing\nis not advocacy, and the ultimate debarment decisions\nare squarely within the purview of the independent debarment\nauthorities. In some situations, the contracting agency\nmay impose its own oversight requirements in order for a\ncompany that has admitted to violations of federal law to be\nawarded federal contracts, such as the Corporate Integrity\nAgreements often required by the Department of Health\nand Human Services.\nCross-Debarment by Multilateral Development\nBanks\nMultilateral Development Banks (MDBs), like the\nWorld Bank, also have the ability to debar companies and\nindividuals for corrupt practices. 370 Each MDB has its own\nprocess for evaluating alleged corruption in connection\nwith MDB-funded projects. When appropriate, DOJ and\nSEC work with MDBs to share evidence and refer cases.\nOn April 9, 2010, the African Development Bank Group,\nthe Asian Development Bank, the European Bank for\n70\nReconstruction and Development, the Inter-American\nDevelopment Bank Group, and the World Bank Group\nentered into an agreement under which entities debarred\nby one MDB will be sanctioned for the same misconduct\nby other signatory MDBs. 371 This cross-debarment agreement\nmeans that if a company is debarred by one MDB, it\nis debarred by all. 372\nLoss of Export Privileges\nCompanies and individuals who violate the FCPA\nmay face consequences under other regulatory regimes,\nsuch as the Arms Export Control Act (AECA), 22 U.S.C.\n§ 2751, et seq., and its implementing regulations, the\nInternational Traffic in Arms Regulations (ITAR), 22\nC.F.R. § 120, et seq. AECA and ITAR together provide\nfor the suspension, revocation, amendment, or denial of an\narms export license if an applicant has been indicted or convicted\nfor violating the FCPA. 373 They also set forth certain\nfactors for the Department of State’s Directorate of Defense\nTrade Controls (DDTC) 374 to consider when determining\nwhether to grant, deny, or return without action license\napplications for certain types of defense materials. One of\nthose factors is whether there is reasonable cause to believe\nthat an applicant for a license has violated (or conspired\nto violate) the FCPA; if so, the Department of State “may\ndisapprove the application.” 375 In addition, it is the policy\nof the Department of State not to consider applications for\nlicenses involving any persons who have been convicted of\nviolating the AECA or convicted of conspiracy to violate\nthe AECA. 376 In an action related to the criminal resolution\nof a U.K. military products manufacturer, the DDTC\nimposed a “policy of denial” for export licenses on three of\nthe company’s subsidiaries that were involved in violations\nof AECA and ITAR. 377\nWhen Is a Compliance Monitor or\nIndependent Consultant Appropriate?\nOne of the primary goals of both criminal prosecutions\nand civil enforcement actions against companies that\nviolate the FCPA is ensuring that such conduct does not\noccur again. As a consequence, enhanced compliance and\nreporting requirements may be part of criminal and civil\nresolutions of FCPA matters. The amount of enhanced\ncompliance and kind of reporting required varies according\nto the facts and circumstances of individual cases.\nIn criminal cases, a company’s sentence, or a DPA or\nNPA with a company, may require the appointment of an\nindependent corporate monitor. Whether a monitor is\nappropriate depends on the specific facts and circumstances\nof the case. In 2008, DOJ issued internal guidance regarding\nthe selection and use of corporate monitors in DPAs\nand NPAs with companies. Additional guidance has since\nbeen issued. 378 A monitor is an independent third party who\nassesses and monitors a company’s adherence to the compliance\nrequirements of an agreement that was designed to\nreduce the risk of recurrence of the company’s misconduct.\nAppointment of a monitor is not appropriate in all circumstances,\nbut it may be appropriate, for example, where a company\ndoes not already have an effective internal compliance\nprogram or needs to establish necessary internal controls. In\naddition, companies are sometimes allowed to engage in selfmonitoring,\ntypically in cases when the company has made\na voluntary disclosure, has been fully cooperative, and has\ndemonstrated a genuine commitment to reform.\nFactors DOJ and SEC Consider\nWhen Determining Whether a Compliance\nMonitor Is Appropriate Include:\n• Seriousness of the offense\n• Duration of the misconduct\n• Pervasiveness of the misconduct, including\nwhether the conduct cuts across geographic and/\nor product lines\n• Nature and size of the company\n• Quality of the company’s compliance program at\nthe time of the misconduct\n• Subsequent remediation efforts\n71\nIn civil cases, a company may similarly be required\nto retain an independent compliance consultant or monitor\nto provide an independent, third-party review of the\ncompany’s internal controls. The consultant recommends\nimprovements, to the extent necessary, which the company\nmust adopt. When both DOJ and SEC require a company\nto retain a monitor, the two agencies have been able\nto coordinate their requirements so that the company can\nretain one monitor to fulfill both sets of requirements.\nThe most successful monitoring relationships are\nthose in which the company embraces the monitor or consultant.\nIf the company takes the recommendations and\nsuggestions seriously and uses the monitoring period as a\ntime to find and fix any outstanding compliance issues, the\ncompany can emerge from the monitorship with a stronger,\nlong-lasting compliance program.\nchapter 6\nFCPA Penalties,\nSanctions, and\nRemedies\n72\n\nchapter 7\nResolutions\nRESOLUTIONS\nWhat Are the Different Types of\nResolutions with DOJ?\nCriminal Complaints, Informations, and Indictments\nCharges against individuals and companies are\nbrought in three different ways under the Federal Rules of\nCriminal Procedure: criminal complaints, criminal informations,\nand indictments.\nDOJ may agree to resolve criminal FCPA matters\nagainst companies either through a declination or, in\nappropriate cases, a negotiated resolution resulting in a plea\nagreement, deferred prosecution agreement, or non-prosecution\nagreement. For individuals, a negotiated resolution\nwill generally take the form of a plea agreement, which may\ninclude language regarding cooperation, or a non-prosecution\ncooperation agreement. When negotiated resolutions\ncannot be reached with companies or individuals, the matter\nmay proceed to trial.\nPlea Agreements\nPlea agreements—whether with companies or\nindividuals—are governed by Rule 11 of the Federal\nRules of Criminal Procedure. The defendant generally\nadmits to the facts supporting the charges, admits\nguilt, and is convicted of the charged crimes when the\nplea agreement is presented to and accepted by a court.\nThe plea agreement may jointly recommend a sentence\nor fine, jointly recommend an analysis under the U.S.\nSentencing Guidelines, or leave such items open for\nargument at the time of sentencing.\nDeferred Prosecution Agreements\nUnder a deferred prosecution agreement, or a DPA\nas it is commonly known, DOJ files a charging document\nwith the court, 379 but it simultaneously requests that the\nprosecution be deferred, that is, postponed for the purpose\nof allowing the company to demonstrate its good\nconduct. DPAs generally require a defendant to agree to\npay a monetary penalty, waive the statute of limitations,\ncooperate with the government, admit the relevant facts,\nand enter into certain compliance and remediation commitments,\npotentially including a corporate compliance\nmonitor. DPAs describe the company’s conduct, cooperation,\nand remediation, if any, and provide a calculation of\nthe penalty pursuant to the U.S. Sentencing Guidelines.\nIn addition to being publicly filed, DOJ places all of its\nDPAs on its website. If the company successfully completes\nthe term of the agreement (typically two or three\nyears), DOJ will then move to dismiss the filed charges. A\ncompany’s successful completion of a DPA is not treated\nas a criminal conviction.\n74\nNon-Prosecution Agreements\nUnder a non-prosecution agreement, or an NPA as\nit is commonly known, DOJ maintains the right to file\ncharges but refrains from doing so to allow the company\nto demonstrate its good conduct during the term of the\nNPA. Unlike a DPA, an NPA is not filed with a court but is\ninstead maintained by the parties. In circumstances where\nan NPA is with a company for FCPA-related offenses, it is\nmade available to the public through DOJ’s website. The\nrequirements of an NPA are similar to those of a DPA,\nand generally require a waiver of the statute of limitations,\nongoing cooperation, admission of the material facts, and\ncompliance and remediation commitments, in addition to\npayment of a monetary penalty. If the company complies\nwith the agreement throughout its term, DOJ does not file\ncriminal charges. If an individual complies with the terms\nof his or her NPA, namely, truthful and complete cooperation\nand continued law-abiding conduct, DOJ will not pursue\ncriminal charges.\nDeclinations\nAs discussed above, DOJ’s decision to bring or decline\nto bring an enforcement action under the FCPA is made\npursuant to the Principles of Federal Prosecution, in the case\nof individuals, and the Principles of Federal Prosecution\nof Business Organizations, in the case of companies. As\ndescribed, in the case of individuals, the Principles of Federal\nProsecution advise prosecutors to weigh all relevant considerations,\nincluding:\n• federal law enforcement priorities;\n• the nature and seriousness of the offense;\n• the deterrent effect of prosecution;\n• the person’s culpability in connection with the\noffense;\n• the person’s history of criminal activity;\n• the person’s willingness to cooperate in the investigation\nor prosecution of others; and\n• the probable sentence or other consequences if the\nperson is convicted. 380\nThe Principles of Federal Prosecution provide additional\ncommentary about each of these factors. For\ninstance, they explain that prosecutors should take into\naccount federal law enforcement priorities because federal\nlaw enforcement and judicial resources are not sufficient\nto permit prosecution of every alleged offense over which\nfederal jurisdiction exists. The deterrent effect of prosecution\nshould also be kept in mind because some offenses,\n“although seemingly not of great importance by themselves,\nif commonly committed would have a substantial cumulative\nimpact on the community.” 381\nAs discussed above, the Principles of Federal\nProsecution of Business Organizations require prosecutors to\nconsider nine factors when determining whether to prosecute\na corporate entity for an FCPA violation, including the\nnature and seriousness of the offense; the pervasiveness of\nwrongdoing within the company; the company’s history of\nsimilar conduct; the existence and effectiveness of the company’s\npre-existing compliance program; and the adequacy\nof remedies, such as civil or regulatory enforcement actions.\nPursuant to these guidelines, DOJ has declined to\nprosecute both individuals and corporate entities in numerous\ncases based on the particular facts and circumstances\npresented in those matters, taking into account the available\nevidence. 382 To protect the privacy rights and other\ninterests of the uncharged and other potentially interested\nparties, DOJ has a long-standing policy not to provide,\nwithout the party’s consent, non-public information on\nmatters it has declined to prosecute. To put DOJ’s declinations\nin context, however, in the past two years alone, DOJ\nhas declined several dozen cases against companies where\npotential FCPA violations were alleged.\nAs mentioned above, there are rare occasions in\nwhich, in conjunction with the public filing of charges\nagainst an individual, it is appropriate to disclose that a\ncompany is not also being prosecuted. That was done in a\nrecent case where a former employee was charged but the\nformer corporate employer was not. 383\n75\nWhat Are the Different Types of\nResolutions with SEC?\nCivil Injunctive Actions and Remedies\nIn a civil injunctive action, SEC seeks a court order\ncompelling the defendant to obey the law in the future.\nViolating such an order can result in civil or criminal contempt\nproceedings. Civil contempt sanctions, brought by\nSEC, are remedial rather than punitive in nature and serve\none of two purposes: to compensate the party injured as a\nresult of the violation of the injunction or force compliance\nwith the terms of the injunction.\nWhere a defendant has profited from a violation of\nlaw, SEC can obtain the equitable relief of disgorgement\nof ill-gotten gains and pre-judgment interest and can also\nobtain civil money penalties pursuant to Sections 21(d)(3)\nand 32(c) of the Exchange Act. SEC may also seek ancillary\nrelief (such as an accounting from a defendant). Pursuant\nto Section 21(d)(5), SEC also may seek, and any federal\ncourt may grant, any other equitable relief that may be\nappropriate or necessary for the benefit of investors, such\nas enhanced remedial measures or the retention of an independent\ncompliance consultant or monitor.\nCivil Administrative Actions and Remedies\nSEC has the ability to institute various types of administrative\nproceedings against a person or an entity that it\nbelieves has violated the law. This type of enforcement action\nis brought by SEC’s Enforcement Division and is litigated\nbefore an SEC administrative law judge (ALJ). The ALJ’s\ndecision is subject to appeal directly to the Securities and\nExchange Commission itself, and the Commission’s decision\nis in turn subject to review by a U.S. Court of Appeals.\nAdministrative proceedings provide for a variety of\nrelief. For regulated persons and entities, such as brokerdealers\nand investment advisers and persons associated with\nthem, sanctions include censure, limitation on activities,\nsuspension of up to twelve months, and bar from association\nor revocation of registration. For professionals such as\nattorneys and accountants, SEC can order in Rule 102(e)\nchapter 7\nResolutions\nproceedings that the professional be censured, suspended,\nor barred from practicing before SEC. 384 SEC staff can seek\nan order from an administrative law judge requiring the\nrespondent to cease and desist from any current or future\nviolations of the securities laws. In addition, SEC can obtain\ndisgorgement, pre-judgment interest, and civil money penalties\nin administrative proceedings under Section 21B\nof the Exchange Act, and also can obtain other equitable\nrelief, such as enhanced remedial measures or the retention\nof an independent compliance consultant or monitor.\nDeferred Prosecution Agreements\nA deferred prosecution agreement is a written agreement\nbetween SEC and a potential cooperating individual\nor company in which SEC agrees to forego an enforcement\naction against the individual or company if the individual\nor company agrees to, among other things: (1) cooperate\ntruthfully and fully in SEC’s investigation and related\nenforcement actions; (2) enter into a long-term tolling\nagreement; (3) comply with express prohibitions and/\nor undertakings during a period of deferred prosecution;\nand (4) under certain circumstances, agree either to admit\nor not to contest underlying facts that SEC could assert\nto establish a violation of the federal securities laws. If the\nagreement is violated during the period of deferred prosecution,\nSEC staff may recommend an enforcement action to\nthe Commission against the individual or company for the\noriginal misconduct as well as any additional misconduct.\nFurthermore, if the Commission authorizes the enforcement\naction, SEC staff may use any factual admissions\nmade by the cooperating individual or company in support\nof a motion for summary judgment, while maintaining the\nability to bring an enforcement action for any additional\nmisconduct at a later date.\n76\nIn May of 2011, SEC entered into its first deferred\nprosecution agreement against a company for violating the\nFCPA. 385 In that case, a global manufacturer of steel pipe\nproducts violated the FCPA by bribing Uzbekistan government\nofficials during a bidding process to supply pipelines\nfor transporting oil and natural gas. The company made\nalmost $5 million in profits when it was subsequently\nawarded several contracts by the Uzbekistan government.\nThe company discovered the misconduct during a worldwide\nreview of its operations and brought it to the government’s\nattention. In addition to self-reporting, the company\nconducted a thorough internal investigation; provided\ncomplete, real-time cooperation with SEC and DOJ staff;\nand undertook extensive remediation, including enhanced\nanti-corruption procedures and training. Under the terms\nof the DPA, the company paid $5.4 million in disgorgement\nand prejudgment interest. The company also paid a\n$3.5 million monetary penalty to resolve a criminal investigation\nby DOJ through an NPA. 386\nFor further information about deferred prosecution\nagreements, see SEC’s Enforcement Manual. 387\nNon-Prosecution Agreements\nA non-prosecution agreement is a written agreement\nbetween SEC and a potential cooperating individual or company,\nentered into in limited and appropriate circumstances,\nthat provides that SEC will not pursue an enforcement\naction against the individual or company if the individual or\ncompany agrees to, among other things: (1) cooperate truthfully\nand fully in SEC’s investigation and related enforcement\nactions; and (2) comply, under certain circumstances,\nwith express undertakings. If the agreement is violated, SEC\nstaff retains its ability to recommend an enforcement action\nto the Commission against the individual or company.\nFor further information about non-prosecution\nagreements, see SEC’s Enforcement Manual. 388\nEnforcement Manual. The same factors that apply to SEC\nstaff ’s determination of whether to recommend an enforcement\naction against an individual or entity apply to the\ndecision to close an investigation without recommending\nenforcement action. 389\nGenerally, SEC staff considers, among other things:\n• the seriousness of the conduct and potential violations;\n• the resources available to SEC staff to pursue the\ninvestigation;\n• the sufficiency and strength of the evidence;\n• the extent of potential investor harm if an action is\nnot commenced; and\n• the age of the conduct underlying the potential\nviolations.\nSEC has declined to take enforcement action against\nboth individuals and companies based on the facts and circumstances\npresent in those matters, where, for example,\nthe conduct was not egregious, the company fully cooperated,\nand the company identified and remediated the\nmisconduct quickly. SEC Enforcement Division policy is\nto notify individuals and entities at the earliest opportunity\nwhen the staff has determined not to recommend an\nenforcement action against them to the Commission. This\nnotification takes the form of a termination letter.\nIn order to protect the privacy rights and other interests\nof the uncharged and other potentially interested parties,\nSEC does not provide non-public information on matters\nit has declined to prosecute.\nWhat Are Some Examples of Past\nDeclinations by DOJ and SEC?\nNeither DOJ nor SEC typically publicizes declinations\nbut, to provide some insight into the process, the following\nare recent, anonymized examples of matters DOJ\nand SEC have declined to pursue:\nTermination Letters and Declinations\nAs discussed above, SEC’s decision to bring or\ndecline to bring an enforcement action under the FCPA is\nmade pursuant to the guiding principles set forth in SEC’s\nExample 1: Public Company Declination\nDOJ and SEC declined to take enforcement action\nagainst a public U.S. company. Factors taken into consideration\nincluded:\n77\n• The company discovered that its employees had\nreceived competitor bid information from a third\nparty with connections to the foreign government.\n• The company began an internal investigation,\nwithdrew its contract bid, terminated the employees\ninvolved, severed ties to the third-party agent, and\nvoluntarily disclosed the conduct to DOJ’s Antitrust\nDivision, which also declined prosecution.\n• During the internal investigation, the company\nuncovered various FCPA red flags, including prior\nconcerns about the third-party agent, all of which\nthe company voluntarily disclosed to DOJ and SEC.\n• The company immediately took substantial steps to\nimprove its compliance program.\nExample 2: Public Company Declination\nDOJ and SEC declined to take enforcement action\nagainst a public U.S. company. Factors taken into consideration\nincluded:\n• With knowledge of employees of the company’s\nsubsidiary, a retained construction company\npaid relatively small bribes, which were wrongly\napproved by the company’s local law firm, to foreign\nbuilding code inspectors.\n• When the company’s compliance department\nlearned of the bribes, it immediately ended the\nconduct, terminated its relationship with the construction\ncompany and law firm, and terminated or\ndisciplined the employees involved.\n• The company completed a thorough internal investigation\nand voluntarily disclosed to DOJ and SEC.\n• The company reorganized its compliance department,\nappointed a new compliance officer dedicated\nto anti-corruption, improved the training\nand compliance program, and undertook a\nreview of all of the company’s international thirdparty\nrelationships.\nExample 3: Public Company Declination\nDOJ and SEC declined to take enforcement action\nagainst a U.S. publicly held industrial services company for\nchapter 7\nResolutions\nbribes paid by a small foreign subsidiary. Factors taken into\nconsideration included:\n• The company self-reported the conduct to DOJ\nand SEC.\n• The total amount of the improper payments was\nrelatively small, and the activity appeared to be\nan isolated incident by a single employee at the\nsubsidiary.\n• The profits potentially obtained from the improper\npayments were very small.\n• The payments were detected by the company’s\nexisting internal controls. The company’s audit\ncommittee conducted a thorough independent\ninternal investigation. The results of the investigation\nwere provided to the government.\n• The company cooperated fully with investigations\nby DOJ and SEC.\n• The company implemented significant remedial\nactions and enhanced its internal control structure.\nExample 4: Public Company Declination\nDOJ and SEC declined to take enforcement action\nagainst a U.S. publicly held oil-and-gas services company\nfor small bribes paid by a foreign subsidiary’s customs agent.\nFactors taken into consideration included:\n• The company’s internal controls timely detected a\npotential bribe before a payment was made.\n• When company management learned of the\npotential bribe, management immediately reported\nthe issue to the company’s General Counsel and\nAudit Committee and prevented the payment from\noccurring.\n• Within weeks of learning of the attempted bribe,\nthe company provided in-person FCPA training\nto employees of the subsidiary and undertook\n78\nan extensive internal investigation to determine\nwhether any of the company’s subsidiaries in the\nsame region had engaged in misconduct.\n• The company self-reported the misconduct and the\nresults of its internal investigation to DOJ and SEC.\n• The company cooperated fully with investigations\nby DOJ and SEC.\n• In addition to the immediate training at the relevant\nsubsidiary, the company provided comprehensive\nFCPA training to all of its employees and conducted\nan extensive review of its anti-corruption compliance\nprogram.\n• The company enhanced its internal controls and\nrecord-keeping policies and procedures, including\nrequiring periodic internal audits of customs\npayments.\n• As part of its remediation, the company directed that\nlocal lawyers rather than customs agents be used to\nhandle its permits, with instructions that “no matter\nwhat, we don’t pay bribes”—a policy that resulted in\na longer and costlier permit procedure.\nExample 5: Public Company Declination\nDOJ and SEC declined to take enforcement action\nagainst a U.S. publicly held consumer products company\nin connection with its acquisition of a foreign company.\nFactors taken into consideration included:\n• The company identified the potential improper\npayments to local government officials as part of its\npre-acquisition due diligence.\n• The company promptly developed a comprehensive\nplan to investigate, correct, and remediate any\nFCPA issues after acquisition.\n• The company promptly self-reported the issues prior\nto acquisition and provided the results of its investigation\nto the government on a real-time basis.\n• The acquiring company’s existing internal controls\nand compliance program were robust.\n• After the acquisition closed, the company implemented\na comprehensive remedial plan, ensured\nthat all improper payments stopped, provided\nextensive FCPA training to employees of the new\nsubsidiary, and promptly incorporated the new\nsubsidiary into the company’s existing internal\ncontrols and compliance environment.\nExample 6: Private Company Declination\nIn 2011, DOJ declined to take prosecutorial action\nagainst a privately held U.S. company and its foreign subsidiary.\nFactors taken into consideration included:\n• The company voluntarily disclosed bribes paid to\nsocial security officials in a foreign country.\n• The total amount of the bribes was small.\n• When discovered, the corrupt practices were immediately\nterminated.\n• The conduct was thoroughly investigated, and the\nresults of the investigation were promptly provided\nto DOJ.\n• All individuals involved were either terminated\nor disciplined. The company also terminated its\nrelationship with its foreign law firm.\n• The company instituted improved training and\ncompliance programs commensurate with its size\nand risk exposure.\n79\nchapter 7\nResolutions\n80\n\nchapter 8\nWhistleblower\nProvisions and\nProtections\nWHISTLEBLOWER PROVISIONS\nAND PROTECTIONS\nAssistance and information from a whistleblower who knows of possible securities\nlaw violations can be among the most powerful weapons in the law enforcement\narsenal. Through their knowledge of the circumstances and individuals\ninvolved, whistleblowers can help SEC and DOJ identify potential violations\nmuch earlier than might otherwise have been possible, thus allowing SEC and\nDOJ to minimize the harm to investors, better preserve the integrity of the\nU.S. capital markets, and more swiftly hold accountable those responsible for\nunlawful conduct.\nThe Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the Dodd-Frank\nAct of 2010 both contain provisions affecting whistleblowers\nwho report FCPA violations. Sarbanes-Oxley prohibits\nissuers from retaliating against whistleblowers and provides\nthat employees who are retaliated against for reporting possible\nsecurities law violations may file a complaint with the\nDepartment of Labor, for which they would be eligible to\nreceive reinstatement, back pay, and other compensation. 390\nSarbanes-Oxley also prohibits retaliation against employee\nwhistleblowers under the obstruction of justice statute. 391\nIn 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act added Section 21F to\nthe Exchange Act, addressing whistleblower incentives and\nprotections. Section 21F authorizes SEC to provide monetary\nawards to eligible individuals who voluntarily come\nforward with high quality, original information that leads\nto an SEC enforcement action in which over $1,000,000 in\nsanctions is ordered. 392 The awards range is between 10%\nand 30% of the monetary sanctions recovered by the government.\nThe Dodd-Frank Act also prohibits employers\nfrom retaliating against whistleblowers and creates a private\nright of action for employees who are retaliated against. 393\nFurthermore, businesses should be aware that retaliation\nagainst a whistleblower may also violate state, local,\nand foreign laws that provide protection of whistleblowers.\n82\nOn August 12, 2011, the final rules for SEC’s\nWhistleblower Program became effective. These rules set\nforth the requirements for whistleblowers to be eligible for\nawards consideration, the factors that SEC will use to determine\nthe amount of the award, the categories of individuals\nwho are excluded from award consideration, and the categories\nof individuals who are subject to limitations in award\nconsiderations. 394 The final rules strengthen incentives for\nemployees to report the suspected violations internally\nthrough internal compliance programs when appropriate,\nalthough it does not require an employee to do so in order\nto qualify for an award. 395\nIndividuals with information about a possible violation\nof the federal securities laws, including FCPA violations,\nshould submit that information to SEC either online\nthrough SEC’s Tips, Complaints, and Referrals (TCR)\nIntake and Resolution System (available at https://denebleo.sec.gov/TCRExternal/disclaimer.xhtml)\nor by mailing\nor faxing a completed Form TCR to the Commission’s\nOffice of the Whistleblower.\nWhistleblowers can submit information anonymously.\nTo be considered under SEC’s whistleblower program\nas eligible for a reward, however, the information\nmust be submitted on an anonymous whistleblower’s behalf\nby an attorney. 396 Whether or not a whistleblower reports\nanonymously, SEC is committed to protecting the identity\nof a whistleblower to the fullest extent possible under the\nstatute. 397 SEC’s Office of the Whistleblower administers\nSEC’s Whistleblower Program and answers questions from\nthe public regarding the program. Additional information\nregarding SEC’s Whistleblower Program, including\nanswers to frequently asked questions, is available online at\nhttp://www.sec.gov/whistleblower.\nSEC Office of the Whistleblower\n100 F Street NE, Mail Stop 5971\nWashington, DC 20549\nFacsimile: (703) 813-9322\nOnline Report Form: http://www.sec.gov/\nwhistleblower\n83\nchapter 8\nWhistleblower\nProvisions and\nProtections\n84\n\nchapter 9\nDOJ Opinion\nProcedure\nDOJ OPINION PROCEDURE\nDOJ’s opinion procedure is a valuable mechanism for companies and individuals\nto determine whether proposed conduct would be prosecuted by DOJ\nunder the FCPA. 398 Generally speaking, under the opinion procedure process,\nparties submit information to DOJ, after which DOJ issues an opinion about\nwhether the proposed conduct falls within its enforcement policy. All of DOJ’s\nprior opinions are available online. 399 Parties interested in obtaining such an\nopinion should follow these steps: 400\nFirst, those seeking an opinion should evaluate whether\ntheir question relates to actual, prospective conduct. 401 The\nopinion procedure cannot be used to obtain opinions on\npurely historical conduct or on hypothetical questions. DOJ\nwill not consider a request unless that portion of the transaction\nfor which an opinion is sought involves only prospective\nconduct, although the transaction as a whole may have components\nthat already have occurred. An executed contract\nis not a prerequisite and, in most—if not all—instances, an\nopinion request should be made before the requestor commits\nto proceed with a transaction. 402 Those seeking requests\nshould be aware that FCPA opinions relate only to the\nFCPA’s anti-bribery provisions. 403\nSecond, before making the request, the company or\nindividual should check that they are either an issuer or a\ndomestic concern, as only those categories of parties can\nreceive an opinion. 404 If the transaction involves more than\none issuer or domestic concern, consider making a request\nfor an opinion jointly, as opinions only apply to the parties\nthat request them. 405\nThird, those seeking an opinion must put their request\nin writing. The request must be specific and accompanied\nby all relevant and material information bearing on the conduct\nand circumstances for which an opinion is requested.\nMaterial information includes background information,\ncomplete copies of all operative documents, and detailed\nstatements of all collateral or oral understandings, if any.\nThose seeking opinions are under an affirmative obligation\nto make full and true disclosures. 406 Materials disclosed to\nDOJ will not be made public without the consent of the\nparty submitting them. 407\n86\nFourth, the request must be signed. For corporate\nrequestors, the signatory should be an appropriate senior\nofficer with operational responsibility for the conduct that is\nthe subject of the request and who has been designated by the\ncorporation’s chief executive officer. In appropriate cases, DOJ\nalso may require the chief executive officer to sign the request.\nThose signing the request must certify that it contains a true,\ncorrect, and complete disclosure with respect to the proposed\nconduct and the circumstances of the conduct. 408\nFifth, an original and five copies of the request should\nbe addressed to the Assistant Attorney General in charge of\nthe Criminal Division, Attention: FCPA Opinion Group. 409\nThe mailing address is P.O. Box 28188 Central Station,\nWashington, D.C. 20038. DOJ also asks that you send an\nelectronic courtesy copy to FCPA.Fraud@usdoj.gov.\nDOJ will evaluate the request for an FCPA opinion. 410\nA party may withdraw a request for an opinion at any time\nprior to the release of an opinion. 411 If the request is complete\nand all the relevant information has been submitted, DOJ will\nrespond to the request by issuing an opinion within 30 days. 412\nIf the request is incomplete, DOJ will identify for the requestor\nwhat additional information or documents are required for\nDOJ to review the request. Such information must be provided\nto DOJ promptly. Once the additional information has\nbeen received, DOJ will issue an opinion within 30 days of\nreceipt of that additional information. 413 DOJ’s FCPA opinions\nstate whether, for purposes of DOJ’s present enforcement\npolicy, the prospective conduct would violate either the issuer\nor domestic concern anti-bribery provisions of the FCPA. 414\nDOJ also may take other positions in the opinion as it considers\nappropriate. 415 To the extent that the opinion concludes\nthat the proposed conduct would not violate the FCPA, a\nrebuttable presumption is created that the requestor’s conduct\nthat was the basis of the opinion is in compliance with\nthe FCPA. 416 In order to provide non-binding guidance to the\nbusiness community, DOJ makes versions of its opinions publicly\navailable on its website. 417\nIf, after receiving an opinion, a party is concerned about\nprospective conduct that is beyond the scope of conduct specified\nin a previous request, the party may submit an additional\nrequest for an opinion using the procedures outlined above. 418\n87\nchapter 9\nDOJ Opinion\nProcedure\n88\n\nchapter 10\nConclusion\nCONCLUSION\nThe FCPA was designed to prevent corrupt practices, protect investors,\nand provide a fair playing field for those honest companies trying to win business\nbased on quality and price rather than bribes. Following Congress’ leadership\nin enacting the FCPA 35 years ago, and through determined international\ndiplomatic and law enforcement efforts in the time since, laws like the FCPA\nprohibiting foreign bribery have been enacted by most of the United States’\nmajor trading partners.\nThis guide is designed to provide practical advice about, and useful insights\ninto, our enforcement considerations. For businesses desiring to compete\nfairly in foreign markets, it is our goal to maximize those businesses’ ability\nto comply with the FCPA in the most effective and efficient way suitable to their\nbusiness and the markets in which they operate. Through our ongoing efforts\nwith the U.S. and international business and legal communities and nongovernmental\norganizations, DOJ and SEC can continue effectively to protect\nthe integrity of our markets and reduce corruption around the world.\n90\n\nAPPENDIX\nThe Foreign\nCorrupt\nPractices Act\nTHE FOREIGN CORRUPT\nPRACTICES ACT:\n15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-1, 78dd-2, 78dd-3, 78m, 78ff\n15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1 [Section 30A of the Securities Exchange Act of\n1934] Prohibited foreign trade practices by issuers\n(a) Prohibition\nIt shall be unlawful for any issuer which has a class of securities registered\npursuant to section 78l of this title or which is required to file\nreports under section 78o(d) of this title, or for any officer, director,\nemployee, or agent of such issuer or any stockholder thereof acting\non behalf of such issuer, to make use of the mails or any means or\ninstrumentality of interstate commerce corruptly in furtherance of an\noffer, payment, promise to pay, or authorization of the payment of any\nmoney, or offer, gift, promise to give, or authorization of the giving of\nanything of value to—\n(1) any foreign official for purposes of—\n(A) (i) influencing any act or decision of such foreign official in his\nofficial capacity, (ii) inducing such foreign official to do or omit to do\nany act in violation of the lawful duty of such official, or (iii) securing\nany improper advantage;

The House Report made clear\nCongress’s concerns:\nThe payment of bribes to influence the acts or\ndecisions of foreign officials, foreign political parties\nor candidates for foreign political office is unethical.\nIt is counter to the moral expectations and values of\nthe American public. But not only is it unethical, it\nis bad business as well. It erodes public confidence\nin the integrity of the free market system. It shortcircuits\nthe marketplace by directing business to\nthose companies too inefficient to compete in terms\nof price, quality or service, or too lazy to engage in\nhonest salesmanship, or too intent upon unloading\nmarginal products. In short, it rewards corruption\ninstead of efficiency and puts pressure on ethical\nenterprises to lower their standards or risk losing\nbusiness.\nId.\n3\nSee, e.g., U.S. Agency for Int’l Dev., USAID Anticorruption\nStrategy 5-6 (2005), available at http://transition.usaid.gov/policy/\nads/200/200mbo.pdf. The growing recognition that corruption poses\na severe threat to domestic and international security has galvanized\nefforts to combat it in the United States and abroad. See, e.g., Int’l Anti-\nCorruption and Good Governance Act of 2000, Pub. L. No. 106-309,\n§ 202, 114 Stat. 1090 (codified as amended at 22 U.S.C. §§ 2151-2152\n(2000)) (noting that “[w]idespread corruption endangers the stability\nand security of societies, undermines democracy, and jeopardizes the\nsocial, political, and economic development of a society. . . .

The more endemic the corruption is, the more\nlikely it is to be accompanied by other serious deficiencies in the rule of\nlaw: smuggling, drug trafficking, criminal violence, human rights abuses,\nand personalization of power.”).\n5\nPresident George W. Bush observed in 2006 that “the culture of\ncorruption has undercut development and good governance and\n. . . . impedes our efforts to promote freedom and democracy, end\npoverty, and combat international crime and terrorism.” President’s\nStatement on Kleptocracy, 2 Pub.

For instance,\nin issuing a proclamation restricting the entry of certain corrupt foreign\npublic officials, former President George W.

Kay, 359 F.3d 738, 755-56 (5th Cir. 2004).\n70\nId. at 749. Indeed, the Kay court found that Congress’ explicit\nexclusion of facilitation payments from the scope of the FCPA was\nevidence that “Congress intended for the FCPA to prohibit all other\nillicit payments that are intended to influence non-trivial official foreign\naction in an effort to aid in obtaining or retaining business for some\nperson.” Id. at 749-50 (emphasis added).\n71\nId. at 750.\n72\nId. at 749-55.\n73\nId. at 756 (“It still must be shown that the bribery was intended to\nproduce an effect—here, through tax savings—that would ‘assist in\nobtaining or retaining business.’”).\n74\nThe FCPA does not explicitly define “corruptly,” but in drafting the\nstatute Congress adopted the meaning ascribed to the same term in the\ndomestic bribery statute, 18 U.S.C. § 201(b). See H.R. Rep. No. 95-640,\nat 7.\n75\nThe House Report states in full:\nThe word “corruptly” is used in order to make\nclear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must\nbe intended to induce the recipient to misuse\nhis official position; for example, wrongfully to\ndirect business to the payor or his client, to obtain\npreferential legislation or regulations, or to induce a\nforeign official to fail to perform an official function.\nThe word “corruptly” connotes an evil motive or\npurpose such as that required under 18 U.S.C.\n201(b) which prohibits domestic bribery. As in\n18 U.S.C. 201(b), the word “corruptly” indicates\nan intent or desire wrongfully to influence the\nrecipient. It does not require that the act [be] fully\nconsummated or succeed in producing the desired\noutcome.\nId. The Senate Report provides a nearly identical explanation of the\nmeaning of the term:\nThe word “corruptly” is used in order to make\nclear that the offer, payment, promise, or gift, must\nbe intended to induce the recipient to misuse\nhis official position in order to wrongfully direct\nbusiness to the payor or his client, or to obtain\n107\npreferential legislation or a favorable regulation.\nThe word “corruptly” connotes an evil motive or\npurpose, an intent to wrongfully influence the\nrecipient.\nS.

See, e.g.,\nUnited States v. Moore, 525 F.3d 1033, 1048 (11th Cir. 2008) (rejecting\ndefendant’s objection to instruction defining sex as a “thing of value,”\nwhich “unambiguously covers intangible considerations”); United\nStates v.

Franco, 632 F.3d 880, 882-84 (5th Cir. 2011)\n(affirming bribery convictions of inmate for paying correctional officer\n$325 to obtain cell phone, food, and marijuana, and noting that 18\nU.S.C. § 201 does not contain minimum monetary threshold); United\nStates v.

See, e.g., U.S. Dept. of Justice, FCPA Rev. P. Release\n83-02 ( July 26, 1983) (declining to take enforcement action against\ncompany seeking to provide promotional tour for foreign official and\nwife, where both had already planned a trip to the United States at their\nown expense and company proposed to pay only for all reasonable and\nnecessary actual domestic expenses for the extension of their travel to\nallow the promotional tour, which would not exceed $5,000), available at\nhttp://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/review/1983/r8302.pdf.\n159\nUnlike the local law and bona fide expenditures defenses, the\nfacilitating payments exception is not an affirmative defense to the\nFCPA. Rather, payments of this kind fall outside the scope of the\nFCPA’s bribery prohibition. Prior to 1988, the “facilitating payments”\nexception was incorporated into the definition of “foreign official,” which\nexcluded from the statute’s purview officials whose duties were primarily\nministerial or clerical. See Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977, Pub.\nL. No. 95-213, § 104(d)(2), 91 Stat. 1494, 1498 (1977) (providing that\nthe term foreign official “does not include any employee of a foreign\ngovernment or any department, agency, or instrumentality thereof whose\nduties are essentially ministerial or clerical”). The original exception thus\nfocused on the duties of the recipient, rather than the purpose of the\npayment. In practice, however, it proved difficult to determine whether\na foreign official’s duties were “ministerial or clerical.” S. Rep. No. 100-\n85, at 53. Responding to criticism that the statutory language “does not\nclearly reflect Congressional intent and the boundaries of the prohibited\nconduct,” Congress revised the FCPA to define the exception in terms of\nthe purpose of the payment. H. Rep. No. 100-40, pt. 2, at 77. In doing so,\nCongress reiterated that while its policy to exclude facilitating payments\nreflected practical considerations of enforcement, “such payments should\nnot be condoned.” Id. The enacted language reflects this narrow purpose.\n160\nIn exempting facilitating payments, Congress sought to distinguish\nthem as “payments which merely move a particular matter toward an\neventual act or decision or which do not involve any discretionary action,”\ngiving the examples of “a gratuity paid to a customs official to speed the\nprocessing of a customs document” or “payments made to secure permits,\nlicenses, or the expeditious performance of similar duties of an essentially\nministerial or clerical nature which must of necessity be performed in any\nevent.” H.R. Rep. No. 95-640, at 8.\n161\nSection 30A(f )(3)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78dd-1(f )(3)\n(B); 15 U.S.C. §§ 78dd-2(h)(4)(B), 78dd-3(f )(4)(B).\n162\nIn a 2004 decision, the Fifth Circuit emphasized this precise point,\ncommenting on the limited nature of the facilitating payments exception:\nA brief review of the types of routine governmental\nactions enumerated by Congress shows how limited\nCongress wanted to make the grease exceptions.\nRoutine governmental action, for instance, includes\n“obtaining permits, licenses, or other official\ndocuments to qualify a person to do business in\na foreign country,” and “scheduling inspections\nassociated with contract performance or inspections\nrelated to transit of goods across country.”\nTherefore, routine governmental action does not\ninclude the issuance of every official document or\nevery inspection, but only (1) documentation that\nqualifies a party to do business and (2) scheduling an\ninspection—very narrow categories of largely nondiscretionary,\nministerial activities performed by\nmid- or low-level foreign functionaries.\nUnited States v.

For example, in one instance, a Kazakh\nimmigration prosecutor threatened to fine, jail, or deport employees\nof a U.S. company’s subsidiary. Believing the threats to be genuine, the\nemployees in Kazakhstan sought guidance from senior management\nof the U.S. subsidiary and were authorized to make the payments. The\nemployees then paid the government official a total of $45,000 using\npersonal funds. The subsidiary reimbursed the employees, but it falsely\nrecorded the reimbursements as “salary advances” or “visa fines.” The\nparent company, which eventually discovered these payments, as well\nas other improperly booked cash payments made to a Kazakhstani\nconsultant to obtain visas, was charged with civil violations of the\naccounting provisions.

When evaluating the pervasiveness of wrongdoing\nwithin the corporation, prosecutors are advised that while it may be\nappropriate to charge a corporation for minor misconduct where the\nwrongdoing was pervasive, “it may not be appropriate to impose liability\nupon a corporation, particularly one with a robust compliance program in\nplace, under a strict respondeat superior theory for the single isolated act\nof a rogue employee.” Id. § 9-28.500.A (emphasis added). Prosecutors\nshould also consider a company’s compliance program when examining\nany remedial actions taken, including efforts to implement an effective\ncompliance program or to improve an existing one. As the commentary\nexplains, “although the inadequacy of a corporate compliance program is\na factor to consider when deciding whether to charge a corporation, that\ncorporation’s quick recognition of the flaws in the program and its efforts\nto improve the program are also factors to consider as to appropriate\ndisposition of a case.” Id. § 9-28.900.B. Finally, the Principles of Federal\nProsecution of Business Organizations provides that prosecutors should\nconsider the existence and effectiveness of the corporation’s pre-existing\ncompliance program in determining how to treat a corporate target.

The new provision defines “original\ninformation” to mean information that:\n(A) is derived from the independent knowledge\nor analysis of a whistleblower; (B) is not known\nto the Commission from any other source, unless\nthe whistleblower is the original source of the\ninformation; and (C) is not exclusively derived from\nan allegation made in a judicial or administrative\nhearing, in a governmental report, hearing, audit,\nor investigation, or from the news media, unless the\nwhistleblower is a source of the information.\n393\n15 U.S.C. § 78u-6; see also Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and\nConsumer Protection Act, Pub.

However,\nthere are limits on SEC’s ability to shield a whistleblower’s identity,\nand in certain circumstances SEC must disclose it to outside entities.\nFor example, in an administrative or court proceeding, SEC may be\nrequired to produce documents or other information that would\nreveal the whistleblower’s identity. In addition, as part of ongoing\nSEC investigatory responsibilities, SEC staff may use information\nprovided by a whistleblower during the course of the investigation. In\nappropriate circumstances, SEC may also provide information, subject\nto confidentiality requirements, to other governmental or regulatory\nentities.

SEC Release No. 34-\n17099 stated that, to encourage issuers to take advantage of the DOJ’s\nFCPA Review Procedure, as a matter of prosecutorial discretion, SEC\nwould “not take enforcement action alleging violations of Section 30A\nin any case where an issuer has sought and obtained an FCPA Review\nletter from the Department, prior to May 31, 1981, stating that the\nDepartment will not take enforcement action under Section 30A with\nrespect to the transaction involved.” Id. The release further noted that it\nwould revisit this policy once the DOJ had evaluated the results of the\nFCPA Review Procedure after its first year of operation. A second release\nstated that the SEC would continue to adhere to the policy announced\nin Release No. 34-17099. U.S. Sec. and Exchange Comm., SEC Release\nNo. 34-18255 (Nov. 13, 1981), available at http://www.sec.gov/news/\ndigest/1981/dig111381.pdf.\n399\nBoth DOJ’s opinion procedure releases (from 1993 to present) and\nreview procedure releases (from 1980-1992) are available at http://www.\njustice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/opinion.\n400\nThe full regulations relating to DOJ’s opinion procedure are available\nat http://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/docs/frgncrpt.pdf.\n401\n28 C.F.R. § 80.1.\n402\n28 C.F.R. § 80.3.\n403\n28 C.F.R. § 80.12 (“Neither the submission of a request for an\nFCPA Opinion, its pendency, nor the issuance of an FCPA Opinion,\nshall in any way alter the responsibility of an issuer to comply with the\naccounting requirements of 15 U.S.C. 78m(b)(2) and (3).”).\n404\n28 C.F.R. § 80.4.\n405\n28 C.F.R. § 80.5.\n406\n28 C.F.R. § 80.6.\n407\n28 C.F.R. § 80.14(a). This non-disclosure policy applies regardless of\nwhether DOJ responds to the request or the party withdraws the request\nbefore receiving a response. Id.\n408\n28 C.F.R. § 80.6.\n409\n28 C.F.R. § 80.2.\n410\nIn connection with any request for an FCPA opinion, DOJ may\nconduct whatever independent investigation it believes appropriate. 28\nC.F.R. § 80.7.\n411\n28 C.F.R. § 80.15. Once a request is withdrawn, it has no effect.\nHowever, DOJ reserves the right to retain a copy of any FCPA\nopinion request, documents, and information submitted during the\nopinion release procedure for any governmental purpose, subject to the\nrestrictions on disclosures in 28 C.F.R. § 80.14.\n412\n28 C.F.R. § 80.8.\n413\n28 C.F.R. § 80.7. “Such additional information, if furnished orally,\nmust be confirmed in writing promptly. The same person who signed\nthe initial request must sign the written, supplemental information and\nmust again certify it to be a true, correct and complete disclosure of the\nrequested information.” Id.\n414\n28 C.F.R. § 80.9 (“No oral clearance, release or other statement\n119\npurporting to limit the enforcement discretion of the Department of\nJustice may be given. The requesting issuer or domestic concern may rely\nonly upon a written FCPA opinion letter signed by the Attorney General\nor his designee.”).\n415\n28 C.F.R. § 80.8. FCPA opinions do not bind or obligate any agency\nother than DOJ. They also do not affect the requesting party’s obligations\nto any other agency or under any statutory or regulatory provision other\nthan those specifically cited in the particular FCPA opinion. 28 C.F.R. §\n80.11. If the conduct for which an FCPA opinion is requested is subject\nto approval by any other agency, such FCPA opinion may not be taken\nto indicate DOJ’s views on any legal or factual issues before that other\nagency. 28 C.F.R. § 80.13.\n416\n28 C.F.R. § 80.10. DOJ can rebut this presumption by a\npreponderance of the evidence. A court determining whether the\npresumption has been rebutted weighs all relevant factors, including\nwhether the submitted information was accurate and complete and the\nactivity was within the scope of conduct specified in the request. Id. As of\nSeptember 2012, DOJ has never pursued an enforcement action against a\nparty for conduct that formed the basis of an FCPA opinion stating that\nthe prospective conduct would violate DOJ’s present enforcement policy.\n417\nAs a general matter, DOJ normally anonymizes much of the\ninformation in its publicly released opinions and includes the general\nnature and circumstances of the proposed conduct. DOJ does not release\nthe identity of any foreign sales agents or other types of identifying\ninformation. 28 C.F.R. § 80.14(b). However, DOJ may release the\nidentity of the requesting party, the foreign country in which the\nproposed conduct is to take place, and any actions DOJ took in response\nto the FCPA opinion request. Id. If a party believes that an opinion\ncontains proprietary information, it may request that DOJ remove or\nanonymize those portions of the opinion before it is publicly released. 28\nC.F.R. § 80.14(c).\n418\n28 C.F.R. § 80.16.\nAPPENDIX\nEndnotes\n120\nFCPA Unit\nFraud Section, Criminal Division\nU.S. Department of Justice\n1400 New York Avenue, N.W.\nWashington, DC 20005\nhttp://www.justice.gov/criminal/fraud/fcpa/\nFCPA Unit\nEnforcement Division\nU.S. Securities & Exchange Commission\n100 F Street, NE\nWashington, DC 20549\nhttp://www.sec.gov/spotlight/fcpa.shtml",
