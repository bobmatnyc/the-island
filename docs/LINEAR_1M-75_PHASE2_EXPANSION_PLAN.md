## Quality Assurance Checkpoints

### Pre-Import Validation
**Article-Level Checks**:
- [ ] All URLs accessible (HTTP 200 or archived)
- [ ] Publication is Tier 1 (credibility ≥0.90)
- [ ] Word count ≥750 words
- [ ] 2-3 sentence excerpt written
- [ ] Entities matched to canonical names
- [ ] Tags relevant and descriptive
- [ ] Published date in ISO format (YYYY-MM-DD)

**Batch-Level Checks**:
- [ ] 30-40 articles per batch (flexibility for quality)
- [ ] No duplicate URLs across batches
- [ ] Publication balance maintained (<20/source)
- [ ] Entity diversity (multiple entities covered)
- [ ] Geographic/topic mix appropriate

### Post-Import QA
**Database Validation**:
```bash
# Check import success
curl http://localhost:8081/api/news/stats

# Verify entity linking
curl 'http://localhost:8081/api/news/articles?entity=jeffrey+epstein'

# Check publication counts
curl http://localhost:8081/api/news/sources
```

**Expected Results**:
- Import success rate: ≥95%
- Entity mention accuracy: 100%
- Credibility score average: ≥0.90
- No broken URLs in database

### Regression Testing
**After Each Batch**:
- [ ] News API endpoints still functional
- [ ] Entity filtering works correctly
- [ ] Date ranges accurate
- [ ] Statistics calculations correct
- [ ] Frontend displays new articles

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### Risk 1: Paywall Access
**Challenge**: NYT, WaPo, WSJ have paywalls
**Impact**: HIGH - Reduces available tier-1 sources
**Mitigation**:
- Use archive.org for older articles (pre-paywall)
- Focus on articles with accessible excerpts/summaries
- Prioritize open-access tier-1 sources (NPR, BBC, Reuters, AP)
- Library database access (if available)
- Note paywall status in metadata for transparency

**Contingency**: If paywall blocks 30%+ of target articles, pivot to:
- ProPublica (open access investigative)
- The Guardian (open access)
- Al Jazeera (open access)
- PBS NewsHour (open access)

### Risk 2: Link Rot
**Challenge**: Older articles (2006-2015) may have dead links
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Affects historical coverage
**Mitigation**:
- Check archive.org before adding article
- Store archive_url as backup
- Prioritize recent articles (2018-2024)
- For critical older articles, use archived versions as primary URL

**Success Metric**: ≥95% of articles have accessible URL (live or archived)

### Risk 3: Source Diversity Limits
**Challenge**: Guardian at 24 articles (OVER limit)
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Reduces publication diversity
**Mitigation**:
- FREEZE Guardian additions (24 is final count)
- Expand WSJ (3→18), AP (1→15), Bloomberg (0→15)
- Add ProPublica, Vanity Fair, The Atlantic
- Focus on underutilized tier-1 sources

**Target**: 27-32 unique publications by Phase 2 completion

### Risk 4: Entity Coverage Gaps
**Challenge**: Some entities under-represented (Bill Clinton: 4 articles)
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Unbalanced network analysis
**Mitigation**:
- Targeted search for under-represented entities
- Batch 9 focus on financial network (Wexner, Black)
- Ensure major figures have ≥10 articles each
- Secondary figures have ≥5 articles

**Success Metric**: Top 20 entities all have ≥8 articles

### Risk 5: Import Script Complexity
**Challenge**: 10 batches × 35 articles = significant manual effort
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM - Time-consuming but manageable
**Mitigation**:
- Use proven template from Phase 1
- Copy-paste structure, only update BATCH_ARTICLES
- Dry-run testing before live import
- Incremental progress (1 batch/week sustainable pace)

**Timeline**: 10 batches × 3 weeks = 30 weeks (7-8 months)
**Accelerated**: 2 batches/month = 5 months

### Risk 6: Credibility Score Consistency
**Challenge**: Maintaining 0.90+ average across 350 new articles
**Impact**: MEDIUM - Quality standard enforcement
**Mitigation**:
- Strict tier-1 source policy
- Manual review of borderline sources (0.88-0.92 range)
- Reject articles from non-tier-1 sources
- Peer review of batch credibility scores before import

**Success Metric**: Phase 2 average credibility ≥0.90 (matching Phase 1)
